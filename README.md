## Hermes: Centralized Cybersecurity Updates

In Greek mythology, Hermes was the messenger of the gods, a patron of travelers, and a protector of merchants, orators, and even thieves. In the cyber world, our Hermes channels that spiritâ€”delivering SaaS status, hackcidents, intel, news, and exploit (SHINE) updates straight to you with no nonsense.
