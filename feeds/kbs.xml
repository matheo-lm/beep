										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many successful phishing attacks result in a financial loss or malware infection. But falling for some phishing scams, like those currently targeting Russians searching online for organizations that are fighting the Kremlin war machine, can cost you your freedom or your life.</p>
<div id="attachment_70811" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-70811" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-70811" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/legionlibertyarmy.png" alt="" width="750" height="420" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/legionlibertyarmy.png 1430w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/legionlibertyarmy-768x430.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/legionlibertyarmy-782x437.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><p id="caption-attachment-70811" class="wp-caption-text">The real website of the Ukrainian paramilitary group &#8220;Freedom of Russia&#8221; legion. The text has been machine-translated from Russian.</p></div>
<p>Researchers at the security firm <strong>Silent Push</strong> mapped a network of several dozen phishing domains that spoof the recruitment websites of Ukrainian paramilitary groups, as well as Ukrainian government intelligence sites.</p>
<p>The website <strong>legiohliberty[.]army</strong> features a carbon copy of the homepage for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_Russia_Legion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Freedom of Russia Legion</a> (a.k.a. &#8220;Free Russia Legion&#8221;), a three-year-old Ukraine-based paramilitary unit made up of Russian citizens who oppose Vladimir Putin and his invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>The phony version of that website copies the legitimate site &#8212; <strong>legionliberty[.]army &#8212; </strong>providing an interactive <strong>Google Form</strong> where interested applicants can share their contact and personal details. The form asks visitors to provide their name, gender, age, email address and/or Telegram handle, country, citizenship, experience in the armed forces; political views; motivations for joining; and any bad habits.</p>
<p>&#8220;Participation in such anti-war actions is considered illegal in the Russian Federation, and participating citizens are regularly charged and arrested,&#8221; Silent Push wrote in a report released today. &#8220;All observed campaigns had similar traits and shared a common objective: collecting personal information from site-visiting victims. Our team believes it is likely that this campaign is the work of either Russian Intelligence Services or a threat actor with similarly aligned motives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Silent Push&#8217;s <strong>Zach Edwards</strong> said the fake Legion Liberty site shared multiple connections with <strong>rusvolcorps[.]net</strong>. That domain mimics the recruitment page for a Ukrainian far-right paramilitary group called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Volunteer_Corps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Russian Volunteer Corps</a> (rusvolcorps[.]com), and uses a similar Google Forms page to collect information from would-be members.</p>
<p>Other domains Silent Push connected to the phishing scheme include: <strong>ciagov[.]icu</strong>, which mirrors the content on the official website of the <strong>U.S. Central Intelligence Agency</strong>; and <strong>hochuzhitlife[.]com</strong>, which spoofs the <strong>Ministry of Defense of Ukraine &amp; General Directorate of Intelligence</strong> (whose actual domain is <strong>hochuzhit[.]com</strong>).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-70814" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/recruit-form.png" alt="" width="749" height="775" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/recruit-form.png 790w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/recruit-form-768x794.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/recruit-form-782x809.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" /></p>
<p>According to Edwards, there are no signs that these phishing sites are being advertised via email. Rather, it appears those responsible are promoting them by manipulating the search engine results shown when someone searches for one of these anti-Putin organizations.</p>
<p>In August 2024, security researcher <strong>Artem Tamoian</strong> posted <a href="https://x.com/artemtam" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Twitter/X</a> about how he received startlingly different results when he searched for &#8220;Freedom of Russia legion&#8221; in Russia&#8217;s largest domestic search engine <strong>Yandex</strong> versus Google.com. The top result returned by Google was the legion&#8217;s actual website, while the first result on Yandex was a phishing page targeting the group.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think at least some of them are surely promoted via search,&#8221; Tamoian said of the phishing domains. &#8220;My first thread on that accuses Yandex, but apart from Yandex those websites are consistently ranked above legitimate in DuckDuckGo and Bing. Initially, I didn&#8217;t realize the scale of it. They keep appearing to this day.&#8221;<span id="more-70785"></span></p>
<p>Tamoian, a native Russian who left the country in 2019, is the founder of the cyber investigation platform <a href="https://malfors.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">malfors.com</a>. He recently discovered two other sites impersonating the Ukrainian paramilitary groups &#8212; <strong>legionliberty[.]world</strong> and <strong>rusvolcorps[.]ru</strong> &#8212; and reported both to Cloudflare. When Cloudflare responded by blocking the sites with a phishing warning, the real Internet address of these sites <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rusvolcorps-stark.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was exposed</a> as belonging to a known &#8220;bulletproof hosting&#8221; network called <strong>Stark Industries Solutions Ltd</strong>.</p>
<p>Stark Industries Solutions appeared two weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, materializing out of nowhere with hundreds of thousands of Internet addresses in its stable &#8212; many of them originally assigned to Russian government organizations. In May 2024, KrebsOnSecurity <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/05/stark-industries-solutions-an-iron-hammer-in-the-cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published a deep dive on Stark</a>, which has repeatedly been used to host infrastructure for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, phishing, malware and disinformation campaigns from Russian intelligence agencies and pro-Kremlin hacker groups.</p>
<p>In March 2023, Russia’s Supreme Court designated the Freedom of Russia legion as a terrorist organization, meaning that Russians caught communicating with the group could face between 10 and 20 years in prison.</p>
<p>Tamoian said those searching online for information about these paramilitary groups have become easy prey for Russian security services.</p>
<p>&#8220;I started looking into those phishing websites, because I kept stumbling upon news that someone gets arrested for trying to join [the] Ukrainian Army or for trying to help them,&#8221; Tamoian told KrebsOnSecurity. &#8220;I have also seen reports [of] FSB contacting people impersonating Ukrainian officers, as well as using fake Telegram bots, so I thought fake websites might be an option as well.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_70810" style="width: 622px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-70810" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-70810" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/legion-arrests.png" alt="" width="612" height="802" /><p id="caption-attachment-70810" class="wp-caption-text">Search results showing news articles about people in Russia being sentenced to lengthy prison terms for attempting to aid Ukrainian paramilitary groups.</p></div>
<p>Tamoian said <a href="https://en.zona.media/article/2024/10/15/phish-trl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports surface regularly in Russia</a> about people being arrested for trying carry out an action requested by a &#8220;Ukrainian recruiter,&#8221; with the courts unfailingly imposing harsh sentences regardless of the defendant’s age.</p>
<p>&#8220;This keeps happening regularly, but usually there are no details about how exactly the person gets caught,&#8221; he said. &#8220;All cases related to state treason [and] terrorism are classified, so there are barely any details.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tamoian said while he has no direct evidence linking any of the reported arrests and convictions to these phishing sites, he is certain the sites are part of a larger campaign by the Russian government.</p>
<p>&#8220;Considering that they keep them alive and keep spawning more, I assume it might be an efficient thing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They are on top of DuckDuckGo and Yandex, so it unfortunately works.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Authorities in at least two U.S. states last week independently announced arrests of Chinese nationals accused of perpetrating a novel form of tap-to-pay fraud using mobile devices. Details released by authorities so far indicate the mobile wallets being used by the scammers were created through online phishing scams, and that the accused were relying on a custom Android app to relay tap-to-pay transactions from mobile devices located in China.</p>
<div id="attachment_70773" style="width: 758px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-70773" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-70773" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/kcso-taptopay.png" alt="" width="748" height="413" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/kcso-taptopay.png 903w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/kcso-taptopay-768x424.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/kcso-taptopay-782x431.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px" /><p id="caption-attachment-70773" class="wp-caption-text">Image: WLVT-8.</p></div>
<p>Authorities in Knoxville, Tennessee last week <a href="https://knoxsheriff.org/tap-2-pay-fraud-scheme-bust/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> they arrested 11 Chinese nationals accused of buying tens of thousands of dollars worth of gift cards at local retailers with mobile wallets created through online phishing scams. The Knox County Sheriff&#8217;s office said the arrests are considered the first in the nation for a new type of tap-to-pay fraud.</p>
<p>Responding to questions about what makes this scheme so remarkable, Knox County said that while it appears the fraudsters are simply buying gift cards, in fact they are using multiple transactions to purchase various gift cards and are plying their scam from state to state.</p>
<p>&#8220;These offenders have been traveling nationwide, using stolen credit card information to purchase gift cards and launder funds,&#8221; Knox County Chief Deputy <strong>Bernie Lyon</strong> wrote. &#8220;During Monday’s operation, we recovered gift cards valued at over $23,000, all bought with unsuspecting victims’ information.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked for specifics about the mobile devices seized from the suspects, Lyon said &#8220;tap-to-pay fraud involves a group <em>utilizing Android phones to conduct Apple Pay transactions</em> utilizing stolen or compromised credit/debit card information,&#8221; [emphasis added].</p>
<p>Lyon declined to offer additional specifics about the mechanics of the scam, citing an ongoing investigation.</p>
<p><strong>Ford Merrill</strong> works in security research at <a href="https://www.secalliance.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SecAlliance</a>, a <a href="https://www.csis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CSIS Security Group</a> company. Merrill said there aren&#8217;t many valid use cases for Android phones to transmit Apple Pay transactions. That is, he said, unless they are running a custom Android app that KrebsOnSecurity wrote about last month as part of <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/02/how-phished-data-turns-into-apple-google-wallets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a deep dive into the operations of China-based phishing cartels</a> that are breathing new life into the payment card fraud industry (a.k.a. &#8220;carding&#8221;).</p>
<p>How are these China-based phishing groups obtaining stolen payment card data and then loading it onto Google and Apple phones? It all starts with phishing.</p>
<p>If you own a mobile phone, the chances are excellent that at some point in the past two years it has received at least one phishing message that spoofs the <strong>U.S. Postal Service</strong> to supposedly collect some outstanding delivery fee, or an SMS that pretends to be a local toll road operator warning of a delinquent toll fee.</p>
<p>These messages are being sent through sophisticated phishing kits sold by several cybercriminals based in mainland China. And they are not traditional SMS phishing or “<strong>smishing</strong>” messages, as they bypass the mobile networks entirely. Rather, the missives are sent through the <strong>Apple iMessage</strong> service and through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Communication_Services" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RCS</a>, the functionally equivalent technology on <strong>Google</strong> phones.</p>
<p>People who enter their payment card data at one of these sites will be told their financial institution needs to verify the small transaction by sending a one-time passcode to the customer’s mobile device. In reality, that code will be sent by the victim’s financial institution in response to a request by the fraudsters to link the phished card data to a mobile wallet.</p>
<p>If the victim then provides that one-time code, the phishers will link the card data to a new mobile wallet from Apple or Google, loading the wallet onto a mobile phone that the scammers control. These phones are then loaded with multiple stolen wallets (often between 5-10 per device) and sold in bulk to scammers on Telegram.</p>
<div id="attachment_70436" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-70436" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-70436" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/phishingphones.png" alt="" width="750" height="567" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/phishingphones.png 1160w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/phishingphones-768x581.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/phishingphones-782x591.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><p id="caption-attachment-70436" class="wp-caption-text">An image from the Telegram channel for a popular Chinese smishing kit vendor shows 10 mobile phones for sale, each loaded with 5-7 digital wallets from different financial institutions.</p></div>
<p>Merrill found that at least one of the Chinese phishing groups sells an Android app called “<strong>Z-NFC</strong>” that can relay a valid NFC transaction to anywhere in the world. The user simply waves their phone at a local payment terminal that accepts Apple or Google pay, and the app relays an NFC transaction over the Internet from a phone in China.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would be shocked if this wasn&#8217;t the NFC relay app,&#8221; Merrill said, concerning the arrested suspects in Tennessee.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe loading="lazy" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ekqZjPAxB4c?si=hYLqGPIBrNthAg9_" width="750" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>Merrill said the Z-NFC software can work from anywhere in the world, and that one phishing gang offers the software for $500 a month.</p>
<p>&#8220;It can relay both NFC enabled tap-to-pay as well as any digital wallet,&#8221; Merrill said. &#8220;They even have 24-hour support.&#8221;<span id="more-70697"></span></p>
<p>On March 16, the ABC affiliate in Sacramento (<strong>ABC10</strong>), Calif. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUjaj0d1T6A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aired a segment</a> about two Chinese nationals who were arrested after using an app to run stolen credit cards at a local Target store. The news story quoted investigators saying the men were trying to buy gift cards using a mobile app that cycled through more than 80 stolen payment cards.</p>
<p>ABC10 reported that while most of those transactions were declined, the suspects still made off with $1,400 worth of gift cards. After their arrests, both men reportedly admitted that they were being paid $250 a day to conduct the fraudulent transactions.</p>
<p>Merrill said it&#8217;s not unusual for fraud groups to advertise this kind of work on social media networks, including TikTok.</p>
<p>A <strong>CBS News</strong> <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sacramento/news/sacramento-county-credit-card-scheme-arrest-chinese-nationals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">story</a> on the Sacramento arrests said one of the suspects tried to use 42 separate bank cards, but that 32 were declined. Even so, the man still was reportedly able to spend $855 in the transactions.</p>
<p>Likewise, the suspect&#8217;s alleged accomplice tried 48 transactions on separate cards, finding success 11 times and spending $633, CBS reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s interesting that so many of the cards were declined,&#8221; Merrill said. &#8220;One reason this might be is that banks are getting better at detecting this type of fraud. The other could be that the cards were already used and so they were already flagged for fraud even before these guys had a chance to use them. So there could be some element of just sending these guys out to stores to see if it works, and if not they&#8217;re on their own.&#8221;</p>
<p>Merrill&#8217;s investigation into the Telegram sales channels for these China-based phishing gangs shows their phishing sites are actively manned by fraudsters who sit in front of giant racks of Apple and Google phones that are used to send the spam and respond to replies in real time.</p>
<p>In other words, the phishing websites are powered by real human operators as long as new messages are being sent. Merrill said the criminals appear to send only a few dozen messages at a time, likely because completing the scam takes manual work by the human operators in China. After all, most one-time codes used for mobile wallet provisioning are generally only good for a few minutes before they expire.</p>

<p>On March 13, a Maryland district court judge <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fired-cisa-probationary-employees-reinstated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ordered</a> the Trump administration to reinstate more than 130 probationary CISA employees who were fired last month.

They are among nearly 25,000 fired federal workers who are in the process of being rehired.</p>
<p>A notice covering the CISA homepage said the administration is making every effort to contact those who were unlawfully fired in mid-February.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please provide a password protected attachment that provides your full name, your dates of employment (including date of termination), and one other identifying factor such as date of birth or social security number,&#8221; the message reads. &#8220;Please, to the extent that it is available, attach any termination notice.&#8221;</p>
<p>The message didn&#8217;t specify how affected CISA employees should share the password for any attached files, so the implicit expectation is that employees should just include the plaintext password in their message.</p>
<p>Email is about as secure as a postcard sent through the mail, because anyone who manages to intercept the missive anywhere along its path of delivery can likely read it. In security terms, that&#8217;s the equivalent of encrypting sensitive data while also attaching the secret key needed to view the information.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, a great many antivirus and security scanners have trouble inspecting password-protected files, meaning the administration&#8217;s instructions are likely to increase the risk that malware submitted by cybercriminals could be accepted and opened by U.S. government employees.</p>
<p>The message in the screenshot above was removed from the CISA homepage Tuesday evening and replaced with a much shorter notice directing former CISA employees to contact a specific email address. But a slightly different version of the same message originally posted to CISA&#8217;s website <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/alerts/uscis-probationary-reinstatements" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still exists</a> at the website for the <strong>U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services</strong>, which likewise instructs those fired employees who wish to be rehired and put on leave to send a password-protected email attachment with sensitive personal data.</p>
<div id="attachment_70736" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-70736" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-70736" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/uscis-probation.png" alt="" width="750" height="490" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/uscis-probation.png 1094w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/uscis-probation-768x502.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/uscis-probation-782x511.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><p id="caption-attachment-70736" class="wp-caption-text">A message from the White House to fired federal employees at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services instructs recipients to email personal information in a password-protected attachment.</p></div>
<p>This is hardly the first example of the administration discarding Security 101 practices in the name of expediency. Last month, the <strong>Central Intelligence Agency</strong> (CIA) sent an unencrypted email to the White House with the first names and first letter of the last names of recently hired CIA officers who might be easy to fire.</p>
<p>As cybersecurity journalist <strong>Shane Harris</strong> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2025/02/doge-intelligence-agencies-harm/681667/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted</a> in <em>The Atlantic</em>, even those fragments of information could be useful to foreign spies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the weekend, a former senior CIA official showed me the steps by which a foreign adversary who knew only his first name and last initial could have managed to identify him from the single line of the congressional record where his full name was published more than 20 years ago, when he became a member of the Foreign Service,&#8221; Harris wrote. &#8220;The former official was undercover at the time as a State Department employee. If a foreign government had known even part of his name from a list of confirmed CIA officers, his cover would have been blown.&#8221;</p>
<p>The White House has also fired at least 100 intelligence staffers from the <strong>National Security Agency </strong>(NSA), reportedly for using an internal NSA chat tool <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/us/politics/gabbard-nsa-firing-explicit-chat.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to discuss their personal lives and politics</a>. Testifying before the House Select Committee on the Communist Party earlier this month, the NSA&#8217;s former top cybersecurity official said the Trump administration&#8217;s attempts to mass fire probationary federal employees will be &#8220;devastating&#8221; to U.S. cybersecurity operations.</p>
<p><strong>Rob Joyce</strong>, who spent 34 years at the NSA, told Congress how important those employees are in sustaining an aggressive stance against China in cyberspace.</p>
<p>&#8220;At my former agency, remarkable technical talent was recruited into developmental programs that provided intensive unique training and hands-on experience to cultivate vital skills,” Joyce <a href="https://cyberscoop.com/joyce-china-probationary-firings-devastating-congress/?utm_campaign=CyberScoop%20-%20Editorial&amp;utm_content=326616240&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=linkedin&amp;hss_channel=lcp-11061843" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told the panel</a>. &#8220;Eliminating probationary employees will destroy a pipeline of top talent responsible for hunting and eradicating [Chinese] threats.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both the message to fired CISA workers and DOGE&#8217;s ongoing efforts to bypass vetted government networks for a faster Wi-Fi signal are emblematic of this administration&#8217;s overall approach to even basic security measures: To go around them, or just pretend they don&#8217;t exist <a href="https://fs.blog/chestertons-fence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for a good reason</a>.</p>
<p>On Monday, <em>The New York Times</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/us/politics/elon-musk-starlink-white-house.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that U.S. Secret Service agents at the White House were briefly on alert last month when a trusted captain of Elon Musk&#8217;s &#8220;Department of Government Efficiency&#8221; (DOGE) visited the roof of the Eisenhower building inside the White House compound &#8212; to see about setting up a dish to receive satellite Internet access directly from Musk&#8217;s <strong>Starlink</strong> service.</p>
<p>The White House press secretary told The Times that Starlink had &#8220;donated&#8221; the service and that the gift had been vetted by the lawyer overseeing ethics issues in the White House Counsel’s Office. The White House claims the service is necessary because its wireless network is too slow.</p>
<p><strong>Jake Williams</strong>, vice president for research and development at the cybersecurity consulting firm <strong>Hunter Strategy</strong>, told The Times &#8220;it&#8217;s super rare” to install Starlink or another internet provider as a replacement for existing government infrastructure that has been vetted and secured.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can’t think of a time that I have heard of that,&#8221; Williams said. &#8220;It introduces another attack point,” Williams said. &#8220;But why introduce that risk?&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <strong>NBC News</strong> <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/elon-musk/elon-musk-starlink-growing-footprint-federal-government-rcna195400" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported on March 7</a> that Starlink is expanding its footprint across the federal government.</p>
<p>&#8220;Multiple federal agencies are exploring the idea of adopting SpaceX’s Starlink for internet access — and at least one agency, the General Services Administration (GSA), has done so at the request of Musk’s staff, according to someone who worked at the GSA last month and is familiar with its network operations — despite a vow by Musk and Trump to slash the overall federal budget,&#8221; NBC wrote.<span id="more-70729"></span></p>
<p>The longtime Musk employee who encountered the Secret Service on the roof in the White House complex was <strong>Christopher Stanley</strong>, the 33-year-old senior director for security engineering at <strong>X</strong> and principal security engineer at SpaceX.</p>
<p>On Monday, Bloomberg broke the news that Stanley had been tapped for a seat on the board of directors at the mortgage giant <strong>Fannie Mae</strong>. Stanley was added to the board alongside newly confirmed Federal Housing Finance Agency director <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Pulte" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bill Pulte</a>, the grandson of the late housing businessman and founder of PulteGroup &#8212; William J. Pulte.</p>
<p>In a nod to his new board role atop an agency that helps drive the nation&#8217;s $12 trillion mortgage market, Stanley retweeted a Bloomberg story about the hire with a smiley emoji and the comment &#8220;Tech Support.&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-70750" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/stanley-fannie.png" alt="" width="750" height="676" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/stanley-fannie.png 905w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/stanley-fannie-768x692.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/stanley-fannie-782x705.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p>But earlier today, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-19/musk-ally-stanley-abruptly-resigns-from-fannie-mae-board" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Stanley had abruptly resigned from the Fannie board, and that details about the reason for his quick departure weren&#8217;t immediately clear. As <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/02/trump-2-0-brings-cuts-to-cyber-consumer-protections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first reported here</a> last month, Stanley had a brush with celebrity on Twitter in 2015 when he leaked the user database for the DDoS-for-hire service <strong>LizardStresser</strong>, and soon faced threats of physical violence against his family.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/01/another-lizard-arrested-lizard-lair-hacked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2015 story on that leak</a> did not name Stanley, but he exposed himself as the source by posting a video about it on his Youtube channel. A review of domain names registered by Stanley shows he went by the nickname “enKrypt,” and was the former owner of a pirated software and hacking forum called <strong>error33[.]net</strong>, as well as <strong>theC0re</strong>, a video game cheating community.</p>
<p>Stanley is one of more than 50 DOGE workers, mostly young men and women who have worked with one or more of Musk&#8217;s companies. The Trump administration remains <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/02/teen-on-musks-doge-team-graduated-from-the-com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dogged by questions</a> about how many &#8212; if any &#8212; of the DOGE workers were put through the gauntlet of a thorough security background investigation before being given access to such sensitive government databases.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s largely because in one of his first executive actions after being sworn in for a second term on Jan. 20, President Trump <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/memorandum-to-resolve-the-backlog-of-security-clearances-for-executive-office-of-the-president-personnel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declared</a> that the security clearance process was simply too onerous and time-consuming, and that anyone so designated by the White House counsel would have full top secret/sensitive compartmented information (TS/SCI) clearances for up to six months. Translation: We <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IG3zqvUqJY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accepted the risk</a>, so TAH-DAH! No risk!</p>
<p>Presumably, this is the same counsel who saw no ethical concerns with Musk &#8220;donating&#8221; Starlink to the White House, or with President Trump summoning the media to film him hawking Cybertrucks and Teslas (a.k.a. &#8220;Teslers&#8221;) on the White House lawn last week.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe loading="lazy" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uUntzU4Toy4?si=76K-2CkYWGNN0kYh" width="660" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>Mr. Musk&#8217;s unelected role as head of an ad hoc executive entity that is gleefully firing federal workers and feeding federal agencies into &#8220;the wood chipper&#8221; has seen his Tesla stock price plunge in recent weeks, while firebombings and other vandalism attacks on property carrying the Tesla logo are cropping up across the U.S. and overseas and driving down Tesla sales.</p>
<p>President Trump and his attorney general Pam Bondi have dubiously asserted that those responsible for attacks on Tesla dealerships are committing &#8220;domestic terrorism,&#8221; and that vandals will be prosecuted accordingly. But it&#8217;s not clear this administration would recognize a real domestic security threat if it was ensconced squarely behind the Resolute Desk.</p>
<p>Or at the pinnacle of the <strong>Federal Bureau of Investigation</strong> (FBI). <em>The Washington Post</em> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/07/patel-fbi-russia-lopatonok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> last month that Trump&#8217;s new FBI director <strong>Kash Patel</strong> was paid $25,000 last year by a film company owned by a dual U.S. Russian citizen that has made programs promoting &#8220;deep state&#8221; conspiracy theories pushed by the Kremlin.</p>
<p>&#8220;The resulting six-part documentary appeared on Tucker Carlson’s online network, itself a reliable conduit for Kremlin propaganda,&#8221; The Post reported. &#8220;In the film, Patel made his now infamous pledge to shut down the FBI’s headquarters in Washington and &#8216;open it up as a museum to the deep state.'&#8221;</p>
<p>When the head of the FBI is promising to turn his own agency headquarters into a mocking public exhibit on the U.S. National Mall, it may seem silly to fuss over the White House&#8217;s clumsy and insulting instructions to former employees they unlawfully fired.</p>
<p>Indeed, one consistent feedback I&#8217;ve heard from a subset of readers here is something to this effect: &#8220;I used to like reading your stuff more when you weren&#8217;t writing about politics all the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>My response to that is: &#8220;Yeah, me too.&#8221; It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m suddenly interested in writing about political matters; it&#8217;s that various actions by this administration keep intruding on my areas of coverage.</p>
<p>A less charitable interpretation of that reader comment is that anyone still giving such feedback is either dangerously uninformed, being disingenuous, or just doesn’t want to keep being reminded that they’re on the side of the villains, despite all the evidence showing it.</p>
<p>Article II of the U.S. Constitution unambiguously states that the president shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed. But almost from Day One of his second term, Mr. Trump has been acting in violation of his sworn duty as president by choosing not to enforce laws passed by Congress (TikTok ban, anyone?), by freezing funds already allocated by Congress, and most recently by flouting a federal court order while simultaneously <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/us/politics/trump-deportations-constitutional-crisis-impeachment.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">calling for the impeachment of the judge who issued it</a>. Sworn to uphold, protect and defend The Constitution, President Trump appears to be creating new constitutional challenges with almost each passing day.</p>
<p>When Mr. Trump was voted out of office in November 2020, he turned to baseless claims of widespread &#8220;election fraud&#8221; to explain his loss &#8212; with deadly and long-lasting consequences. This time around, the rallying cry of DOGE and White House is &#8220;government fraud,&#8221; which gives the administration a certain amount of cover for its actions among a base of voters that has long sought to shrink the size and cost of government.</p>
<p>In reality, &#8220;government fraud&#8221; has become a term of derision and public scorn applied to anything or anyone the current administration doesn&#8217;t like. If DOGE and the White House were truly interested in trimming government waste, fraud and abuse, they could scarcely do better than consult the inspectors general fighting it at various federal agencies.</p>
<p>After all, the inspectors general likely know exactly where a great deal of the federal government&#8217;s fiscal skeletons are buried. Instead, Mr. Trump <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-firings-watchdogs-inspectors-general-60-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fired at least 17 inspectors general</a>, leaving the government without critical oversight of agency activities. That action is unlikely to stem government fraud; if anything, it will only encourage such activity.</p>
<p>As <em>Techdirt</em> founder <strong>Mike Masnick</strong> noted in a recent column &#8220;<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/03/04/why-techdirt-is-now-a-democracy-blog-whether-we-like-it-or-not/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Why Techdirt is Now a Democracy Blog (Whether We Like it or Not)</a>,&#8221; when the very institutions that made American innovation possible are being systematically dismantled, it’s not a &#8220;political&#8221; story anymore: It’s a story about whether the environment that enabled all the other stories we cover will continue to exist.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is why tech journalism’s perspective is so crucial right now,&#8221; Masnick wrote. &#8220;We’ve spent decades documenting how technology and entrepreneurship can either strengthen or undermine democratic institutions. We understand the dangers of concentrated power in the digital age. And we’ve watched in real-time as tech leaders who once championed innovation and openness now actively work to consolidate control and dismantle the very systems that enabled their success.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But right now, the story that matters most is how the dismantling of American institutions threatens everything else we cover,&#8221; Masnick continued. &#8220;When the fundamental structures that enable innovation, protect civil liberties, and foster open dialogue are under attack, every other tech policy story becomes secondary.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A clever malware deployment scheme <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/09/this-windows-powershell-phish-has-scary-potential/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first spotted in targeted attacks last year</a> has now gone mainstream. In this scam, dubbed &#8220;<strong>ClickFix</strong>,&#8221; the visitor to a hacked or malicious website is asked to distinguish themselves from bots by pressing a combination of keyboard keys that causes <strong>Microsoft Windows</strong> to download password-stealing malware.</p>
<p>ClickFix attacks mimic the &#8220;Verify You are a Human&#8221; tests that many websites use to separate real visitors from content-scraping bots. This particular scam usually starts with a website popup that looks something like this:</p>
<div id="attachment_68856" style="width: 793px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-68856" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-68856" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/verifyhuman.png" alt="" width="783" height="397" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/verifyhuman.png 783w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/verifyhuman-768x389.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 783px) 100vw, 783px" /><p id="caption-attachment-68856" class="wp-caption-text">This malware attack pretends to be a CAPTCHA intended to separate humans from bots.</p></div>
<p>Clicking the &#8220;I&#8217;m not a robot&#8221; button generates a pop-up message asking the user to take three sequential steps to prove their humanity.</p>
<div id="attachment_70703" style="width: 634px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-70703" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-70703 size-full" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/verifsteps.png" alt="" width="624" height="339" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/verifsteps.png 624w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/verifsteps-370x200.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /><p id="caption-attachment-70703" class="wp-caption-text">Executing this series of keypresses prompts Windows to download password-stealing malware.</p></div>
<p>Step 1 involves simultaneously pressing the keyboard key with the Windows icon and the letter &#8220;R,&#8221; which opens a Windows &#8220;Run&#8221; prompt that will execute any specified program that is already installed on the system.</p>
<p>Step 2 asks the user to press the &#8220;CTRL&#8221; key and the letter &#8220;V&#8221; at the same time, which pastes malicious code from the site&#8217;s virtual clipboard.</p>
<p>Step 3 — pressing the “Enter” key — causes Windows to download and launch malicious code through &#8220;<strong>mshta.exe</strong>,&#8221; a Windows program designed to run Microsoft HTML application files.</p>
<p>&#8220;This campaign delivers multiple families of commodity malware, including XWorm, Lumma stealer, VenomRAT, AsyncRAT, Danabot, and NetSupport RAT,&#8221; <strong>Microsoft</strong> wrote in <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/03/13/phishing-campaign-impersonates-booking-com-delivers-a-suite-of-credential-stealing-malware/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a blog post</a> on Thursday. &#8220;Depending on the specific payload, the specific code launched through mshta.exe varies. Some samples have downloaded PowerShell, JavaScript, and portable executable (PE) content.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Microsoft, hospitality workers are being tricked into downloading credential-stealing malware by cybercriminals impersonating <strong>Booking.com</strong>. The company said attackers have been sending malicious emails impersonating Booking.com, often referencing negative guest reviews, requests from prospective guests, or online promotion opportunities &#8212; all in a bid to convince people to step through one of these ClickFix attacks.<span id="more-70700"></span></p>
<p>In November 2024, KrebsOnSecurity reported that hundreds of hotels that use booking.com had been subject to targeted phishing attacks. Some of those lures worked, and allowed thieves to <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/11/booking-com-phishers-may-leave-you-with-reservations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gain control over booking.com accounts</a>. From there, they sent out phishing messages asking for financial information from people who&#8217;d just booked travel through the company&#8217;s app.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the security firm <strong>Arctic Wolf</strong> <a href="https://arcticwolf.com/resources/blog/healthcare-sector-targeted-by-fake-captcha-attack-on-hep2go-to-deliver-infostealer-malware/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">warned</a> about ClickFix attacks targeting people working in the healthcare sector. The company said those attacks leveraged malicious code stitched into the widely used physical therapy video site HEP2go that redirected visitors to a ClickFix prompt.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/clickfix-attacks-sector-alert-tlpclear.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alert</a> (PDF) released in October 2024 by the <strong>U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</strong> warned that the ClickFix attack can take many forms, including fake <strong>Google Chrome</strong> error pages and popups that spoof <strong>Facebook</strong>.</p>
<div id="attachment_70706" style="width: 1182px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-70706" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-70706" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/hhs-clickfix.png" alt="" width="1172" height="745" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/hhs-clickfix.png 1172w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/hhs-clickfix-768x488.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/hhs-clickfix-782x497.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 1172px) 100vw, 1172px" /><p id="caption-attachment-70706" class="wp-caption-text">ClickFix tactic used by malicious websites impersonating Google Chrome, Facebook, PDFSimpli, and reCAPTCHA. Source: Sekoia.</p></div>
<p>The ClickFix attack &#8212; and its reliance on mshta.exe &#8212; is reminiscent of phishing techniques employed for years that hid exploits inside <strong>Microsoft Office</strong> <strong>macros</strong>. Malicious macros became such a common malware threat that Microsoft was forced to start blocking macros by default in Office documents that try to download content from the web.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Microsoft</strong> today issued more than 50 security updates for its various <strong>Windows</strong> operating systems, including fixes for a whopping <em>six zero-day vulnerabilities</em> that are already seeing active exploitation.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-60331" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/winupdatedate.png" alt="" width="749" height="496" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/winupdatedate.png 923w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/winupdatedate-768x508.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/winupdatedate-782x518.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" /></p>
<p>Two of the zero-day flaws include <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-24991" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2025-24991</a> and <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-24993" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-24993&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1741811978241000&amp;usg=AOvVaw08YeX5TKKSxWlXHXx6FFHl">CVE-2025-24993</a>, both vulnerabilities in <strong>NTFS</strong>, the default file system for Windows and Windows Server. Both require the attacker to trick a target into mounting a malicious virtual hard disk. CVE-2025-24993 would lead to the possibility of local code execution, while CVE-2025-24991 could cause NTFS to disclose portions of memory.</p>
<p>Microsoft credits researchers at <strong>ESET</strong> with reporting the zero-day bug labeled <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-24983" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2025-24983</a>, an elevation of privilege vulnerability in older versions of Windows. ESET said the exploit was deployed via the <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/kaspersky-uncovers-pipemagic-backdoor-attacks-businesses-through-fake-chatgpt-application" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PipeMagic backdoor</a>, capable of exfiltrating data and enabling remote access to the machine.</p>
<p>ESET&#8217;s <strong>Filip</strong> <b>Jurčacko </b>said the exploit in the wild targets only older versions of Windows OS: Windows 8.1 and Server 2012 R2. Although still used by millions, security support for these products ended more than a year ago, and mainstream support ended years ago. However, ESET notes the vulnerability itself also is present in newer Windows OS versions, including <strong>Windows 10 build 1809</strong> and the still-supported <strong>Windows Server 2016</strong>.</p>
<p>Rapid7&#8217;s lead software engineer <strong>Adam Barnett</strong> said <strong>Windows 11</strong> and <strong>Server 2019</strong> onwards are not listed as receiving patches, so are presumably not vulnerable.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s not clear why newer Windows products dodged this particular bullet,&#8221; Barnett wrote. &#8220;The Windows 32 subsystem is still presumably alive and well, since there is no apparent mention of its demise on the Windows client OS deprecated features list.&#8221;<span id="more-70681"></span></p>
<p>The zero-day flaw <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-24984" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2025-24984</a> is another NTFS weakness that can be exploited by inserting a malicious USB drive into a Windows computer. Barnett said Microsoft&#8217;s advisory for this bug doesn&#8217;t quite join the dots, but successful exploitation appears to mean that portions of heap memory could be improperly dumped into a log file, which could then be combed through by an attacker hungry for privileged information.</p>
<p>&#8220;A relatively low CVSSv3 base score of 4.6 reflects the practical difficulties of real-world exploitation, but a motivated attacker can sometimes achieve extraordinary results starting from the smallest of toeholds, and Microsoft does rate this vulnerability as important on its own proprietary severity ranking scale,&#8221; Barnett said.</p>
<p>Another zero-day fixed this month &#8212; <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-24985" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2025-24985</a> &#8212; could allow attackers to install malicious code. As with the NTFS bugs, this one requires that the user mount a malicious virtual hard drive.</p>
<p>The final zero-day this month is <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-26633" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2025-26633</a>, a weakness in the <strong>Microsoft Management Console</strong>, a component of Windows that gives system administrators a way to configure and monitor the system. Exploiting this flaw requires the target to open a malicious file.</p>
<p>This month&#8217;s bundle of patch love from Redmond also addresses six other vulnerabilities Microsoft has rated &#8220;critical,&#8221; meaning that malware or malcontents could exploit them to seize control over vulnerable PCs with no help from users.</p>
<p>Barnett observed that this is now the sixth consecutive month where Microsoft has published zero-day vulnerabilities on Patch Tuesday without evaluating any of them as critical severity at time of publication.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Microsoft%20Patch%20Tuesday%3A%20March%202025/31756/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SANS Internet Storm Center</a> has a useful list of all the Microsoft patches released today, indexed by severity. Windows enterprise administrators would do well to keep an eye on <a href="http://www.askwoody.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">askwoody.com</a>, which often has the scoop on any patches causing problems. Please consider backing up your data before updating, and leave a comment below if you experience any issues applying this month&#8217;s updates.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Authorities in India today arrested the alleged co-founder of <strong>Garantex</strong>, a cryptocurrency exchange sanctioned by the U.S. government in 2022 for facilitating tens of billions of dollars in money laundering by transnational criminal and cybercriminal organizations. Sources close to the investigation told KrebsOnSecurity the Lithuanian national <strong>Aleksej Besciokov</strong>, 46, was apprehended while vacationing on the coast of India with his family.</p>
<div id="attachment_70665" style="width: 472px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-70665" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-70665" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Besciokov_Photo.png" alt="" width="462" height="552" /><p id="caption-attachment-70665" class="wp-caption-text">Aleksej Bešciokov, &#8220;proforg,&#8221; &#8220;iram&#8221;. Image: U.S. Secret Service.</p></div>
<p>On March 7, the <strong>U.S. Department of Justice</strong> (DOJ) unsealed <a href="https://www.justice.gov/media/1392316/dl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an indictment</a> against Besciokov and the other alleged co-founder of Garantex, <strong>Aleksandr Mira Serda</strong>, 40, a Russian national living in the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>Launched in 2019, Garantex was <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0701" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first sanctioned</a> by the U.S. Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control in April 2022 for receiving hundreds of millions in criminal proceeds, including funds used to facilitate hacking, ransomware, terrorism and drug trafficking. Since those penalties were levied, Garantex has processed more than $60 billion, according to the blockchain analysis company <strong>Elliptic.</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Garantex has been used in sanctions evasion by Russian elites, as well as to launder proceeds of crime including ransomware, darknet market trade and thefts attributed to North Korea’s Lazarus Group,&#8221; Elliptic wrote in <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/elliptic-in-action-garantex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a blog post</a>. &#8220;Garantex has also been implicated in enabling Russian oligarchs to move their wealth out of the country, following the invasion of Ukraine.&#8221;</p>
<p>The DOJ alleges Besciokov was Garantex&#8217;s primary technical administrator and responsible for obtaining and maintaining critical Garantex infrastructure, as well as reviewing and approving transactions. Mira Serda is allegedly Garantex’s co-founder and chief commercial officer.</p>
<div id="attachment_70666" style="width: 757px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-70666" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-70666" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/garantex-elliptic.png" alt="" width="747" height="492" /><p id="caption-attachment-70666" class="wp-caption-text">Image: elliptic.co</p></div>
<p>In conjunction with the release of the indictments, German and Finnish law enforcement seized servers hosting Garantex’s operations. A <a href="https://www.secretservice.gov/investigations/mostwanted/besciokov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;most wanted&#8221; notice</a> published by the <strong>U.S. Secret Service</strong> states that U.S. authorities separately obtained earlier copies of Garantex’s servers, including customer and accounting databases. Federal investigators say they also froze over $26 million in funds used to facilitate Garantex’s money laundering activities.</p>
<p>Besciokov was arrested within the past 24 hours while vacationing with his family in Varkala, a major coastal city in the southwest Indian state of Kerala. An officer with the local police department in Varkala confirmed Besciokov&#8217;s arrest, and said the suspect will appear in a Delhi court on March 14 to face charges.</p>
<div id="attachment_70667" style="width: 759px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-70667" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-70667" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/kerala-shutterstock.png" alt="" width="749" height="495" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/kerala-shutterstock.png 988w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/kerala-shutterstock-768x507.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/kerala-shutterstock-782x516.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" /><p id="caption-attachment-70667" class="wp-caption-text">Varkala Beach in Kerala, India.

<p><span id="more-70662"></span>The DOJ&#8217;s indictment says Besciokov went by the hacker handle &#8220;<strong>proforg</strong>.&#8221; This nickname corresponds to the administrator of a 20-year-old Russian language forum dedicated to nudity and crudity called &#8220;<strong>udaff</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Besciokov and Mira Serda are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. Besciokov is also charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the International Economic Emergency Powers Act—which also carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in person—and with conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In September 2023, KrebsOnSecurity published findings from security researchers who concluded that a series of six-figure cyberheists across dozens of victims resulted from thieves cracking master passwords stolen from the password manager service <strong>LastPass</strong> in 2022. In a court filing this week, U.S. federal agents investigating a spectacular $150 million cryptocurrency heist said they had reached the same conclusion.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-31264" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/lastpass-580x132.png" alt="" width="580" height="132" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/lastpass-580x132.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/lastpass.png 808w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></p>
<p>On March 6, federal prosecutors in northern California said they seized approximately $24 million worth of cryptocurrencies that were clawed back following a $150 million cyberheist on Jan. 30, 2024. The complaint refers to the person robbed only as &#8220;Victim-1,&#8221; but according to blockchain security researcher <strong>ZachXBT</strong> the theft was perpetrated against <strong>Chris Larsen</strong>, the co-founder of the cryptocurrency platform <strong>Ripple</strong>. ZachXBT was the <a href="https://x.com/zachxbt/status/1752694489905528943" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first to report on the heist</a>.</p>
<p>This week&#8217;s action by the government merely allows investigators to officially seize the frozen funds. But there is an important conclusion in this seizure document: It basically says the <strong>U.S. Secret Service</strong> and the <strong>FBI</strong> agree with the findings of <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/09/experts-fear-crooks-are-cracking-keys-stolen-in-lastpass-breach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the LastPass breach story published here in September 2023</a>.</p>
<p>That piece quoted security researchers who said they were witnessing six-figure crypto heists several times each month that all appeared to be the result of crooks cracking master passwords for the password vaults stolen from LastPass in 2022.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Federal Bureau of Investigation has been investigating these data breaches, and law enforcement agents investigating the instant case have spoken with FBI agents about their investigation,&#8221; reads the seizure complaint, which was written by a U.S. Secret Service agent. &#8220;From those conversations, law enforcement agents in this case learned that the stolen data and passwords that were stored in several victims’ online password manager accounts were used to illegally, and without authorization, access the victims’ electronic accounts and steal information, cryptocurrency, and other data.&#8221;</p>
<p>The document continues:</p>
<p>&#8220;Based on this investigation, law enforcement had probable cause to believe the same attackers behind the above-described commercial online password manager attack used a stolen password held in Victim 1’s online password manager account and, without authorization, accessed his cryptocurrency wallet/account.&#8221;</p>
<p>Working with dozens of victims, security researchers <strong>Nick Bax</strong> and <strong>Taylor Monahan</strong> found that none of the six-figure cyberheist victims appeared to have suffered the sorts of attacks that typically preface a high-dollar crypto theft, such as the compromise of one’s email and/or mobile phone accounts, or SIM-swapping attacks.</p>
<p>They discovered the victims all had something else in common: Each had at one point stored their cryptocurrency seed phrase &#8212; the secret code that lets anyone gain access to your cryptocurrency holdings &#8212; in the &#8220;Secure Notes&#8221; area of their LastPass account prior to the 2022 breaches at the company.</p>
<p>Bax and Monahan found another common theme with these robberies: They all followed a similar pattern of cashing out, rapidly moving stolen funds to a dizzying number of drop accounts scattered across various cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>
<p>According to the government, a similar level of complexity was present in the $150 million heist against the Ripple co-founder last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;The scale of a theft and rapid dissipation of funds would have required the efforts of multiple malicious actors, and was consistent with the online password manager breaches and attack on other victims whose cryptocurrency was stolen,&#8221; the government wrote. &#8220;For these reasons, law enforcement agents believe the cryptocurrency stolen from Victim 1 was committed by the same attackers who conducted the attack on the online password manager, and cryptocurrency thefts from other similarly situated victims.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reached for comment, LastPass said it has seen no definitive proof &#8212; from federal investigators or others &#8212; that the cyberheists in question were linked to the LastPass breaches.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since we initially disclosed this incident back in 2022, LastPass has worked in close cooperation with multiple representatives from law enforcement,&#8221; LastPass said in a written statement. &#8220;To date, our law enforcement partners have not made us aware of any conclusive evidence that connects any crypto thefts to our incident. In the meantime, we have been investing heavily in enhancing our security measures and will continue to do so.&#8221;<span id="more-70634"></span></p>
<p>On August 25, 2022, <strong>LastPass CEO Karim Toubba</strong> told users the company had detected unusual activity in its software development environment, and that the intruders stole some source code and proprietary LastPass technical information. On Sept. 15, 2022, LastPass said an investigation into the August breach determined the attacker did not access any customer data or password vaults.</p>
<p>But on Nov. 30, 2022, LastPass notified customers about another, far more serious security incident that the company said leveraged data stolen in the August breach. LastPass disclosed that criminal hackers had compromised encrypted copies of some password vaults, as well as other personal information.</p>
<p>Experts say the breach would have given thieves &#8220;offline&#8221; access to encrypted password vaults, theoretically allowing them all the time in the world to try to crack some of the weaker master passwords using powerful systems that can attempt millions of password guesses per second.</p>
<p>Researchers found that many of the cyberheist victims had chosen master passwords with relatively low complexity, and were among LastPass&#8217;s oldest customers. That&#8217;s because legacy LastPass users were more likely to have master passwords that were protected with far fewer &#8220;iterations,&#8221; which refers to the number of times your password is run through the company&#8217;s encryption routines. In general, the more iterations, the longer it takes an offline attacker to crack your master password.</p>
<p>Over the years, LastPass forced new users to pick longer and more complex master passwords, and they increased the number of iterations on multiple occasions by several orders of magnitude. But researchers found strong indications that LastPass never succeeded in upgrading many of its older customers to the newer password requirements and protections.</p>
<p>Asked about LastPass&#8217;s continuing denials, Bax said that after the initial warning in our 2023 story, he naively hoped people would migrate their funds to new cryptocurrency wallets.</p>
<p>&#8220;While some did, the continued thefts underscore how much more needs to be done,&#8221; Bax told KrebsOnSecurity. &#8220;It&#8217;s validating to see the Secret Service and FBI corroborate our findings, but I’d much rather see fewer of these hacks in the first place. ZachXBT and <a href="https://x.com/_SEAL_Org/status/1868805837311074576" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEAL 911 reported yet another wave of thefts</a> as recently as December, showing the threat is still very real.&#8221;</p>
<p>Monahan said LastPass still hasn’t alerted their customers that their secrets—especially those stored in “Secure Notes”—may be at risk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Its been two and a half years since LastPass was first breached [and] hundreds of millions of dollars has been stolen from individuals and companies around the globe,&#8221; Monahan said. &#8220;They could have encouraged users to rotate their credentials. They could’ve prevented millions and millions of dollars from being stolen by these threat actors. But  instead they chose to deny that their customers were are risk and blame the victims instead.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At 49, <strong>Branden Spikes</strong> isn&#8217;t just one of the oldest technologists who has been involved in Elon Musk&#8217;s <strong>Department of Government Efficiency</strong> (DOGE). As the current director of information technology at <strong>X/Twitter</strong> and an early hire at <strong>PayPal</strong>, <strong>Zip2</strong>,<strong> Tesla</strong> and <strong>SpaceX</strong>, Spikes is also among Musk&#8217;s most loyal employees. Here&#8217;s a closer look at this trusted Musk lieutenant, whose Russian ex-wife was once married to Elon&#8217;s cousin.</p>
<div id="attachment_70586" style="width: 601px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-70586" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-70586" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/x-spikes.png" alt="" width="591" height="533" /><p id="caption-attachment-70586" class="wp-caption-text">The profile of Branden Spikes on X.</p></div>
<p>When President Trump took office again in January, he put the world&#8217;s richest man &#8212; Elon Musk &#8212; in charge of the <strong>U.S. Digital Service</strong>, and renamed the organization as DOGE. The group is reportedly staffed by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/27/us/politics/doge-staff-list.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at least 50 technologists</a>, many of whom have ties to Musk&#8217;s companies.</p>
<p>DOGE has been enabling the president&#8217;s ongoing mass layoffs and firings of federal workers, largely by seizing control over computer systems and government data for a multitude of federal agencies, including the Social Security Administration, the Department of Homeland Security, the Office of Personnel Management, and the Treasury Department.</p>
<p>It is difficult to find another person connected to DOGE who has stronger ties to Musk than Branden Spikes. A native of California, Spikes initially teamed up with Musk in 1997 as a lead systems engineer for the software company Zip2, the first major venture for Musk. In 1999, Spikes was hired as director of IT at PayPal, and in 2002 he became just the fourth person hired at SpaceX.</p>
<p>In 2012, Spikes launched <strong>Spikes Security</strong>, a software product that sought to create a compartmentalized or &#8220;sandboxed&#8221; web browser that could insulate the user from malware attacks. A review of spikes.com in the Wayback Machine shows that as far back as 1998, Musk could be seen joining Spikes for team matches in the online games Quake and Quake II. In 2016, Spikes Security was merged with another security suite called Aurionpro, with the combined company renamed Cyberinc.</p>
<div id="attachment_70608" style="width: 758px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-70608" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-70608" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/spikesquake.png" alt="" width="748" height="682" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/spikesquake.png 879w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/spikesquake-768x700.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/spikesquake-782x713.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px" /><p id="caption-attachment-70608" class="wp-caption-text">A snapshot of spikes.com from 1998 shows Elon Musk&#8217;s profile in Spike&#8217;s clan for the games Quake and Quake II.</p></div>
<p>Spikes&#8217;s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandenspikes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn profile</a> says he was appointed head of IT at X in February 2025. And although his name shows up on none of the lists of DOGE employees circulated by various media outlets, multiple sources told KrebsOnSecurity that Spikes was working with DOGE and operates within Musk&#8217;s inner circle of trust.</p>
<p>In a conversation with KrebsOnSecurity, Spikes said he is dedicated to his country and to saving it from what he sees as certain ruin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Myself, I was raised by a southern conservative family in California and I strongly believe in America and her future,&#8221; Spikes said. &#8220;This is why I volunteered for two months in DC recently to help DOGE save us from certain bankruptcy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spikes told KrebsOnSecurity that he recently decided to head back home and focus on his job as director of IT at X.</p>
<p>&#8220;I loved it, but ultimately I did not want to leave my hometown and family back in California,&#8221; Spikes said of his tenure at DOGE. &#8220;After a couple of months it became clear that to continue helping I would need to move to DC and commit a lot more time, so I politely bowed out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prior to founding Spikes Security, Branden Spikes was married to a native Russian woman named <strong>Natalia</strong> whom he&#8217;d met at a destination wedding in South America in 2003.</p>
<p>Branden and Natalia&#8217;s names are both on the registration records for the domain name <strong>orangetearoom[.]com</strong>. This domain, which DomainTools.com says was originally registered by Branden in 2009, is the home of a tax-exempt charity in Los Angeles called the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141221061648/http://www.russiancalifornia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>California Russian Association</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Here is a photo from a 2011 event organized by the California Russian Association, showing Branden and Natalia at one of its &#8220;White Nights&#8221; charity fundraisers:</p>
<div id="attachment_70585" style="width: 759px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-70585" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-70585" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/spikes-heritage.png" alt="" width="749" height="564" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/spikes-heritage.png 777w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/spikes-heritage-768x578.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" /><p id="caption-attachment-70585" class="wp-caption-text">Branden and Natalia Spikes, on left, in 2011. The man on the far right is Ivan Y. Podvalov, a board member of the Kremlin-aligned Congress of Russian Americans (CRA). The man in the center is Feodor Yakimoff, director of operations at the Transib Global Sourcing Group, and chairman of the Russian Imperial Charity Balls, which works in concert with the Russian Heritage Foundation.</p></div>
<p>In 2011, the Spikes couple got divorced, and Natalia changed her last name to Haldeman. That is not her maiden name, which appears to be &#8220;Libina.&#8221; Rather, Natalia acquired the surname Haldeman in 1998, when she married Elon Musk&#8217;s cousin.</p>
<p><strong>Reeve Haldeman</strong> is the son of <strong>Scott Haldeman</strong>, who is the brother of Elon Musk&#8217;s mother, <strong>Maye Musk</strong>. Divorce records show Reeve and Natalia <a href="https://unicourt.com/case/ca-ora2-haldeman-v-haldeman-609208" target="_blank" rel="noopener">officially terminated</a> their marriage in 2007. Reeve Haldeman did not respond to a request for comment.<span id="more-70579"></span></p>
<p>A review of other domain names connected to Natalia Haldeman&#8217;s email address show she has registered more than a dozen domains over the years that are tied to the California Russian Association, and an apparently related entity called the <strong>Russian Heritage Foundation, Inc.</strong>:</p>
<p>russianamericans.org<br />
russianamericanstoday.com<br />

theforafoundation.org<br />
thegoldentearoom.com<br />
therussianheritagefoundation.org<br />

<p>Ms. Haldeman did not respond to requests for comment. Her name and contact information appears in the registration records for these domains dating back to 2010, and <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/452775704 California Russian Foundation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a document</a> published by <em>ProPublica</em> show that by 2016 Natalia Haldeman was appointed CEO of the California Russian Foundation.</p>
<p>The domain name that bears both Branden&#8217;s and Natalia&#8217;s names &#8212; orangetearoom.com &#8212; features photos of Ms. Haldeman at fundraising events for the Russian foundation through 2014. Additional photos of her and many of the same people can be seen through 2023 at another domain she registered in 2010 &#8212; <strong>russianheritagefoundation.com</strong>.</p>
<div id="attachment_70630" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-70630" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-70630" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/haldeman-mayemusk-1.png" alt="" width="750" height="429" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/haldeman-mayemusk-1.png 1258w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/haldeman-mayemusk-1-768x439.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/haldeman-mayemusk-1-782x447.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><p id="caption-attachment-70630" class="wp-caption-text">A photo from Natalia Haldeman&#8217;s Facebook page shows her mother (left) pictured with Maye Musk, Elon Musk&#8217;s mother, in 2022.</p></div>
<p>The photo of Branden and Natalia above is from one such event in 2011 (tied to russianwhitenights.org, another Haldeman domain). The person on the right in that image &#8212; <strong>Ivan Y. Podvalov</strong> &#8212; appears in many fundraising event photos published by the foundation over the past decade. Podvalov is a board member of the <strong>Congress of Russian Americans</strong> (CRA), a nonprofit group that is known for vehemently opposing U.S. financial and legal sanctions against Russia.</p>
<p>Writing for <em>The Insider</em> in 2022, journalist <strong>Diana Fishman</strong> described how the CRA has engaged in outright political lobbying, noting that the organization in June 2014 sent a letter to President Obama and the secretary of the United Nations, calling for an end to the &#8220;large-scale US intervention in Ukraine and the campaign to isolate Russia.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The US military contingents must be withdrawn immediately from the Eastern European region, and NATO&#8217;s enlargement efforts and provocative actions against Russia must cease,” the message read.</p>
<p>The Insider said the CRA director sent another two letters, this time to President Donald Trump, in 2017 and 2018.</p>
<p>&#8220;One was a request not to sign a law expanding sanctions against Russia,&#8221; Fishman <a href="https://theins.ru/en/politics/256825" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>. &#8220;The other regretted the expulsion of 60 Russian diplomats from the United States and urged not to jump to conclusions on Moscow&#8217;s involvement in the poisoning of Sergei Skripal.&#8221;</p>
<p>The nonprofit tracking website CauseIQ.com <a href="https://www.causeiq.com/organizations/russian-heritage-foundation,831537424/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> that The Russian Heritage Foundation, Inc. is now known as <strong>Constellation of Humanity</strong>.</p>
<p>The Russian Heritage Foundation and the California Russian Association both promote the interests of <a href="https://cepa.org/article/an-unorthodox-russian-vision-of-heaven-and-hell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Russian Orthodox Church</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141119232054/http://www.russiancalifornia.org/russian-orthodox-church-orange-county/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This page</a> indexed by Archive.org from russiancalifornia.org shows The California Russian Foundation organized a community effort to establish an Orthodox church in Orange County, Calif.</p>
<p>A press release from the <strong>Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia</strong> (ROCOR) shows that in 2021 the Russian Heritage Foundation <a href="https://www.rocorstudies.org/2021/03/09/russian-heritage-foundation-supports-our-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">donated money</a> to organize a conference for the Russian Orthodox Church in Serbia.</p>
<p>A review of the &#8220;<a href="https://orangetearoom.com/index.php/network/about-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Partners</a>&#8221; listed on the Spikes&#8217; jointly registered domain &#8212; orangetearoom.com &#8212; shows the organization worked with a marketing company called <strong>Russian American Media</strong>. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/03/a-close-up-look-at-the-consumer-data-broker-radaris/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reporting by KrebsOnSecurity last year</a> showed that Russian American Media also partners with the problematic people-search service <strong>Radaris</strong>, which was formed by two native Russian brothers in Massachusetts who have built a fleet of consumer data brokers and Russian affiliate programs.</p>
<p>When asked about his ex-wife&#8217;s history, Spikes said she has a good heart and bears no ill-will toward anyone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I attended several of Natalia&#8217;s social events over the years we were together and can assure you that she&#8217;s got the best intentions with those,&#8221; Spikes told KrebsOnSecurity. &#8220;There&#8217;s no funny business going on. It is just a way for those friendly immigrants to find resources amongst each other to help get settled in and chase the American dream. I mean, they&#8217;re not unlike the immigrants from other countries who come to America and try to find each other and help each other find others who speak the language and share in the building of their businesses here in America.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spikes said his own family roots go back deeply into American history, sharing that his 6th great grandfather was Alexander Hamilton on his mom&#8217;s side, and Jessie James on his dad&#8217;s side.</p>
<p>&#8220;My family roots are about as American as you can get,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve also been entrusted with building and safeguarding Elon&#8217;s companies since 1999 and have a keen eye (as you do) for bad actors, so have enough perspective to tell you that Natalia has no bad blood and that she loves America.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, this perspective comes from someone who has the utmost regard for the interests of the &#8220;special government employee&#8221; Mr. Musk, who has been bragging about tossing entire federal agencies into the &#8220;wood chipper,&#8221; and who recently <a href="https://apnews.com/article/musk-chainsaw-trump-doge-6568e9e0cfc42ad6cdcfd58a409eb312" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wielded an actual chainsaw</a> on stage while referring to it as the &#8220;chainsaw for bureaucracy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Elon&#8217;s intentions are good and you can trust him,&#8221; Spikes assured.</p>
<p>A special note of thanks for research assistance goes to <strong>Jacqueline Sweet</strong>, an independent investigative journalist whose work has been published in The Guardian, Rolling Stone, POLITICO and The Intercept.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most notorious providers of abuse-friendly &#8220;bulletproof&#8221; web hosting for cybercriminals has started routing its operations through networks run by the Russian antivirus and security firm <strong>Kaspersky Lab</strong>, KrebsOnSecurity has learned.</p>
<p>Security experts say the Russia-based service provider <strong>Prospero OOO </strong>(the triple O is the Russian version of &#8220;LLC&#8221;) has long been a persistent source of malicious software, botnet controllers, and <a href="https://urlscan.io/search/#page.asn%3Aas200593" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a torrent of phishing websites</a>. Last year, the French security firm <strong>Intrinsec</strong> <a href="https://www.intrinsec.com/prospero-proton66-tracing-uncovering-the-links-between-bulletproof-networks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detailed</a> Prospero&#8217;s connections to bulletproof services advertised on Russian cybercrime forums under the names <strong>Securehost</strong> and <strong>BEARHOST</strong>.</p>
<div id="attachment_70550" style="width: 759px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-70550" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-70550" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/bearhost.png" alt="" width="749" height="492" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/bearhost.png 902w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/bearhost-768x504.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/bearhost-782x513.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" /><p id="caption-attachment-70550" class="wp-caption-text">The bulletproof hosting provider BEARHOST. This screenshot has been machine-translated from Russian. Image: Ke-la.com.</p></div>
<p>Bulletproof hosts are so named when they earn or cultivate a reputation for ignoring legal demands and abuse complaints. And BEARHOST has been cultivating its reputation since at least 2019.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you need a server for a botnet, for malware, brute, scan, phishing, fakes and any other tasks, please contact us,&#8221; BEARHOST&#8217;s ad on one forum advises. &#8220;We completely ignore all abuses without exception, including SPAMHAUS and other organizations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Intrinsec found Prospero has courted some of Russia&#8217;s nastiest cybercrime groups, hosting control servers for multiple ransomware gangs over the past two years. Intrinsec said its analysis showed Prospero frequently hosts malware operations such as <a href="https://www.reliaquest.com/blog/new-python-socgholish-infection-chain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SocGholish</a> and <a href="https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/threats/gootloader/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GootLoader</a>, which are spread primarily via fake browser updates on hacked websites and often lay the groundwork for more serious cyber intrusions &#8212; including ransomware.</p>
<div id="attachment_70548" style="width: 759px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-70548" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-70548" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/fakeupdates.png" alt="" width="749" height="361" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/fakeupdates.png 1121w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/fakeupdates-768x371.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/fakeupdates-782x377.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" /><p id="caption-attachment-70548" class="wp-caption-text">A fake browser update page pushing mobile malware. Image: Intrinsec.</p></div>
<p>BEARHOST prides itself on the ability to evade blocking by <a href="https://www.spamhaus.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spamhaus</a>, an organization that many Internet service providers around the world rely on to help identify and block sources of malware and spam. Earlier this week, Spamhaus said it <a href="https://www.cidr-report.org/cgi-bin/as-report?as=AS200593" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noticed</a> that Prospero was suddenly connecting to the Internet by routing through networks operated by Kaspersky Lab in Moscow.</p>
<p><strong>Update, March 1, 9:43 a.m. ET:</strong> In a written statement, Kaspersky said it is aware of the public claim about the company allegedly providing services to a &#8220;bulletproof&#8221; web hosting provider. Here is their full statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Kaspersky denies these claims as the company does not work and has never worked with the service provider in question. The routing through networks operated by Kaspersky doesn&#8217;t by default mean provision of the company&#8217;s services, as Kaspersky&#8217;s automatic system (AS) path might appear as a technical prefix in the network of telecom providers the company works with and provides its DDoS services.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kaspersky pays great attention to conducting business ethically and ensuring that its solutions are used for their original purpose of providing cybersecurity protection. The company is currently investigating the situation to inform the company whose network could have served as a transit for a &#8220;bulletproof&#8221; web hosting provider so that the former takes the necessary measures.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Kaspersky began selling antivirus and security software in the United States in 2005, and the company&#8217;s malware researchers have earned accolades from the security community for many important discoveries over the years. But in September 2017, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) barred U.S. federal agencies from using Kaspersky software, mandating its removal within 90 days.<span id="more-70525"></span></p>
<p>Cybersecurity reporter <strong>Kim Zetter</strong> notes that DHS didn&#8217;t cite any specific justification for its ban in 2017, but media reports quoting anonymous government officials referenced two incidents. Zetter wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>According to one story, an NSA contractor developing offensive hacking tools for the spy agency had Kaspersky software installed on his home computer where he was developing the tools, and the software detected the source code as malicious code and extracted it from his computer, as antivirus software is designed to do. A second story claimed that Israeli spies caught Russian government hackers using Kaspersky software to search customer systems for files containing U.S. secrets.</p>
<p>Kaspersky denied that anyone used its software to search for secret information on customer machines and said that the tools on the NSA worker&#8217;s machine were detected in the same way that all antivirus software detects files it deems suspicious and then quarantines or extracts them for analysis. Once Kaspersky discovered that the code its antivirus software detected on the NSA worker&#8217;s machine were not malicious programs but source code in development by the U.S. government for its hacking operations, CEO Eugene Kaspersky says he ordered workers to delete the code.</p></blockquote>
<p>Last year, the U.S. Commerce Department <a href="https://www.zetter-zeroday.com/kaspersky-lab-closing-u-s-division-laying-off-workers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banned the sale of Kaspersky software in the U.S.</a> effective July 20, 2024. U.S. officials argued the ban was needed because Russian law requires domestic companies to cooperate in all official investigations, and thus the Russian government could force Kaspersky to secretly gather intelligence on its behalf.</p>
<p>Phishing data gathered last year by the <strong>Interisle Consulting Group</strong> ranked hosting networks by their size and concentration of spambot hosts, and <a href="https://www.cybercrimeinfocenter.org/spam-activity-in-hosting-networks-december-february-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> Prospero had a higher spam score than any other provider by far.</p>

Image: cidr-report.org.</p></div>
<p>It remains unclear why Kaspersky is providing transit to Prospero. <strong>Doug Madory</strong>, director of Internet analysis at <strong>Kentik</strong>, said routing records show the relationship between Prospero and Kaspersky started at the beginning of December 2024.</p>
<p>Madory said Kaspersky&#8217;s network appears to be <a href="https://www.cidr-report.org/cgi-bin/as-report?as=AS209030&amp;v=4&amp;view=2.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hosting several financial institutions</a>, including Russia&#8217;s largest &#8212; <strong>Alfa-Bank</strong>. Kaspersky sells services to help protect customers from distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and Madory said it could be that Prospero is simply purchasing that protection from Kaspersky.</p>
<p>But if that is the case, it doesn&#8217;t make the situation any better, said <strong>Zach Edwards</strong>, a senior threat researcher at the security firm <strong>Silent Push</strong>.</p>
<p>&#8220;In some ways, providing DDoS protection to a well-known bulletproof hosting provider may be even worse than just allowing them to connect to the rest of the Internet over your infrastructure,&#8221; Edwards said.</p>

<p><strong>Cameron John Wagenius</strong>, 21, was <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/12/u-s-army-soldier-arrested-in-att-verizon-extortions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arrested</a> near the Army base in Fort Cavazos, Texas on Dec. 20, and charged with two criminal counts of unlawful transfer of confidential phone records. Wagenius was a communications specialist at a U.S. Army base in South Korea, who secretly went by the nickname <strong>Kiberphant0m</strong> and was part of a trio of criminal hackers that extorted dozens of companies last year over stolen data.</p>
<p>At the end of 2023, malicious hackers learned that many companies had uploaded sensitive customer records to accounts at the cloud data storage service <strong>Snowflake</strong> that were protected with little more than a username and password (no multi-factor authentication needed). After scouring darknet markets for stolen Snowflake account credentials, the hackers began raiding the data storage repositories used by some of the world&#8217;s largest corporations.</p>
<p>Among those was <strong>AT&amp;T</strong>, which disclosed in July that cybercriminals had stolen personal information and phone and text message records for roughly 110 million people — nearly all of its customers. AT&amp;T <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/atandt-paid-hacker-300000-to-delete-stolen-call-records/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly</a> paid a hacker $370,000 to delete stolen phone records. More than 160 other Snowflake customers were relieved of data, including TicketMaster, Lending Tree, Advance Auto Parts and Neiman Marcus.</p>
<p>In several posts to an English-language cybercrime forum in November, Kiberphant0m leaked some of the phone records and threatened to leak them all unless paid a ransom. Prosecutors said that in addition to his public posts on the forum, Wagenius had engaged in multiple direct attempts to extort &#8220;Victim-1,&#8221; which appears to be a reference to AT&amp;T. The government states that Kiberphant0m privately demanded $500,000 from Victim-1, threatening to release all of the stolen phone records unless he was paid.</p>
<p>On Feb. 19, Wagenius <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.343000/gov.uscourts.wawd.343000.27.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pleaded guilty</a> to two counts of unlawfully transferring confidential phone records, but he did so without the benefit of a plea agreement. In entering the plea, Wagenius&#8217;s attorneys had asked the court to allow him to stay with his father pending his sentencing.</p>
<p>But in <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.343000/gov.uscourts.wawd.343000.30.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a response filed today</a> (PDF), prosecutors in Seattle said Wagenius was a flight risk, partly because prior to his arrest he was searching online for how to defect to countries that do not extradite to the United States. According to the government, while Kiberphant0m was extorting AT&amp;T, Wagenius&#8217;s searches included:</p>
<p>-&#8220;where can i defect the u.s government military which country will not hand me over&#8221;<br />
-&#8220;U.S. military personnel defecting to Russia&#8221;<br />
-&#8220;Embassy of Russia – Washington, D.C.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As discussed in the government’s sealed filing, the government has uncovered evidence suggesting that the charged conduct was only a small part of Wagenius’ malicious activity,&#8221; the government memo states. &#8220;On top of this, for more than two weeks in November 2024, Wagenius communicated with an email address he believed belonged to Country-1’s military intelligence service in an attempt to sell stolen information. Days after he apparently finished communicating with Country-1’s military intelligence service, Wagenius Googled, &#8216;can hacking be treason.'&#8221;<span id="more-70530"></span></p>
<p>Prosecutors told the court investigators also found a screenshot on Wagenius&#8217; laptop that suggested he had over 17,000 files that included passports, driver’s licenses, and other identity cards belonging to victims of a breach, and that in one of his online accounts, the government also found a fake identification document that contained his picture.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wagenius should also be detained because he presents a serious risk of flight, has the means and intent to flee, and is aware that he will likely face additional charges,&#8221; the Seattle prosecutors asserted.</p>
<p>The court filing says Wagenius is presently in the process of being separated from the Army, but the government has not received confirmation that his discharge has been finalized.</p>
<p>&#8220;The government’s understanding is that, until his discharge from the Army is finalized (which is expected to happen in early March), he may only be released directly to the Army,&#8221; reads a footnote in the memo. &#8220;Until that process is completed, Wagenius’ proposed release to his father should be rejected for this additional reason.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wagenius&#8217;s interest in defecting to another country in order to escape prosecution mirrors that of his alleged co-conspirator, <strong>John Erin Binns</strong>, an 25-year-old elusive American man indicted by the Justice Department for <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/08/t-mobile-investigating-claims-of-massive-data-breach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 2021 breach at T-Mobile</a> that exposed the personal information of at least 76.6 million customers.</p>
<p>Binns has since been charged with the Snowflake hack and subsequent extortion activity. He is currently in custody in a Turkish prison. Sources close to the investigation told KrebsOnSecurity that prior to his arrest by Turkish police, Binns visited the Russian embassy in Turkey to inquire about Russian citizenship.</p>
<p>In late November 2024, Canadian authorities <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/11/canadian-man-arrested-in-snowflake-data-extortions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arrested a third alleged member of the extortion conspiracy</a>, 25-year-old <strong>Connor Riley Moucka</strong> of Kitchener, Ontario. The U.S. government has indicted Moucka and Binns, charging them with one count of conspiracy; 10 counts of wire fraud; four counts of computer fraud and abuse; two counts of extortion in relation to computer fraud; and two counts aggravated identity theft.</p>
<p>Less than a month before Wagenius&#8217;s arrest, KrebsOnSecurity published <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/11/hacker-in-snowflake-extortions-may-be-a-u-s-soldier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a deep dive</a> into Kiberphant0m&#8217;s various Telegram and Discord identities over the years, revealing how the owner of the accounts told others they were in the Army and stationed in South Korea.</p>
<p>The maximum penalty Wagenius could face at sentencing includes up to ten years in prison for each count, and fines not to exceed $250,000.</p>
