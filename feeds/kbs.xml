										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A whistleblower at the <strong>National Labor Relations Board</strong> (NLRB) alleged last week that denizens of Elon Musk&#8217;s <strong>Department of Government Efficiency</strong> (DOGE) siphoned gigabytes of data from the agency&#8217;s sensitive case files in early March. The whistleblower said accounts created for DOGE at the NLRB downloaded three code repositories from <strong>GitHub</strong>. Further investigation into one of those code bundles shows it is remarkably similar to a program published in January 2025 by <strong>Marko Elez</strong>, a 25-year-old DOGE employee who has worked at a number of Musk&#8217;s companies.</p>
<div id="attachment_71090" style="width: 758px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/db-powershellcmds.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71090" decoding="async" class="wp-image-71090" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/db-powershellcmds.png" alt="" width="748" height="323" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/db-powershellcmds.png 1287w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/db-powershellcmds-768x331.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/db-powershellcmds-782x337.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-71090" class="wp-caption-text">A screenshot shared by NLRB whistleblower Daniel Berulis shows three downloads from GitHub.</p></div>
<p>According to <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/04/whistleblower-doge-siphoned-nlrb-case-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a whistleblower complaint</a> filed last week by <strong>Daniel J. Berulis</strong>, a 38-year-old security architect at the NLRB, officials from DOGE met with NLRB leaders on March 3 and demanded the creation of several all-powerful “tenant admin” accounts that were to be exempted from network logging activity that would otherwise keep a detailed record of all actions taken by those accounts.</p>
<p>Berulis said the new DOGE accounts had unrestricted permission to read, copy, and alter information contained in NLRB databases. The new accounts also could restrict log visibility, delay retention, route logs elsewhere, or even remove them entirely — top-tier user privileges that neither Berulis nor his boss possessed.</p>
<p>Berulis said he discovered one of the DOGE accounts had downloaded three external code libraries from <strong>GitHub</strong> that neither NLRB nor its contractors ever used. A “readme” file in one of the code bundles explained it was created to rotate connections through a large pool of cloud Internet addresses that serve “<em>as a proxy to generate pseudo-infinite IPs for web scraping and brute forcing</em>.” Brute force attacks involve automated login attempts that try many credential combinations in rapid sequence.</p>
<p>A search on that description in Google brings up a code repository at GitHub for a user with the account name &#8220;<strong>Ge0rg3</strong>&#8221; who published a program roughly four years ago called &#8220;<a href="https://github.com/Ge0rg3/requests-ip-rotator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requests-ip-rotator</a>,&#8221; described as a library that will allow the user &#8220;to bypass IP-based rate-limits for sites and services.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_71091" style="width: 759px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71091" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-71091" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ge0rge-gh.png" alt="" width="749" height="543" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ge0rge-gh.png 1171w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ge0rge-gh-768x557.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ge0rge-gh-782x568.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" /><p id="caption-attachment-71091" class="wp-caption-text">The README file from the GitHub user Ge0rg3&#8217;s page for requests-ip-rotator includes the exact wording of a program the whistleblower said was downloaded by one of the DOGE users.

<p>&#8220;A Python library to utilize AWS API Gateway&#8217;s large IP pool as a proxy to generate pseudo-infinite IPs for web scraping and brute forcing,&#8221; the description reads.</p>
<p>Ge0rg3&#8217;s code is &#8220;open source,&#8221; in that anyone can copy it and reuse it non-commercially. As it happens, there is a newer version of this project that was derived or &#8220;forked&#8221; from Ge0rg3&#8217;s code &#8212; called &#8220;<a href="https://github.com/markoelez/async-ip-rotator/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">async-ip-rotator</a>&#8221; &#8212; and it was committed to GitHub in January 2025 by DOGE captain <a href="https://github.com/markoelez" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marko Elez</a>.</p>

<p>A key DOGE staff member who gained access to the Treasury Department&#8217;s central payments system, Elez has worked for a number of Musk companies, including <strong>X</strong>, <strong>SpaceX</strong>, and <strong>xAI</strong>. Elez was among the first DOGE employees to face public scrutiny, after <strong>The Wall Street Journal</strong> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/doge-staffer-resigns-over-racist-posts-d9f11a93" target="_blank" rel="noopener">linked him to social media posts</a> that advocated racism and eugenics.</p>
<p>Elez resigned after that brief scandal, but was rehired after President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance expressed support for him. <strong>Politico</strong> <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/29/doge-marco-elez-software-engineer-us-payroll-00259303" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> Elez is now a <strong>Labor Department</strong> aide detailed to multiple agencies, including the <strong>Department of Health and Human Services</strong>.</p>
<p>&#8220;During Elez’s initial stint at Treasury, he violated the agency’s information security policies by sending a spreadsheet containing names and payments information to officials at the General Services Administration,&#8221; Politico wrote, citing court filings.</p>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity sought comment from both the NLRB and DOGE, and will update this story if either responds.<span id="more-71075"></span></p>
<p>The NLRB has been effectively hobbled since <strong>President Trump</strong> fired three board members, leaving the agency without the quorum it needs to function. Both <strong>Amazon</strong> and Musk’s <strong>SpaceX</strong> have <a href="https://apnews.com/article/amazon-nlrb-unconstitutional-spacex-elon-musk-ab42977117d883e97110a7bf8e8b257f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">been suing</a> the NLRB over complaints the agency filed in disputes about workers’ rights and union organizing, arguing that the NLRB’s very existence is unconstitutional. On March 5, a U.S. appeals court <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/musks-spacex-loses-early-legal-challenge-us-labor-boards-powers-2025-03-05/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unanimously rejected</a> Musk’s claim that the NLRB’s structure somehow violates the Constitution.</p>
<p>Berulis&#8217;s complaint alleges the DOGE accounts at NLRB downloaded more than 10 gigabytes of data from the agency&#8217;s case files, a database that includes reams of sensitive records including information about employees who want to form unions and proprietary business documents. Berulis said he went public after higher-ups at the agency told him not to report the matter to the US-CERT, as they&#8217;d previously agreed.</p>
<p>Berulis told KrebsOnSecurity he worried the unauthorized data transfer by DOGE could unfairly advantage defendants in a number of ongoing labor disputes before the agency.</p>
<p>&#8220;If any company got the case data that would be an unfair advantage,&#8221; Berulis said. &#8220;They could identify and fire employees and union organizers without saying why.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_71106" style="width: 454px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71106" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-71106" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/markoelez.png" alt="" width="444" height="515" /><p id="caption-attachment-71106" class="wp-caption-text">Marko Elez, in a photo from a social media profile.</p></div>
<p>Berulis said the other two GitHub archives that DOGE employees downloaded to NLRB systems included <strong>Integuru</strong>, a software framework designed to reverse engineer application programming interfaces (APIs) that websites use to fetch data; and a &#8220;headless&#8221; browser called <strong>Browserless</strong>, which is made for automating web-based tasks that require a pool of browsers, such as web scraping and automated testing.</p>
<p>On February 6, someone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250423135719/https://github.com/markoelez/async-ip-rotator/issues/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted a lengthy and detailed critique</a> of Elez&#8217;s code on the GitHub &#8220;issues&#8221; page for async-ip-rotator, calling it &#8220;insecure, unscalable and a fundamental engineering failure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If this were a side project, it would just be bad code,&#8221; the reviewer wrote. &#8220;But if this is representative of how you build production systems, then there are much larger concerns. This implementation is fundamentally broken, and if anything similar to this is deployed in an environment handling sensitive data, it should be audited immediately.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Update 7:06 p.m. ET</strong>: Elez&#8217;s code repo was deleted after this story was published. An archived version of it <a href="https://github.com/ricci/async-ip-rotator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A security architect with the <strong>National Labor Relations Board</strong> (NLRB) alleges that employees from <strong>Elon Musk</strong>&#8216;s <strong>Department of Government Efficiency</strong> (DOGE) transferred gigabytes of sensitive data from agency case files in early March, using short-lived accounts configured to leave few traces of network activity. The NLRB whistleblower said the unusual large data outflows coincided with multiple blocked login attempts from an Internet address in Russia that tried to use valid credentials for a newly-created DOGE user account.</p>
<div id="attachment_71048" style="width: 759px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71048" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-71048" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/beruliscomplaint.png" alt="" width="749" height="823" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/beruliscomplaint.png 786w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/beruliscomplaint-768x844.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/beruliscomplaint-782x860.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" /><p id="caption-attachment-71048" class="wp-caption-text">The cover letter from Berulis&#8217;s whistleblower statement, sent to the leaders of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.</p></div>
<p>The allegations came in an April 14 letter to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, signed by <strong>Daniel J. Berulis</strong>, a 38-year-old security architect at the NLRB.</p>
<p><strong>NPR</strong>, which was the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/15/nx-s1-5355896/doge-nlrb-elon-musk-spacex-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first to report</a> on Berulis&#8217;s whistleblower complaint, says NLRB is a small, independent federal agency that investigates and adjudicates complaints about unfair labor practices, and stores &#8220;reams of potentially sensitive data, from confidential information about employees who want to form unions to proprietary business information.&#8221;</p>
<p>The complaint documents a one-month period beginning March 3, during which DOGE officials reportedly demanded the creation of all-powerful &#8220;tenant admin&#8221; accounts in NLRB systems that were to be exempted from network logging activity that would otherwise keep a detailed record of all actions taken by those accounts.</p>
<p>Berulis said the new DOGE accounts had unrestricted permission to read, copy, and alter information contained in NLRB databases. The new accounts also could restrict log visibility, delay retention, route logs elsewhere, or even remove them entirely &#8212; top-tier user privileges that neither Berulis nor his boss possessed.</p>
<p>Berulis writes that on March 3, a black SUV accompanied by a police escort arrived at his building &#8212; the NLRB headquarters in Southeast Washington, D.C. The DOGE staffers did not speak with Berulis or anyone else in NLRB&#8217;s IT staff, but instead met with the agency leadership.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our acting chief information officer told us not to adhere to standard operating procedure with the DOGE account creation, and there was to be no logs or records made of the accounts created for DOGE employees, who required the highest level of access,&#8221; Berulis wrote of their instructions after that meeting.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have built in roles that auditors can use and have used extensively in the past but would not give the ability to make changes or access subsystems without approval,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;The suggestion that they use these accounts was not open to discussion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Berulis found that on March 3 one of the DOGE accounts created an opaque, virtual environment known as a &#8220;container,&#8221; which can be used to build and run programs or scripts without revealing its activities to the rest of the world. Berulis said the container caught his attention because he polled his colleagues and found none of them had ever used containers within the NLRB network.</p>
<p>Berulis said he also noticed that early the next morning &#8212; between approximately 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. EST on Tuesday, March 4  &#8212; there was a large increase in outgoing traffic from the agency. He said it took several days of investigating with his colleagues to determine that one of the new accounts had transferred approximately 10 gigabytes worth of data from the NLRB&#8217;s <strong>NxGen</strong> case management system.</p>
<p>Berulis said neither he nor his co-workers had the necessary network access rights to review which files were touched or transferred &#8212; or even where they went. But his complaint notes the NxGen database contains sensitive information on unions, ongoing legal cases, and corporate secrets.</p>
<p>&#8220;I also don’t know if the data was only 10gb in total or whether or not they were consolidated and compressed prior,&#8221; Berulis told the senators. &#8220;This opens up the possibility that even more data was exfiltrated. Regardless, that kind of spike is extremely unusual because data almost never directly leaves NLRB’s databases.&#8221;</p>
<p>Berulis said he and his colleagues grew even more alarmed when they noticed nearly two dozen login attempts from a Russian Internet address (83.149.30,186) that presented valid login credentials for a DOGE employee account &#8212; one that had been created just minutes earlier. Berulis said those attempts were all blocked thanks to rules in place that prohibit logins from non-U.S. locations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoever was attempting to log in was using one of the newly created accounts that were used in the other DOGE related activities and it appeared they had the correct username and password due to the authentication flow only stopping them due to our no-out-of-country logins policy activating,&#8221; Berulis wrote. &#8220;There were more than 20 such attempts, and what is particularly concerning is that many of these login attempts occurred within 15 minutes of the accounts being created by DOGE engineers.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Berulis, the naming structure of one Microsoft user account connected to the suspicious activity suggested it had been created and later deleted for DOGE use in the NLRB&#8217;s cloud systems: &#8220;<strong>DogeSA_2d5c3e0446f9@nlrb.microsoft.com</strong>.&#8221; He also found other new Microsoft cloud administrator accounts with nonstandard usernames, including &#8220;<strong>Whitesox, Chicago M.</strong>&#8221; and &#8220;<strong>Dancehall, Jamaica R</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_71042" style="width: 759px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/whitesoxchicago.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71042" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-71042" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/whitesoxchicago.png" alt="" width="749" height="556" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/whitesoxchicago.png 1072w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/whitesoxchicago-768x570.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/whitesoxchicago-782x581.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-71042" class="wp-caption-text">A screenshot shared by Berulis showing the suspicious user accounts.</p></div>
<p>On March 5, Berulis documented that a large section of logs for recently created network resources were missing, and a network watcher in <strong>Microsoft Azure</strong> was set to the &#8220;off&#8221; state, meaning it was no longer collecting and recording data like it should have.</p>
<p>Berulis said he discovered someone had downloaded three external code libraries from <strong>GitHub</strong> that neither NLRB nor its contractors ever use. A &#8220;readme&#8221; file in one of the code bundles explained it was created to rotate connections through a large pool of cloud Internet addresses that serve &#8220;as a proxy to generate pseudo-infinite IPs for web scraping and brute forcing.&#8221; Brute force attacks involve automated login attempts that try many credential combinations in rapid sequence.</p>
<p>The complaint alleges that by March 17 it became clear the NLRB no longer had the resources or network access needed to fully investigate the odd activity from the DOGE accounts, and that on March 24, the agency&#8217;s associate chief information officer had agreed the matter should be reported to <strong>US-CERT</strong>. Operated by the Department of Homeland Security&#8217;s <strong>Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency</strong> (CISA), US-CERT provides on-site cyber incident response capabilities to federal and state agencies.</p>
<p>But Berulis said that between April 3 and 4, he and the associate CIO were informed that &#8220;instructions had come down to drop the US-CERT reporting and investigation and we were directed not to move forward or create an official report.&#8221; Berulis said it was at this point he decided to go public with his findings.<span id="more-71035"></span></p>
<div id="attachment_71050" style="width: 695px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/berulis-mar4-spike.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71050" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-71050 size-full" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/berulis-mar4-spike.png" alt="" width="685" height="908" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-71050" class="wp-caption-text">An email from Daniel Berulis to his colleagues dated March 28, referencing the unexplained traffic spike earlier in the month and the unauthorized changing of security controls for user accounts.</p></div>
<p><strong>Tim Bearese</strong>, the NLRB&#8217;s acting press secretary, told NPR that DOGE neither requested nor received access to its systems, and that &#8220;the agency conducted an investigation after Berulis raised his concerns but &#8216;determined that no breach of agency systems occurred.'&#8221; The NLRB did not respond to questions from KrebsOnSecurity.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Berulis has shared a number of supporting screenshots showing agency email discussions about the unexplained account activity attributed to the DOGE accounts, as well as NLRB security alerts from Microsoft about network anomalies observed during the timeframes described.</p>
<p>As <strong>CNN</strong> <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/15/business/nlrb-trump-musk-workers/index.html#:~:text=Musk's%20SpaceX%20brought%20a%20case,it%20for%20firing%20some%20employees." target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> last month, the NLRB has been effectively hobbled since <strong>President Trump</strong> fired three board members, leaving the agency without the quorum it needs to function.</p>
<p>&#8220;Despite its limitations, the agency had become a thorn in the side of some of the richest and most powerful people in the nation — notably Elon Musk, Trump’s key supporter both financially and arguably politically,&#8221; CNN wrote.</p>
<p>Both <strong>Amazon</strong> and Musk&#8217;s <strong>SpaceX</strong> have <a href="https://apnews.com/article/amazon-nlrb-unconstitutional-spacex-elon-musk-ab42977117d883e97110a7bf8e8b257f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">been suing</a> the NLRB over complaints the agency filed in disputes about workers&#8217; rights and union organizing, arguing that the NLRB&#8217;s very existence is unconstitutional. On March 5, a U.S. appeals court <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/musks-spacex-loses-early-legal-challenge-us-labor-boards-powers-2025-03-05/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unanimously rejected</a> Musk&#8217;s claim that the NLRB&#8217;s structure somehow violates the Constitution.</p>
<p>Berulis shared screenshots with KrebsOnSecurity showing that on the day the NPR published its story about his claims (April 14), the deputy CIO at NLRB sent an email stating that administrative control had been removed from all employee accounts. Meaning, suddenly none of the IT employees at the agency could do their jobs properly anymore, Berulis said.</p>

<p>Berulis shared a screenshot of an agency-wide email dated April 16 from NLRB director <strong>Lasharn Hamilton</strong> saying DOGE officials had requested a meeting, and reiterating claims that the agency had no prior &#8220;official&#8221; contact with any DOGE personnel. The message informed NLRB employees that two DOGE representatives would be detailed to the agency part-time for several months.</p>
<div id="attachment_71041" style="width: 561px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71041" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-71041" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/nlrb-dir-emailapril14.png" alt="" width="551" height="568" /><p id="caption-attachment-71041" class="wp-caption-text">An email from the NLRB Director Lasharn Hamilton on April 16, stating that the agency previously had no contact with DOGE personnel.</p></div>
<p>Berulis told KrebsOnSecurity he was in the process of filing a support ticket with Microsoft to request more information about the DOGE accounts when his network administrator access was restricted. Now, he&#8217;s hoping lawmakers will ask Microsoft to provide more information about what really happened with the accounts.</p>
<p>&#8220;That would give us way more insight,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Microsoft has to be able to see the picture better than we can. That&#8217;s my goal, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>Berulis&#8217;s attorney told lawmakers that on April 7, while his client and legal team were preparing the whistleblower complaint, someone physically taped a threatening note to Mr. Berulis&#8217;s home door with photographs &#8212; taken via drone &#8212; of him walking in his neighborhood.</p>
<p>&#8220;The threatening note made clear reference to this very disclosure he was preparing for you, as the proper oversight authority,&#8221; reads a preface by Berulis&#8217;s attorney <strong>Andrew P. Bakaj</strong>. &#8220;While we do not know specifically who did this, we can only speculate that it involved someone with the ability to access NLRB systems.&#8221;</p>
<p>Berulis said the response from friends, colleagues and even the public has been largely supportive, and that he doesn&#8217;t regret his decision to come forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t expect the letter on my door or the pushback from [agency] leaders,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If I had to do it over, would I do it again? Yes, because it wasn&#8217;t really even a choice the first time.&#8221;</p>
<p>For now, Mr. Berulis is taking some paid family leave from the NLRB. Which is just as well, he said, considering he was stripped of the tools needed to do his job at the agency.</p>
<p>&#8220;They came in and took full administrative control and locked everyone out, and said limited permission will be assigned on a need basis going forward&#8221; Berulis said of the DOGE employees. &#8220;We can&#8217;t really do anything, so we&#8217;re literally getting paid to count ceiling tiles.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A critical resource that cybersecurity professionals worldwide rely on to identify, mitigate and fix security vulnerabilities in software and hardware is in danger of breaking down. The federally funded, non-profit research and development organization <strong>MITRE</strong> warned today that its contract to maintain the <strong>Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures</strong> (CVE) program &#8212; which is traditionally funded each year by the Department of Homeland Security &#8212; expires on April 16.</p>
<div id="attachment_71016" style="width: 752px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71016" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-71016" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mitreletter.png" alt="" width="742" height="942" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mitreletter.png 788w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mitreletter-768x975.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mitreletter-782x992.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 742px) 100vw, 742px" /><p id="caption-attachment-71016" class="wp-caption-text">A letter from MITRE vice president Yosry Barsoum, warning that the funding for the CVE program will expire on April 16, 2025.</p></div>
<p>Tens of thousands of security flaws in software are found and reported every year, and these vulnerabilities are eventually assigned their own unique CVE tracking number (e.g. <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-43573" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2024-43573</a>, which is a <strong>Microsoft Windows</strong> bug that Redmond patched last year).</p>
<p>There are hundreds of organizations &#8212; known as <strong>CVE Numbering Authorities</strong> (CNAs) &#8212; that are authorized by MITRE to bestow these CVE numbers on newly reported flaws. Many of these CNAs are country and government-specific, or tied to individual software vendors or vulnerability disclosure platforms (a.k.a. bug bounty programs).</p>
<p>Put simply, MITRE is a critical, widely-used resource for centralizing and standardizing information on software vulnerabilities. That means the pipeline of information it supplies is plugged into an array of cybersecurity tools and services that help organizations identify and patch security holes &#8212; ideally before malware or malcontents can wriggle through them.</p>
<p>&#8220;What the CVE lists really provide is a standardized way to describe the severity of that defect, and a centralized repository listing which versions of which products are defective and need to be updated,&#8221; said <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/contributors/mtait" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matt Tait</a>, chief operating officer of <strong>Corellium</strong>, a cybersecurity firm that sells phone-virtualization software for finding security flaws.</p>
<p>In a letter sent today to the CVE board, MITRE Vice President <strong>Yosry Barsoum </strong>warned that on April 16, 2025, &#8220;the current contracting pathway for MITRE to develop, operate and modernize CVE and several other related programs will expire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If a break in service were to occur, we anticipate multiple impacts to CVE, including deterioration of national vulnerability databases and advisories, tool vendors, incident response operations, and all manner of critical infrastructure,&#8221; Barsoum wrote.</p>
<p>MITRE told KrebsOnSecurity the CVE website listing vulnerabilities will remain up after the funding expires, but that new CVEs won&#8217;t be added after April 16.</p>
<div id="attachment_71017" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CVE-Lifecycle.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71017" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-71017" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CVE-Lifecycle.png" alt="" width="750" height="335" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CVE-Lifecycle.png 1926w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CVE-Lifecycle-768x343.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CVE-Lifecycle-1536x686.png 1536w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CVE-Lifecycle-782x349.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-71017" class="wp-caption-text">A representation of how a vulnerability becomes a CVE, and how that information is consumed. Image: James Berthoty, Latio Tech, via LinkedIn.</p></div>
<p>DHS officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The program is funded through DHS&#8217;s <strong>Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency</strong> (CISA), which is currently facing <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/04/trump-revenge-tour-targets-cyber-leaders-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deep budget and staffing cuts by the Trump administration</a>. The <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_70RCSJ24FR0000019_7001_70RSAT20D00000001_7001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE contract</a> available at USAspending.gov says the project was awarded approximately $40 million last year.<br />
<span id="more-71010"></span></p>
<p>Former CISA Director<strong> Jen Easterly</strong> said the CVE program is a bit like the Dewey Decimal System, but for cybersecurity.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s the global catalog that helps everyone—security teams, software vendors, researchers, governments—organize and talk about vulnerabilities using the same reference system,&#8221; Easterly said in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7318021583191617538/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a post on LinkedIn</a>. &#8220;Without it, everyone is using a different catalog or no catalog at all, no one knows if they’re talking about the same problem, defenders waste precious time figuring out what’s wrong, and worst of all, threat actors take advantage of the confusion.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>John Hammond</strong>, principal security researcher at the managed security firm <strong>Huntress</strong>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-funding-running-out-critical-cyber-vulnerability-database-manager-says-2025-04-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told Reuters</a> he swore out loud when he heard the news that CVE&#8217;s funding was in jeopardy, and that losing the CVE program would be like losing &#8220;the language and lingo we used to address problems in cybersecurity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I really can&#8217;t help but think this is just going to hurt,&#8221; said Hammond, who posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itbsfeqrRY4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Youtube video</a> to vent about the situation and alert others.</p>
<p>Several people close to the matter told KrebsOnSecurity this is not the first time the CVE program&#8217;s budget has been left in funding limbo until the last minute. Barsoum&#8217;s letter, which was apparently leaked, sounded a hopeful note, saying the government is making &#8220;considerable efforts to continue MITRE&#8217;s role in support of the program.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tait said that without the CVE program, risk managers inside companies would need to continuously monitor many other places for information about new vulnerabilities that may jeopardize the security of their IT networks. Meaning, it may become more common that software updates get mis-prioritized, with companies having hackable software deployed for longer than they otherwise would, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hopefully they will resolve this, but otherwise the list will rapidly fall out of date and stop being useful,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><strong>Update, April 16, 11:00 a.m. ET:</strong> The CVE board today announced the creation of non-profit entity called <strong>The CVE Foundation </strong>that will continue the program&#8217;s work under a new, unspecified funding mechanism and organizational structure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since its inception, the CVE Program has operated as a U.S. government-funded initiative, with oversight and management provided under contract,&#8221; the press release reads. &#8220;While this structure has supported the program&#8217;s growth, it has also raised longstanding concerns among members of the CVE Board about the sustainability and neutrality of a globally relied-upon resource being tied to a single government sponsor.&#8221;</p>
<p>The organization&#8217;s website, <a href="https://www.thecvefoundation.org/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thecvefoundation.org</a>, is less than a day old and currently hosts no content other than the press release heralding its creation. The announcement said the foundation would release more information about its structure and transition planning in the coming days.</p>
<p><strong>Update, April 16, 4:26 p.m. ET:</strong> MITRE issued a statement today saying it &#8220;identified incremental funding to keep the programs operational. We appreciate the overwhelming support for these programs that have been expressed by the global cyber community, industry and government over the last 24 hours. The government continues to make considerable efforts to support MITRE&#8217;s role in the program and MITRE remains committed to CVE and CWE as global resources.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>President Trump</strong> last week revoked security clearances for <strong>Chris Krebs</strong>, the former director of the <strong>Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency</strong> (CISA) who was fired by Trump after declaring the 2020 election the most secure in U.S. history. The White House memo, which also suspended clearances for other security professionals at Krebs&#8217;s employer <strong>SentinelOne</strong>, comes as CISA is facing huge funding and staffing cuts.</p>
<div id="attachment_70987" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-70987" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-70987" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/chriskrebs-gi.png" alt="" width="750" height="330" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/chriskrebs-gi.png 883w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/chriskrebs-gi-768x337.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/chriskrebs-gi-782x344.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><p id="caption-attachment-70987" class="wp-caption-text">Chris Krebs. Image: Getty Images.</p></div>
<p>The extraordinary <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-addresses-risks-from-chris-krebs-and-government-censorship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">April 9 memo</a> directs the attorney general to investigate Chris Krebs (no relation), calling him &#8220;a significant bad-faith actor who weaponized and abused his government authority.&#8221;</p>
<p>The memo said the inquiry will include &#8220;a comprehensive evaluation of all of CISA&#8217;s activities over the last 6 years and will identify any instances where Krebs&#8217; or CISA&#8217;s conduct appears to be contrary to the administration’s commitment to free speech and ending federal censorship, including whether Krebs’ conduct was contrary to suitability standards for federal employees or involved the unauthorized dissemination of classified information.&#8221;</p>
<p>CISA was created in 2018 during Trump&#8217;s first term, with Krebs installed as its first director. In 2020, CISA launched Rumor Control, a website that sought to rebut disinformation swirling around the 2020 election.</p>
<p>That effort ran directly counter to Trump&#8217;s claims that he lost the election because it was somehow hacked and stolen. The Trump campaign and its supporters filed at least 62 lawsuits contesting the election, vote counting, and vote certification in nine states, and nearly all of those cases were dismissed or dropped for lack of evidence or standing.</p>
<p>When the Justice Department began prosecuting people who violently attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, President Trump and Republican leaders shifted the narrative, claiming that Trump lost the election because the previous administration had censored conservative voices on social media.</p>
<p>Incredibly, the president&#8217;s memo seeking to ostracize Krebs stands reality on its head, accusing Krebs of promoting the censorship of election information, &#8220;including known risks associated with certain voting practices.&#8221; Trump also alleged that Krebs &#8220;<em>falsely and baselessly denied that the 2020 election was rigged and stolen</em>, including by inappropriately and categorically dismissing widespread election malfeasance and serious vulnerabilities with voting machines&#8221; [emphasis added].</p>
<p>Krebs did not respond to a request for comment. SentinelOne issued <a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/an-official-statement-in-response-to-the-april-9-2025-executive-order/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a statement</a> saying it would cooperate in any review of security clearances held by its personnel, which is currently fewer than 10 employees.</p>
<p>Krebs&#8217;s former agency is now facing steep budget and staff reductions. <strong>The Record</strong> <a href="https://therecord.media/trump-administration-planning-workforce-cuts-at-cisa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> that CISA is looking to remove some 1,300 people by cutting about half its full-time staff and another 40% of its contractors.</p>
<p>&#8220;The agency’s National Risk Management Center, which serves as a hub analyzing risks to cyber and critical infrastructure, is expected to see significant cuts, said two sources familiar with the plans,&#8221; The Record&#8217;s <strong>Suzanne Smalley</strong> wrote. &#8220;Some of the office’s systematic risk responsibilities will potentially be moved to the agency’s Cybersecurity Division, according to one of the sources.&#8221;</p>
<p>CNN <a href="https://archive.ph/InCFx#selection-2323.226-2323.412" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> the Trump administration is also advancing plans to strip civil service protections from 80% of the remaining CISA employees, potentially allowing them to be fired for political reasons.</p>
<p>The <strong>Electronic Frontier Foundation</strong> (EFF) urged professionals in the cybersecurity community to defend Krebs and SentinelOne, noting that other security companies and professionals could be the next victims of Trump&#8217;s efforts to politicize cybersecurity.</p>
<p>&#8220;The White House must not be given free reign to turn cybersecurity professionals into political scapegoats,&#8221; the EFF <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/04/cybersecurity-community-must-not-remain-silent-executive-order-attacking-former" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>. &#8220;It is critical that the cybersecurity community now join together to denounce this chilling attack on free speech and rally behind Krebs and SentinelOne rather than cowering because they fear they will be next.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, <strong>Reuters</strong> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/cybersecurity-industry-falls-silent-trump-turns-ire-sentinelone-2025-04-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> it found little sign of industry support for Krebs or SentinelOne, and that many security professionals are concerned about potentially being targeted if they speak out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reuters contacted 33 of the largest U.S. cybersecurity companies, including tech companies and professional services firms with large cybersecurity practices, and three industry groups, for comment on Trump&#8217;s action against SentinelOne,&#8221; wrote <strong>Raphael Satter</strong> and <strong>A.J. Vicens</strong>. &#8220;Only one offered comment on Trump&#8217;s action. The rest declined, did not respond or did not answer questions.&#8221;</p>
<h2>CYBERCOM-PLICATIONS</h2>
<p>On April 3, President Trump fired <strong>Gen. Timothy Haugh</strong>, the head of the <strong>National Security Agency </strong>(NSA) and the <strong>U.S. Cyber Command</strong>, as well as Haugh&#8217;s deputy, <strong>Wendy Noble</strong>. The president did so immediately after meeting in the Oval Office with far-right conspiracy theorist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Loomer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Laura Loomer</a>, who reportedly urged their dismissal. Speaking to reporters on Air Force One after news of the firings broke, Trump questioned Haugh&#8217;s loyalty.</p>

<p>Virginia <strong>Senator Mark Warner</strong>, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, called it inexplicable that the administration would remove the senior leaders of NSA-CYBERCOM without cause or warning, and risk disrupting critical ongoing intelligence operations.</p>
<p>“It is astonishing, too, that President Trump would fire the nonpartisan, experienced leader of the National Security Agency while still failing to hold any member of his team accountable for leaking classified information on a commercial messaging app – even as he apparently takes staffing direction on national security from a discredited conspiracy theorist in the Oval Office,&#8221; Warner said in a statement.</p>
<p>On Feb. 28, The Record&#8217;s <strong>Martin Matishak</strong> <a href="https://therecord.media/hegseth-orders-cyber-command-stand-down-russia-planning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cited</a> three sources saying Defense Secretary <strong>Pete Hegseth</strong> ordered U.S. Cyber Command to stand down from all planning against Russia, including offensive digital actions. The following day, <strong>The Guardian</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/28/trump-russia-hacking-cyber-security?ref=zetter-zeroday.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that analysts at CISA were verbally informed that they were not to follow or report on Russian threats, even though this had previously been a main focus for the agency.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/03/01/trump-putin-russia-cyber-offense-cisa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">follow-up story</a> from <strong>The Washington Post</strong> cited officials saying Cyber Command had received an order to halt active operations against Russia, but that the pause was intended to last only as long as negotiations with Russia continue.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense responded on Twitter/X that Hegseth had &#8220;neither canceled nor delayed any cyber operations directed against malicious Russian targets and there has been no stand-down order whatsoever from that priority.&#8221;</p>
<p>But on March 19, Reuters <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-us-suspends-efforts-counter-060549726.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> several U.S. national security agencies have halted work on a coordinated effort to counter Russian sabotage, disinformation and cyberattacks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Regular meetings between the National Security Council and European national security officials have gone unscheduled, and the NSC has also stopped formally coordinating efforts across U.S. agencies, including with the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department,&#8221; Reuters reported, citing current and former officials.<span id="more-70970"></span></p>
<h2>TARIFFS VS TYPHOONS</h2>
<p>President&#8217;s Trump&#8217;s institution of 125% tariffs on goods from China has seen Beijing strike back with 84 percent tariffs on U.S. imports. Now, some security experts are warning that the trade war <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/10/trade_war_reaches_cyberspace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could spill over into a cyber conflict</a>, given China&#8217;s successful efforts to burrow into America&#8217;s critical infrastructure networks.</p>
<p>Over the past year, a number of Chinese government-backed digital intrusions have come into focus, including a sprawling espionage campaign involving the compromise of <a href="https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/salt-typhoon-telecom-attacks-lax-security/736233/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at least nine U.S. telecommunications providers</a>. Dubbed &#8220;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/us/politics/salt-typhoon-hack-what-we-know.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Salt Typhoon</a>&#8221; by Microsoft, these telecom intrusions were pervasive enough that CISA and the FBI in December 2024 <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/enhanced-visibility-and-hardening-guidance-communications-infrastructure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">warned Americans</a> against communicating sensitive information over phone networks, urging people instead to use encrypted messaging apps (like Signal).</p>
<p>The other broad ranging China-backed campaign is known as &#8220;<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-038a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Volt Typhoon</a>,&#8221; which CISA described as &#8220;state-sponsored cyber actors seeking to pre-position themselves on IT networks for disruptive or destructive cyberattacks against U.S. critical infrastructure in the event of a major crisis or conflict with the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p>Responsibility for determining the root causes of the Salt Typhoon security debacle fell to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_Safety_Review_Board" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cyber Safety Review Board</a> (CSRB), a nonpartisan government entity established in February 2022 with a mandate to investigate the security failures behind major cybersecurity events. But on his first full day back in the White House, President Trump dismissed all 15 CSRB advisory committee members &#8212; likely because those advisers included Chris Krebs.</p>
<p>Last week, <strong>Sen. Ron Wyden</strong> (D-Ore.) placed a hold on Trump&#8217;s nominee to lead CISA, saying the hold would continue unless the agency published a report on the telecom industry hacks, as promised.</p>
<div class="text__text__1FZLe text__dark-grey__3Ml43 text__regular__2N1Xr text__small__1kGq2 body__full_width__ekUdw body__small_body__2vQyf article-body__paragraph__2-BtD" data-testid="paragraph-6">
<p>&#8220;CISA&#8217;s multi-year cover up of the phone companies&#8217; negligent cybersecurity has real consequences,&#8221; Wyden said in <a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wyden-places-hold-on-top-cybersecurity-nominee-to-force-release-of-important-details-on-security-threats-to-us-phone-networks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a statement</a>. &#8220;Congress and the American people have a right to read this report.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>The Wall Street Journal</strong> reported last week Chinese officials acknowledged in a secret December meeting that Beijing was behind the widespread telecom industry compromises.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Chinese official&#8217;s remarks at the December meeting were indirect and somewhat ambiguous, but most of the American delegation in the room interpreted it as a tacit admission and a warning to the U.S. about Taiwan,&#8221; The Journal&#8217;s <strong>Dustin Volz</strong> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/in-secret-meeting-china-acknowledged-role-in-u-s-infrastructure-hacks-c5ab37cb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>, citing a former U.S. official familiar with the meeting.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, China continues to take advantage of the mass firings of federal workers. On April 9, the <strong>National Counterintelligence and Security Center</strong> <a href="https://www.dni.gov/files/NCSC/documents/products/2025-04-08-NCSC-FBI-DCSA-OnlineTargetingUSGEmployees.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">warned</a> (PDF) that Chinese intelligence entities are pursuing an online effort to recruit recently laid-off U.S. employees.</p>
<p>&#8220;Foreign intelligence entities, particularly those in China, are targeting current and former U.S. government (USG) employees for recruitment by posing as consulting firms, corporate headhunters, think tanks, and other entities on social and professional networking sites,&#8221; the alert warns. &#8220;Their deceptive online job offers, and other virtual approaches, have become more sophisticated in targeting unwitting individuals with USG backgrounds seeking new employment.&#8221;</p>

<h2>ELECTION THREATS</h2>
<p>As Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us-suspends-some-efforts-counter-russian-sabotage-trump-moves-closer-putin-2025-03-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notes</a>, the FBI last month ended an effort to counter interference in U.S. elections by foreign adversaries including Russia, and put on leave staff working on the issue at the Department of Homeland Security.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate is now considering a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/us/politics/house-citizenship-elections-save-act.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House-passed bill</a> dubbed the &#8220;<strong>Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act</strong>,&#8221; which would order states to obtain proof of citizenship, such as a passport or a birth certificate, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/us/politics/house-citizenship-elections-save-act.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in person from those seeking to register to vote</a>.</p>
<p>Critics say the SAVE Act could disenfranchise millions of voters and discourage eligible voters from registering to vote. What&#8217;s more, documented cases of voter fraud are few and far between, as is voting by non-citizens. Even the conservative <strong>Heritage Foundation</strong> acknowledges as much: An interactive &#8220;<a href="https://electionfraud.heritage.org/search" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election fraud map</a>&#8221; published by Heritage lists just 1,576 convictions or findings of voter fraud between 1982 and the present day.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the GOP-led House passed the SAVE Act with the help of four Democrats. Its passage in the Senate will require support from at least seven Democrats, Newsweek <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/democrats-who-could-cross-aisle-save-act-2058792" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writes</a>.</p>
<p>In February, CISA cut roughly 130 employees, including its election security advisors. The agency also was forced to freeze all election security activities pending an internal review. The review was <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/how-federal-government-undermining-election-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly</a> completed in March, but the Trump administration has said the findings would not be made public, and there is no indication of whether any cybersecurity support has been restored.</p>
<p>Many state leaders have voiced anxiety over the administration&#8217;s cuts to CISA programs that provide assistance and threat intelligence to election security efforts. <strong>Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate</strong> last week <a href="https://www.thegazette.com/campaigns-elections/iowas-top-elections-official-concerned-over-cybersecurity-funding-pause/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> the <strong>PBS</strong> show I<strong>owa Press</strong> he would not want to see those programs dissolve.</p>
<p>&#8220;If those (systems) were to go away, it would be pretty serious,&#8221; Pate said. &#8220;We do count on a lot those cyber protections.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pennsylvania&#8217;s <strong>Secretary of the Commonwealth Al Schmidt</strong> recently warned the CISA election security cuts would make elections less secure, and said no state on its own can replace federal election cybersecurity resources.</p>
<p>The <strong>Pennsylvania Capital-Star</strong> <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/election-2025/no-state-on-its-own-can-replace-federal-election-cybersecurity-resources-pa-voting-official-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> that several local election offices received bomb threats around the time polls closed on Nov. 5, and that in the week before the election a fake video showing mail-in ballots cast for Trump and Sen. Dave McCormick (R-Pa.) being destroyed and thrown away was linked to a Russian disinformation campaign.</p>
<p>&#8220;CISA was able to quickly identify not only that it was fraudulent, but also the source of it, so that we could share with our counties and we could share with the public so confidence in the election wasn’t undermined,&#8221; Schmidt said.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://archive.ph/InCFx#selection-2339.13-2339.483" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNN</a>, the administration&#8217;s actions have deeply alarmed state officials, who warn the next round of national elections will be seriously imperiled by the cuts. A bipartisan association representing 46 secretaries of state, and several individual top state election officials, have pressed the White House about how critical functions of protecting election security will perform going forward. However, CNN reports they have yet to receive clear answers.</p>
<p>Nevada and 18 other states are suing Trump over <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/preserving-and-protecting-the-integrity-of-american-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an executive order he issued on March 25</a> that asserts the executive branch has broad authority over state election procedures.</p>
<p>&#8220;None of the president’s powers allow him to change the rules of elections,&#8221; Nevada Secretary of State <strong>Cisco Aguilar</strong> wrote in <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/nevada-18-states-are-suing-trump-election-executive-order-rcna200427" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an April 11 op-ed</a>. &#8220;That is an intentional feature of our Constitution, which the Framers built in to ensure election integrity. Despite that, Trump is seeking to upend the voter registration process; impose arbitrary deadlines on vote counting; allow an unelected and unaccountable billionaire to invade state voter rolls; and withhold congressionally approved funding for election security.&#8221;</p>
<p>The order instructs the <strong>U.S. Election Assistance Commission</strong> to abruptly amend the voluntary federal guidelines for voting machines without going through the processes mandated by federal law. And it calls for allowing the administrator of the so-called <strong>Department of Government Efficiency</strong> (DOGE), along with DHS, to review state voter registration lists and other records to identify non-citizens.</p>
<p>The Atlantic&#8217;s <strong>Paul Rosenzweig</strong> notes that the chief executive of the country &#8212; whose unilateral authority the Founding Fathers most feared &#8212; has literally no role in the federal election system.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trump&#8217;s executive order on elections ignores that design entirely,&#8221; Rosenzweig <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/04/trump-election-rules-changes/682394/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>. &#8220;He is asserting an executive-branch role in governing the mechanics of a federal election that has never before been claimed by a president. The legal theory undergirding this assertion &#8212; that the president&#8217;s authority to enforce federal law enables him to control state election activity &#8212; is as capacious as it is frightening.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China-based purveyors of SMS phishing kits are enjoying remarkable success converting phished payment card data into mobile wallets from <strong>Apple</strong> and <strong>Google</strong>. Until recently, the so-called &#8220;<strong>Smishing Triad</strong>&#8221; mainly impersonated toll road operators and shipping companies. But experts say these groups are now directly targeting customers of international financial institutions, while dramatically expanding their cybercrime infrastructure and support staff.</p>
<div id="attachment_70947" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-70947" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-70947" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/wall-o-phones.png" alt="" width="750" height="762" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/wall-o-phones.png 868w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/wall-o-phones-768x780.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/wall-o-phones-782x794.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><p id="caption-attachment-70947" class="wp-caption-text">An image of an iPhone device farm shared on Telegram by one of the Smishing Triad members. Image: Prodaft.</p></div>
<p>If you own a mobile device, the chances are excellent that at some point in the past two years you&#8217;ve received at least one instant message that warns of a delinquent toll road fee, or a wayward package from the <strong>U.S. Postal Service </strong>(USPS). Those who click the promoted link are brought to a website that spoofs the USPS or a local toll road operator and asks for payment card information.</p>
<p>The site will then complain that the visitor&#8217;s bank needs to &#8220;verify&#8221; the transaction by sending a one-time code via SMS. In reality, the bank is sending that code to the mobile number on file for their customer because the fraudsters have just attempted to enroll that victim&#8217;s card details into a mobile wallet.</p>
<p>If the visitor supplies that one-time code, their payment card is then added to a new mobile wallet on an Apple or Google device that is physically controlled by the phishers. The phishing gangs typically load <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/phishingphones.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple stolen cards to digital wallets on a single Apple or Android device</a>, and then sell those phones in bulk to scammers who use them for fraudulent e-commerce and tap-to-pay transactions.</p>
<div id="attachment_70953" style="width: 759px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mobwalletimage.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-70953" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-70953" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mobwalletimage.png" alt="" width="749" height="396" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mobwalletimage.png 1322w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mobwalletimage-768x405.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mobwalletimage-782x413.png 782w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mobwalletimage-267x140.png 267w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-70953" class="wp-caption-text">A screenshot of the administrative panel for a smishing kit. On the left is the (test) data entered at the phishing site. On the right we can see the phishing kit has superimposed the supplied card number onto an image of a payment card. When the phishing kit scans that created card image into Apple or Google Pay, it triggers the victim&#8217;s bank to send a one-time code. Image: Ford Merrill.</p></div>
<p>The moniker &#8220;Smishing Triad&#8221; comes from <strong>Resecurity</strong>, which was among <a href="https://www.resecurity.com/blog/article/smishing-triad-targeted-usps-and-us-citizens-for-data-theft" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the first to report in August 2023</a> on the emergence of three distinct mobile phishing groups based in China that appeared to share some infrastructure and innovative phishing techniques. But it is a bit of a misnomer because the phishing lures blasted out by these groups are not SMS or text messages in the conventional sense.</p>
<p>Rather, they are sent via <strong>iMessage</strong> to <strong>Apple</strong> device users, and via RCS on <strong>Google Android</strong> devices. Thus, the missives bypass the mobile phone networks entirely and enjoy near 100 percent delivery rate (at least until Apple and Google suspend the spammy accounts).</p>
<p>In <a href="https://catalyst.prodaft.com/public/report/lucid/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a report</a> published on March 24, the Swiss threat intelligence firm <strong>Prodaft</strong> detailed the rapid pace of innovation coming from the Smishing Triad, which it characterizes as a loosely federated group of Chinese phishing-as-a-service operators with names like <strong>Darcula</strong>, <strong>Lighthouse</strong>, and the <strong>Xinxin Group</strong>.</p>
<p>Prodaft said they&#8217;re seeing a significant shift in the underground economy, particularly among Chinese-speaking threat actors who have historically operated in the shadows compared to their Russian-speaking counterparts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chinese-speaking actors are introducing innovative and cost-effective systems, enabling them to target larger user bases with sophisticated services,&#8221; Prodaft wrote. &#8220;Their approach marks a new era in underground business practices, emphasizing scalability and efficiency in cybercriminal operations.&#8221;</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.silentpush.com/blog/smishing-triad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new report</a> from researchers at the security firm <strong>SilentPush</strong> finds the Smishing Triad members have expanded into selling mobile phishing kits targeting customers of global financial institutions like <strong>CitiGroup</strong>, <strong>MasterCard</strong>, <strong>PayPal</strong>,<strong> Stripe</strong>, and <strong>Visa</strong>, as well as banks in Canada, Latin America, Australia and the broader Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<div id="attachment_70946" style="width: 733px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-70946" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-70946" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/paypalsmish.png" alt="" width="723" height="512" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/paypalsmish.png 723w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/paypalsmish-100x70.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" /><p id="caption-attachment-70946" class="wp-caption-text">Phishing lures from the Smishing Triad spoofing PayPal. Image: SilentPush.</p></div>
<p>SilentPush found the Smishing Triad now spoofs recognizable brands in a variety of industry verticals across at least 121 countries and a vast number of industries, including the postal, logistics, telecommunications, transportation, finance, retail and public sectors.</p>
<p>According to SilentPush, the domains used by the Smishing Triad are rotated frequently, with approximately 25,000 phishing domains active during any 8-day period and a majority of them sitting at two Chinese hosting companies: <strong>Tencent</strong> (AS132203) and <strong>Alibaba</strong> (AS45102).<span id="more-70793"></span></p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;With nearly two-thirds of all countries in the world targeted by [the] Smishing Triad, it’s safe to say they are essentially targeting every country with modern infrastructure outside of Iran, North Korea, and Russia,&#8221; SilentPush wrote. &#8220;Our team has observed some potential targeting in Russia (such as domains that mentioned their country codes), but nothing definitive enough to indicate Russia is a persistent target. Interestingly, even though these are Chinese threat actors, we have seen instances of targeting aimed at Macau and Hong Kong, both special administrative regions of China.&#8221;</p>
<p>SilentPush&#8217;s <strong>Zach Edwards</strong> said his team found a vulnerability that exposed data from one of the Smishing Triad&#8217;s phishing pages, which revealed the number of visits each site received each day across thousands of phishing domains that were active at the time. Based on that data, SilentPush estimates those phishing pages received well more than a million visits within a 20-day time span.</p>
<p class="p1">The report notes the Smishing Triad boasts it has “300+ front desk staff worldwide” involved in one of their more popular phishing kits &#8212; Lighthouse &#8212; staff that is mainly used to support various aspects of the group&#8217;s fraud and cash-out schemes.</p>
<p>The Smishing Triad members maintain their own Chinese-language sales channels on Telegram, which frequently offer videos and photos of their staff hard at work. Some of those images include massive walls of phones used to send phishing messages, with human operators seated directly in front of them ready to receive any time-sensitive one-time codes.</p>
<p>As noted in February&#8217;s story <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/02/how-phished-data-turns-into-apple-google-wallets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How Phished Data Turns Into Apple and Google Wallets</a>, one of those cash-out schemes involves an Android app called <strong>Z-NFC</strong>, which can relay a valid NFC transaction from one of these compromised digital wallets to anywhere in the world. For a $500 month subscription, the customer can wave their phone at any payment terminal that accepts Apple or Google pay, and the app will relay an NFC transaction over the Internet from a stolen wallet on a phone in China.</p>

<p>Chinese nationals were recently busted trying to use these NFC apps to buy high-end electronics in Singapore. And in the United States, authorities in California and Tennessee <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/03/arrests-in-tap-to-pay-scheme-powered-by-phishing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arrested Chinese nationals accused of using NFC apps</a> to fraudulently purchase gift cards from retailers.</p>
<p>The Prodaft researchers said they were able to find a previously undocumented backend management panel for <strong>Lucid</strong>, a smishing-as-a-service operation tied to the XinXin Group. The panel included victim figures that suggest the smishing campaigns maintain an average success rate of approximately five percent, with some domains receiving over 500 visits per week.</p>
<p>&#8220;In one observed instance, a single phishing website captured 30 credit card records from 550 victim interactions over a 7-day period,&#8221; Prodaft wrote.</p>
<p>Prodaft&#8217;s report details how the Smishing Triad has achieved such success in sending their spam messages. For example, one phishing vendor appears to send out messages using dozens of Android device emulators running in parallel on a single machine.</p>

<p>According to Prodaft, the threat actors first acquire phone numbers through various means including data breaches, open-source intelligence, or purchased lists from underground markets. They then exploit technical gaps in sender ID validation within both messaging platforms.</p>
<p>&#8220;For iMessage, this involves creating temporary Apple IDs with impersonated display names, while RCS exploitation leverages carrier implementation inconsistencies in sender verification,&#8221; Prodaft wrote. &#8220;Message delivery occurs through automated platforms using VoIP numbers or compromised credentials, often deployed in precisely timed multi-wave campaigns to maximize effectiveness.</p>
<p>In addition, the phishing links embedded in these messages use time-limited single-use URLs that expire or redirect based on device fingerprinting to evade security analysis, they found.</p>
<p>&#8220;The economics strongly favor the attackers, as neither RCS nor iMessage messages incur per-message costs like traditional SMS, enabling high-volume campaigns at minimal operational expense,&#8221; Prodaft continued. &#8220;The overlap in templates, target pools, and tactics among these platforms underscores a unified threat landscape, with Chinese-speaking actors driving innovation in the underground economy. Their ability to scale operations globally and evasion techniques pose significant challenges to cybersecurity defenses.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Ford Merrill</strong> works in security research at <a href="https://www.secalliance.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SecAlliance</a>, a <a href="https://www.csis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CSIS Security Group</a> company. Merrill said he&#8217;s observed at least one video of a Windows binary that wraps a Chrome executable and can be used to load in target phone numbers and blast messages via RCS, iMessage, Amazon, Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp.</p>
<p>&#8220;The evidence we’ve observed suggests the ability for a single device to send approximately 100 messages per second,&#8221; Merrill said. &#8220;We also believe that there is capability to source country specific SIM cards in volume that allow them to register different online accounts that require validation with specific country codes, and even make those SIM cards available to the physical devices long-term so that services that rely on checks of the validity of the phone number or SIM card presence on a mobile network are thwarted.&#8221;</p>
<p>Experts say this fast-growing wave of card fraud persists because far too many financial institutions still default to sending one-time codes via SMS for validating card enrollment in mobile wallets from Apple or Google. KrebsOnSecurity interviewed multiple security executives at non-U.S. financial institutions who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. Those banks have since done away with SMS-based one-time codes and are now requiring customers to log in to the bank’s mobile app before they can link their card to a digital wallet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Microsoft</strong> today released updates to plug at least 121 security holes in its <strong>Windows</strong> operating systems and software, including one vulnerability that is already being exploited in the wild. Eleven of those flaws earned Microsoft&#8217;s most-dire &#8220;critical&#8221; rating, meaning malware or malcontents could exploit them with little to no interaction from Windows users.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-56287" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/windupate.png" alt="" width="750" height="528" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/windupate.png 841w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/windupate-768x541.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/windupate-782x550.png 782w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/windupate-100x70.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p>The zero-day flaw already seeing exploitation is <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-29824" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2025-29824</a>, a local elevation of privilege bug in the Windows <strong>Common Log File System</strong> (CLFS) driver.  Microsoft rates it as &#8220;important,&#8221; but as <strong>Chris Goettl</strong> from <strong>Ivanti</strong> points out, risk-based prioritization warrants treating it as critical.</p>
<p>This CLFS component of Windows is no stranger to Patch Tuesday: According to Tenable&#8217;s <strong>Satnam Narang</strong>, since 2022 Microsoft has patched 32 CLFS vulnerabilities &#8212; averaging 10 per year &#8212; with six of them exploited in the wild. The <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2024-49138" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last CLFS zero-day</a> was <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/12/patch-tuesday-december-2024-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patched in December 2024</a>.</p>
<p>Narang notes that while flaws allowing attackers to install arbitrary code are consistently top overall Patch Tuesday features, the data is reversed for zero-day exploitation.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the past two years, elevation of privilege flaws have led the pack and, so far in 2025, account for over half of all zero-days exploited,&#8221; Narang wrote.<span id="more-70933"></span></p>
<p>Rapid7&#8217;s <strong>Adam Barnett</strong> warns that any Windows defenders responsible for an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LDAP server</a> — which means almost any organization with a non-trivial Microsoft footprint — should add <span class="il">patching</span> for the critical flaw <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-26663" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-26663&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1744231709116000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3moAqrbzoHqolAikc6dYLo">CVE-2025-26663</a> to their to-do list.</p>
<p>&#8220;With no privileges required, no need for user interaction, and code execution presumably in the context of the LDAP server itself, successful exploitation would be an attractive shortcut to any attacker,&#8221; Barnett said. &#8220;Anyone wondering if today is a re-run of December 2024 <span class="il">Patch</span> <span class="il">Tuesday</span> can take some small solace in the fact that the worst of the <a href="https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2024/12/10/patch-tuesday-december-2024/#ldap-critical-rce" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2024/12/10/patch-tuesday-december-2024/%23ldap-critical-rce&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1744231709116000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2C4e66FL53_LrZBhrndLUw">trio of LDAP critical RCEs published at the end of last year</a> was likely easier to exploit than today’s example, since today’s CVE-2025-26663 requires that an attacker win a race condition. Despite that, Microsoft still expects that exploitation is more likely.&#8221;</p>
<p>Among the critical updates Microsoft patched this month are remote code execution flaws in <strong>Windows Remote Desktop </strong>services (RDP), including <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-26671" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2025-26671</a>, <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-27480" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2025-27480</a> and <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-27482" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2025-27482</a>; only the latter two are rated &#8220;critical,&#8221; and Microsoft marked both of them as “Exploitation More Likely.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps the most widespread vulnerabilities fixed this month were in web browsers. <strong>Google Chrome</strong> <a href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated</a> to fix 13 flaws this week, and <strong>Mozilla Firefox </strong>fixed <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2025-20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eight bugs</a>, with possibly more updates coming later this week for <strong>Microsoft</strong> <strong>Edge</strong>.</p>
<p>As it tends to do on Patch Tuesdays, <strong>Adobe</strong> has <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/security-bulletin.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released 12 updates</a> resolving 54 security holes across a range of products, including <strong>ColdFusion</strong>, <strong>Adobe Commerce</strong>, <strong>Experience Manager Forms</strong>, <strong>After Effects</strong>, <strong>Media Encoder</strong>, <strong>Bridge</strong>, <strong>Premiere Pro</strong>, <strong>Photoshop</strong>, <strong>Animate</strong>, <strong>AEM Screens</strong>, and <strong>FrameMaker</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Apple</strong> users may need to patch as well. On March 31, Apple released a huge security update (more than three gigabytes in size) to fix issues in a range of their products, including <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/apple-backports-zero-day-patches-to-older-iphones-and-macs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at least one zero-day flaw</a>.</p>
<p>And in case you missed it, on March 31, 2025 <strong>Apple</strong> released <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/100100?is=1ef7934f6635b02395adcab09a0c1b24bf0ea745b648bfe87189de8aadc7300b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a rather large batch of security updates</a> for a wide range of their products, from <strong>macOS</strong> to the<strong> iOS</strong> operating systems on <strong>iPhones</strong> and <strong>iPads</strong>.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Microsoft included a note saying <strong>Windows 10</strong> security updates weren&#8217;t available but would be released as soon as possible. It appears from browsing <a href="https://www.askwoody.com/2025/april-2025-updates-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">askwoody.com</a> that this snafu has since been rectified. Either way, if you run into complications applying any of these updates please leave a note about it in the comments below, because the chances are good that someone else had the same problem.</p>
<p>As ever, please consider backing up your data and or devices prior to updating, which makes it far less complicated to undo a software update gone awry.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Minnesota cybersecurity and computer forensics expert whose testimony has featured in thousands of courtroom trials over the past 30 years is facing questions about his credentials and an inquiry from the <strong>Federal Bureau of Investigation</strong> (FBI). Legal experts say the inquiry could be grounds to reopen a number of adjudicated cases in which the expert&#8217;s testimony may have been pivotal.</p>
<div id="attachment_70889" style="width: 827px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-70889" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-70889" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/marklanterman-linkedin.png" alt="" width="817" height="597" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/marklanterman-linkedin.png 817w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/marklanterman-linkedin-768x561.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/marklanterman-linkedin-782x571.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 817px) 100vw, 817px" /><p id="caption-attachment-70889" class="wp-caption-text">One might conclude from reading Mr. Lanterman&#8217;s LinkedIn profile that has a degree from Harvard University.</p></div>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marklanterman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark Lanterman</a></strong> is a former investigator for the U.S. Secret Service Electronics Crimes Task Force who founded the Minneapolis consulting firm <strong>Computer Forensic Services</strong> (CFS). The CFS website says Lanterman&#8217;s 30-year career has seen him testify as an expert in more than 2,000 cases, with experience in cases involving sexual harassment and workplace claims, theft of intellectual property and trade secrets, white-collar crime, and class action lawsuits.</p>
<p>Or at least it did until last month, when Lanterman&#8217;s profile and work history were quietly removed from the CFS website. The removal came after <strong>Hennepin County Attorney&#8217;s Office</strong> <a href="https://www.hennepinattorney.org/news/news/2025/March/lanterman-disclosure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> it was notifying parties to ten pending cases that they were unable to verify Lanterman&#8217;s educational and employment background. The county attorney also said the FBI is now investigating the allegations.</p>
<p>Those allegations were raised by <strong>Sean Harrington</strong>, an attorney and forensics examiner based in Prescott, Wisconsin. Harrington alleged that Lanterman lied under oath in court on multiple occasions when he testified that he has a Bachelor of Science and a Master&#8217;s degree in computer science from the now-defunct <strong>Upsala College</strong>, and that he completed his postgraduate work in cybersecurity at <strong>Harvard University</strong>.</p>
<p>Harrington&#8217;s claims gained steam thanks to digging by the law firm <strong>Perkins Coie LLP</strong>, which is defending a case wherein a client&#8217;s laptop was forensically reviewed by Lanterman. On March 14, Perkins Coie attorneys <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/155-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asked the judge</a> (PDF) to strike Lanterman&#8217;s testimony because neither he nor they could substantiate claims about his educational background.</p>
<p>Upsala College, located in East Orange, N.J., operated for 102 years until it closed in 1995 after a period of declining enrollment and financial difficulties. Perkins Coie told the court that they&#8217;d visited <strong>Felician University</strong>, which holds the transcripts for Upsala College during the years Lanterman claimed to have earned undergraduate and graduate degrees. The law firm said Felician <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/155-21.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had no record of transcripts for Lanterman</a> (PDF), and that his name was absent from all of the Upsala College student yearbooks and commencement programs during that period.</p>
<p>Reached for comment, Lanterman acknowledged he had no way to prove he attended Upsala College, and that his &#8220;postgraduate work&#8221; at Harvard was in fact an eight-week online cybersecurity class called <strong>HarvardX</strong>, which cautions that its certificates should not be considered equivalent to a Harvard degree or a certificate earned through traditional, in-person programs at Harvard University.</p>
<p>Lanterman has testified that his first job after college was serving as a police officer in Springfield Township, Pennsylvania, although the Perkins Coie attorneys noted that this role was omitted from his resume. The attorneys said when they tried to verify Lanterman&#8217;s work history, &#8220;the police department responded with a story that would be almost impossible to believe if it was not corroborated by Lanterman&#8217;s own email communications.&#8221;</p>
<p>As recounted in the March 14 filing, Lanterman was deposed on Feb. 11, and the following day <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/155-21.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he emailed the Springfield Township Police Department</a> to see if he could have a peek at his old personnel file. On Feb. 14, Lanterman visited the Springfield Township PD and asked to borrow his employment record. He told the officer he spoke with on the phone that he&#8217;d recently been instructed to &#8220;get his affairs in order&#8221; after being diagnosed with a grave heart condition, and that he wanted his old file to show his family about his early career.</p>
<p>According to Perkins Coie, Lanterman left the Springfield Township PD with his personnel file, and has not returned it as promised.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is shocking that an expert from Minnesota would travel to suburban Philadelphia and abscond with his decades-old personnel file to obscure his background,&#8221; the law firm wrote. &#8220;That appears to be the worst and most egregious form of spoliation, and the deception alone is reason enough to exclude Lanterman and consider sanctions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harrington initially contacted KrebsOnSecurity about his concerns in late 2023, fuming after sitting through <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/srxrxkwyf03inudrw9ymn/2023-Seminar-Recording-copy-copy-1.MP4?rlkey=th0yqylm5uvmq84skfg8qvfh3&amp;e=1&amp;dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a conference speech</a> in which Lanterman shared documents from a ransomware victim and told attendees it was because they&#8217;d refused to hire his company to perform a forensic investigation on a recent breach.</p>
<p>&#8220;He claims he was involved in the Martha Stewart investigation, the Bernie Madoff trial, Paul McCartney’s divorce, the Tom Petters investigation, the Denny Hecker investigation, and many others,&#8221; Harrington said. &#8220;He claims to have been invited to speak to the Supreme Court, claims to train the &#8216;entire federal judiciary&#8217; on cybersecurity annually, and is a faculty member of the United States Judicial Conference and the Judicial College — positions which he obtained, in part, on a house of fraudulent cards.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an interview this week, Harrington said court documents reveal that at least two of Lanterman&#8217;s previous clients complained CFS had held their data for ransom over billing disputes. In <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2022-10-26_Declaration-ofKimberlyHanlon.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a declaration</a> (PDF) dated August 2022, the co-founder of the law firm <strong>MoreLaw Minneapolis LLC</strong> said she hired Lanterman in 2014 to examine several electronic devices after learning that one of their paralegals had a criminal fraud history.</p>
<p>But the law firm said when it pushed back on a consulting bill that was far higher than expected, Lanterman told them CFS would &#8220;escalate&#8221; its collection efforts if they didn&#8217;t pay, including &#8220;a claim and lien against the data which will result in a public auction of your data.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All of us were flabbergasted by Mr. Lanterman’s email,&#8221; wrote MoreLaw co-founder <strong>Kimberly Hanlon</strong>. &#8220;I had never heard of any legitimate forensic company threatening to &#8216;auction&#8217; off an attorney’s data, particularly knowing that the data is comprised of confidential client data, much of which is sensitive in nature.&#8221;<span id="more-70780"></span></p>
<p>In 2009, a Wisconsin-based manufacturing company that had hired Lanterman for computer forensics balked at paying an $86,000 invoice from CFS, calling it &#8220;excessive and unsubstantiated.&#8221; The company told a Hennepin County court that on April 15, 2009, CFS conducted an auction of its trade secret information in violation of their confidentiality agreement.</p>
<p>&#8220;CFS noticed and conducted a Public Sale of electronic information that was entrusted to them pursuant to the terms of the engagement agreement,&#8221; the company wrote. &#8220;CFS submitted the highest bid at the Public Sale in the amount of $10,000.&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-70891" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/27-cv-12-22089-ExtrusionDiesIndustries.png" alt="" width="1039" height="439" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/27-cv-12-22089-ExtrusionDiesIndustries.png 1039w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/27-cv-12-22089-ExtrusionDiesIndustries-768x324.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/27-cv-12-22089-ExtrusionDiesIndustries-782x330.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 1039px) 100vw, 1039px" /></p>
<p>Lanterman briefly responded to a list of questions about his background (and recent heart diagnosis) on March 24, saying he would send detailed replies the following day. Those replies never materialized. Instead, Lanterman forwarded a recent memo he wrote to the court that attacked Harrington and said his accuser was only trying to take out a competitor. He has not responded to further requests for comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I attended Upsala, I was a commuter student who lived with my grandparents in Morristown, New Jersey approximately 30 minutes away from Upsala College,&#8221; Lanterman <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ACU-Plasmold-Lanterman-Repsonse-Letter.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained to the judge</a> (PDF) overseeing <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-03-12_memo-toCourt-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a separate ongoing case</a> (PDF) in which he has testified. &#8220;With limited resources, I did not participate in campus social events, nor did I attend graduation ceremonies. In 2023, I confirmed with Felician University — which maintains Upsala College’s records — that they could not locate my transcripts or diploma, a situation that they indicated was possibly due to unresolved money-related issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lanterman was ordered to appear in court on April 3 in the case defended by Perkins Coie, but he did not show up. Instead, he sent a message to the judge withdrawing from the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am 60 years old,&#8221; Lanterman <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/lanterman-retire.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told the judge</a>. &#8220;I created my business from nothing. I am done dealing with the likes of individuals like Sean Harrington. And quite frankly, I have been planning at turning over my business to my children for years. That time has arrived.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lanterman&#8217;s letter leaves the impression that it was his decision to retire. But according to <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/affidavit-seanlanterman.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an affidavit</a> (PDF) filed in a Florida case on March 28, Mark Lanterman&#8217;s son Sean said he&#8217;d made the difficult decision to ask his dad to step down given all the negative media attention.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Rasch</strong>, a former federal cybercrime prosecutor who now serves as counsel to the New York cybersecurity intelligence firm <a href="https://www.unit221b.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unit 221B</a>, said that if an expert witness is discredited, any defendants who lost cases that were strongly influenced by that expert&#8217;s conclusions at trial could have grounds for appeal.</p>
<p>Rasch said law firms who propose an expert witness have a duty in good faith to vet that expert&#8217;s qualifications, knowing that those credentials will be subject to cross-examination.</p>
<p>&#8220;Federal rules of civil procedure and evidence both require experts to list every case they have testified in as an expert for the past few years,&#8221; Rasch said. &#8220;Part of that due diligence is pulling up the results of those cases and seeing what the nature of their testimony has been.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps the most well-publicized case involving significant forensic findings from Lanterman was the 2018 conviction of <strong>Stephen Allwine</strong>, who was <a href="https://www.fox9.com/news/convicted-dark-net-killer-claims-innocence-i-couldnt-have-done-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found guilty of killing his wife</a> two years earlier after attempts at hiring a hitman on the dark net fell through. Allwine is serving a sentence of life in prison, and continues to maintain that he was framed, casting doubt on computer forensic evidence found on 64 electronic devices taken from his home.</p>
<p>On March 24, Allwine <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/78.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">petitioned a Minnesota court</a> (PDF) to revisit his case, citing the accusations against Lanterman and his role as a key witness for the prosecution.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&#8220;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.&#8221; -U.S. Constitution, First Amendment.</em></p>
<div id="attachment_70858" style="width: 757px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-70858" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-70858" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/1stamendment.png" alt="" width="747" height="508" /><p id="caption-attachment-70858" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Shutterstock, zimmytws.</p></div>
<p>In an address to Congress this month, <strong>President Trump</strong> claimed he had &#8220;brought free speech back to America.&#8221; But barely two months into his second term, the president has waged an unprecedented attack on the First Amendment rights of journalists, students, universities, government workers, lawyers and judges.</p>
<p>This story explores a slew of recent actions by the Trump administration that threaten to undermine all five pillars of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees freedoms concerning speech, religion, the media, the right to assembly, and the right to petition the government and seek redress for wrongs.</p>
<h2>THE RIGHT TO PETITION</h2>
<p>The right to petition allows citizens to communicate with the government, whether to complain, request action, or share viewpoints &#8212; without fear of reprisal. But that right is being assaulted by this administration on multiple levels. For starters, many GOP lawmakers are now heeding their leadership&#8217;s advice to stay away from local town hall meetings and avoid the wrath of constituents affected by the administration&#8217;s many federal budget and workforce cuts.</p>
<p>Another example: President Trump recently <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/18/politics/opm-privacy-team-fired/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fired most of the people</a> involved in processing <strong>Freedom of Information Act</strong> (FOIA) requests for government agencies. FOIA is an indispensable tool used by journalists and the public to request government records, and to hold leaders accountable.</p>
<p>The biggest story by far this week was the bombshell from The Atlantic editor <strong>Jeffrey Goldberg</strong>, who recounted how he was <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/?gift=DjgA9DZGvABas7wFCM-ptk0vpPuikYUZT9Ej3cJbK1s&amp;utm_source=copy-link&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=share" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inadvertently added to a Signal group chat</a> with <strong>National Security Advisor Michael Waltz</strong> and 16 other Trump administration officials discussing plans for an upcoming attack on Yemen.</p>
<p>One overlooked aspect of Goldberg&#8217;s incredible account is that by planning and coordinating the attack on Signal &#8212; which features messages that can auto-delete after a short time &#8212; administration officials were evidently seeking a way to avoid creating a lasting (and potentially FOIA-able) record of their deliberations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Intentional or not, use of Signal in this context was an act of erasure—because without Jeffrey Goldberg being accidentally added to the list, the general public would never have any record of these communications or any way to know they even occurred,&#8221; <strong>Tony Bradley</strong> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonybradley/2025/03/26/what-everyone-has-missed-about-the-trump-administration-signal-scandal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote this week at Forbes</a>.</p>
<p>Petitioning the government, particularly when it ignores your requests, often requires challenging federal agencies in court. But that becomes far more difficult if the most competent law firms start to shy away from cases that may involve crossing the president and his administration.</p>
<p>On March 22, the president issued <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/preventing-abuses-of-the-legal-system-and-the-federal-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a memorandum</a> that directs heads of the Justice and Homeland Security Departments to &#8220;seek sanctions against attorneys and law firms who engage in frivolous, unreasonable and vexatious litigation against the United States,&#8221; or in matters that come before federal agencies.</p>
<p>The POTUS recently issued several executive orders railing against specific law firms with attorneys who worked legal cases against him. On Friday, the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-28/trump-says-he-s-reached-100-million-pro-bono-deal-with-skadden" target="_blank" rel="noopener">president announced</a> that the law firm of <strong>Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meager &amp; Flom</strong> had agreed to provide $100 million in pro bono work on issues that he supports.</p>
<p>Trump issued <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-remedial-action-by-paul-weiss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another order</a> naming the firm <strong>Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison</strong>, which ultimately agreed to pledge $40 million in pro bono legal services to the president&#8217;s causes.</p>
<p>Other Trump executive orders targeted law firms <strong>Jenner &amp; Block</strong> and <strong>WilmerHale</strong>, both of which have attorneys that worked with special counsel Robert Mueller on the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. But this week, two federal judges in separate rulings <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/28/politics/law-firms-fighting-trump-executive-order/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">froze parts of those orders</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no doubt this retaliatory action chills speech and legal advocacy, and that is qualified as a constitutional harm,&#8221; wrote <strong>Judge Richard Leon</strong>, who ruled against the executive order targeting WilmerHale.</p>
<p>President Trump recently took the extraordinary step of calling for the impeachment of federal judges who rule against the administration. Trump called <strong>U.S. District Judge James Boasberg</strong> <a class=" js-tealium-tracking " href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/18/trump-impeachment-judge-deportations-00235173" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-tracking="mpos=&amp;mid=&amp;lindex=&amp;lcol=" aria-label=" (Opens in a new window)">a “Radical Left Lunatic”</a> and urged he be removed from office for blocking deportation of Venezuelan alleged gang members under a rarely invoked wartime legal authority.</p>
<p>In a rare public rebuke to a sitting president, <strong>U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Roberts</strong> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-chief-justice-roberts-calls-judges-impeachment-are-inappropriate-after-trump-2025-03-18/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issued a statement on March 18</a> pointing out that &#8220;For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.&#8221;</p>
<p>The U.S. Constitution provides that judges can be removed from office only through impeachment by the House of Representatives and conviction by the Senate. The Constitution also states that judges&#8217; salaries cannot be reduced while they are in office.</p>
<p>Undeterred, <strong>House Speaker Mike Johnson </strong>this week suggested the administration could still use the power of its purse to keep courts in line, and even <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/now/video/speaker-mike-johnson-floats-possibility-of-congress-eliminating-federal-courts-235397189724" target="_blank" rel="noopener">floated the idea of wholesale eliminating federal courts</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do have authority over the federal courts as you know,&#8221; Johnson said. &#8220;We can eliminate an entire district court. We have power of funding over the courts, and all these other things. But desperate times call for desperate measures, and Congress is going to act, so stay tuned for that.&#8221;</p>
<h2>FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY</h2>
<p>President Trump has taken a number of actions to discourage lawful demonstrations at universities and colleges across the country, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-federal-funding-will-stop-colleges-schools-allowing-illegal-protests-2025-03-04/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">threatening to cut federal funding</a> for any college that supports protests he deems &#8220;illegal.&#8221;</p>
<p>A Trump <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/additional-measures-to-combat-anti-semitism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">executive order in January</a> outlined a broad federal crackdown on what he called &#8220;the explosion of antisemitism&#8221; on U.S. college campuses. This administration has asserted that foreign students who are lawfully in the United States on visas do not enjoy the same free speech or due process rights as citizens.</p>
<p><strong>Reuters</strong> reports that the acting civil rights director at the <strong>Department of Education</strong> <a href="https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-educations-office-civil-rights-sends-letters-60-universities-under-investigation-antisemitic-discrimination-and-harassment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on March 10 sent letters to 60 educational institutions</a> warning they could lose federal funding if they don&#8217;t do more to combat anti-semitism. On March 20, Trump issued an order calling for <a href="https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/statement-president-trumps-executive-order-return-power-over-education-states-and-local-communities" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the closure of the Education Department</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <strong>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement</strong> (ICE) agents have been <a href="https://apnews.com/article/immigration-detainees-students-ozturk-khalil-78f544fb2c8b593c88a0c1f0e0ad9c5f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detaining and trying to deport</a> pro-Palestinian students who are legally in the United States. The administration is targeting students and academics who spoke out against Israel&#8217;s attacks on Gaza, or who were active in campus protests against U.S. support for the attacks. <strong>Secretary of State Marco Rubio</strong> <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5218410-ice-arrests-tufts-alabama-students-trump-immigration-crackdown-rumeysa-ozturk-khalil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told reporters Thursday</a> that at least 300 foreign students have seen their visas revoked under President Trump, a far higher number than was previously known.</p>
<p>In his first term, Trump threatened to use the national guard or the U.S. military to deal with protesters, and in campaigning for re-election he promised to revisit the idea.</p>
<p>“I think the bigger problem is the enemy from within,” Trump told <strong>Fox News</strong> in October 2024. “We have some very bad people. We have some sick people, radical left lunatics. And I think they’re the big — and it should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard, or if really necessary, by the military, because they can’t let that happen.”</p>
<p>This term, Trump acted swiftly to remove the top judicial advocates in the armed forces who would almost certainly push back on any request by the president to use U.S. soldiers in an effort to quell public protests, or to arrest and detain immigrants. In late February, the president and <strong>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth</strong> fired the top legal officers for the military services &#8212; those responsible for ensuring the Uniform Code of Military Justice is followed by commanders.</p>
<p>Military.com <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/02/24/people-are-very-scared-trump-administration-purge-of-jag-officers-raises-legal-ethical-fears.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">warns</a> that the purge &#8220;sets an alarming precedent for a crucial job in the military, as President Donald Trump has mused about using the military in unorthodox and potentially illegal ways.&#8221; Hegseth told reporters the removals were necessary because he didn&#8217;t want them to pose any &#8220;roadblocks to orders that are given by a commander in chief.&#8221;<span id="more-70660"></span></p>
<h2>FREEDOM OF THE PRESS</h2>
<p>President Trump has sued a number of U.S. news outlets, including <strong>60 Minutes</strong>, <strong>CNN</strong>, <strong>The Washington Post</strong>, <strong>The New York Times</strong> and other smaller media organizations for unflattering coverage.</p>
<p>In a $10 billion lawsuit against 60 Minutes and its parent <strong>Paramount</strong>, Trump claims they selectively edited an interview with former <strong>Vice President Kamala Harris</strong> prior to the 2024 election. The TV news show last month published transcripts of the interview at the heart of the dispute, but Paramount is <a href="https://apnews.com/article/cbs-60-minutes-lawsuit-trump-pelley-58339cc1a1eb52739bb365e2e8c6d8bc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly considering a settlement</a> to avoid potentially damaging its chances of winning the administration&#8217;s approval for a pending multibillion-dollar merger.</p>
<p>The president <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/crime-and-courts/2025/02/25/dismissal-sought-donald-trump-lawsuit-pollster-ann-selzer-des-moines-register-iowa-poll/79442387007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued The Des Moines Register</a> and its parent company, <strong>Gannett</strong>, for publishing a poll showing Trump trailing Harris in the 2024 presidential election in Iowa (a state that went for Trump). The POTUS also is <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/21/trump-libel-suit-pulitzer-prize-00169975" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suing the Pulitzer Prize board</a> over 2018 awards given to The New York Times and The Washington Post for their coverage of purported Russian interference in the 2016 election.</p>
<p>Whether or not any of the president&#8217;s lawsuits against news organizations have merit or succeed is almost beside the point. The strategy behind suing the media is to make reporters and newsrooms think twice about criticizing or challenging the president and his administration. The president also knows some media outlets will find it more expedient to settle.</p>
<p>Trump also sued <strong>ABC News</strong> and <strong>George Stephanopoulos</strong> for stating that the president had been found liable for &#8220;rape&#8221; in a civil case [Trump was found liable of sexually abusing and defaming E. Jean Carroll]. ABC parent <strong>Disney</strong> settled that claim by agreeing to donate $15 million to the Trump Presidential Library.</p>
<p>Following the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, <strong>Facebook</strong> blocked President Trump&#8217;s account. Trump sued <strong>Meta</strong>, and after the president&#8217;s victory in 2024 Meta <a class="sc-19cc8fd2-0 kspHIT" href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/trump-signs-agreement-calling-for-meta-to-pay-25-million-to-settle-suit-6f734c8c?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/trump-signs-agreement-calling-for-meta-to-pay-25-million-to-settle-suit-6f734c8c?mod=article_inline">settled</a> and agreed to pay Trump $25 million: $22 million would go to his presidential library, and the rest to legal fees. <strong>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg</strong> also announced Facebook and Instagram would <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/07/tech/meta-censorship-moderation/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get rid of fact-checkers</a> and rely instead on reader-submitted &#8220;community notes&#8221; to debunk disinformation on the social media platform.</p>
<p><strong>Brendan Carr</strong>, the president&#8217;s pick to run the <strong>Federal Communications Commission</strong> (FCC), has pledged to &#8220;dismantle the censorship cartel and restore free speech rights for everyday Americans.&#8221; But on January 22, 2025, the FCC reopened complaints against ABC, <strong>CBS</strong> and <strong>NBC</strong> over their coverage of the 2024 election. The previous FCC chair had dismissed the complaints as attacks on the First Amendment and an attempt to weaponize the agency for political purposes.</p>
<p>According to Reuters, the complaints call for an investigation into how ABC News moderated the pre-election TV debate between Trump and Biden, and appearances of then-Vice President Harris on 60 Minutes and on NBC&#8217;s &#8220;Saturday Night Live.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since then, the FCC has opened investigations into <strong>NPR</strong> and <strong>PBS</strong>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/30/nx-s1-5281162/fcc-npr-pbs-investigation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alleging</a> that they are breaking sponsorship rules. The <strong>Center for Democracy &amp; Technology </strong>(CDT), a think tank based in Washington, D.C., <a href="https://cdt.org/insights/when-it-comes-to-free-speech-the-trump-administration-should-follow-its-own-order/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted</a> that the FCC is also investigating <strong>KCBS</strong> in San Francisco for reporting on the location of federal immigration authorities.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if these investigations are ultimately closed without action, the mere fact of opening them – and the implicit threat to the news stations’ license to operate – can have the effect of deterring the press from news coverage that the Administration dislikes,&#8221; the CDT&#8217;s <strong>Kate Ruane</strong> observed.</p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly threatened to &#8220;open up&#8221; libel laws, with the goal of making it easier to sue media organizations for unfavorable coverage. But this week, the U.S. Supreme Court <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/supreme-court-thwarts-trump-dream-of-opening-up-libel-laws.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declined to hear a challenge</a> brought by Trump donor and Las Vegas casino magnate Steve Wynn to overturn the landmark 1964 decision in <em>New York Times v. Sullivan</em>, which insulates the press from libel suits over good-faith criticism of public figures.</p>
<p>The president also has insisted on picking which reporters and news outlets should be allowed to cover White House events and participate in the press pool that trails the president. He barred the <strong>Associated Press</strong> from the White House and Air Force One over their refusal to call the Gulf of Mexico by another name.</p>
<p>And the Defense Department has ordered a number of top media outlets <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/pentagon-doubles-number-news-outlets-rotate-out-office-spaces-2025-02-08/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to vacate their spots at the Pentagon</a>, including CNN, The Hill, The Washington Post, The New York Times, NBC News, Politico and National Public Radio.</p>
<p>&#8220;Incoming media outlets include the New York Post, Breitbart, the Washington Examiner, the Free Press, the Daily Caller, Newsmax, the Huffington Post and One America News Network, most of whom are seen as conservative or favoring Republican President Donald Trump,&#8221; Reuters reported.</p>
<h2>FREEDOM OF SPEECH</h2>
<p>Shortly after Trump took office again in January 2025, the administration began circulating <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/07/us/trump-federal-agencies-websites-words-dei.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lists of hundreds of words</a> that government staff and agencies shall not use in their reports and communications.</p>
<p>The Brookings Institution <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-us-government-data-purge-is-a-loss-for-policymaking-and-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notes</a> that in moving to comply with this anti-speech directive, federal agencies have purged countless taxpayer-funded data sets from a swathe of government websites, including data on crime, sexual orientation, gender, education, climate, and global development.</p>
<p><strong>The New York Times</strong> reports that in the past two months, hundreds of terabytes of digital resources analyzing data have been taken off government websites.</p>
<p>&#8220;While in many cases the underlying data still exists, the tools that make it possible for the public and researchers to use that data have been removed,&#8221; The Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/climate/government-websites-climate-environment-data.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>.</p>
<p>On Jan. 27, Trump issued <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/deb7af80-48b6-4b8a-8bfa-3d84fd7c3ec8.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a memo</a> (PDF) that paused all federally funded programs pending a review of those programs for alignment with the administration&#8217;s priorities. Among those was ensuring that no funding goes toward advancing &#8220;Marxist equity, transgenderism, and green new deal social engineering policies.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the CDT, this order is a blatant attempt to force government grantees to cease engaging in speech that the current administration dislikes, including speech about the benefits of diversity, climate change, and LGBTQ issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;The First Amendment does not permit the government to discriminate against grantees because it does not like some of the viewpoints they espouse,&#8221; the CDT&#8217;s Ruane wrote. &#8220;Indeed, those groups that are challenging the constitutionality of the order argued as much in their complaint, and have won an injunction blocking its implementation.&#8221;</p>
<p>On January 20, the same day Trump issued an executive order on free speech, the president also issued an executive order titled “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/reevaluating-and-realigning-united-states-foreign-aid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid</a>,” which froze funding for programs run by the <strong>U.S. Agency for International Development</strong> (USAID). Among those were programs designed to empower civil society and human rights groups, journalists and others responding to digital repression and Internet shutdowns.</p>
<p>According to the <strong>Electronic Frontier Foundation</strong> (EFF), this includes many freedom technologies that use cryptography, fight censorship, protect freedom of speech, privacy and anonymity for millions of people around the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;While the State Department has issued some limited waivers, so far those waivers do not seem to cover the open source internet freedom technologies,&#8221; the EFF <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/01/executive-order-state-department-sideswipes-freedom-tools-threatens-censorship" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> about the USAID disruptions. &#8220;As a result, many of these projects have to stop or severely curtail their work, lay off talented workers, and stop or slow further development.&#8221;</p>
<p>On March 14, the president signed <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/continuing-the-reduction-of-the-federal-bureaucracy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another executive order</a> that effectively gutted the <strong>U.S. Agency for Global Media</strong> (USAGM), which oversees or funds media outlets including <strong>Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty</strong> and <strong>Voice of America</strong> (VOA). The USAGM also oversees <strong>Radio Free Asia</strong>, which supporters say has been one of the most reliable tools used by the government to combat Chinese propaganda.</p>
<p>But this week, <strong>U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth</strong>, a Reagan appointee, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/26/nx-s1-5341321/trump-radio-free-europe-radio-liberty-restraining-order" target="_blank" rel="noopener">temporarily blocked USAGM&#8217;s closure</a> by the administration.</p>
<p>“RFE/RL has, for decades, operated as one of the organizations that Congress has statutorily designated to carry out this policy,” Lamberth <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.278524/gov.uscourts.dcd.278524.14.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote in a 10-page opinion</a>. “The leadership of USAGM cannot, with one sentence of reasoning offering virtually no explanation, force RFE/RL to shut down — even if the President has told them to do so.”</p>
<h2>FREEDOM OF RELIGION</h2>
<p>The Trump administration <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/01/21/statement-dhs-spokesperson-directives-expanding-law-enforcement-and-ending-abuse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rescinded a decades-old policy</a> that instructed officers not to take immigration enforcement actions in or near &#8220;sensitive&#8221; or &#8220;protected&#8221; places, such as churches, schools, and hospitals.</p>
<p>That directive was immediately challenged in a case brought by a group of Quakers, Baptists and Sikhs, who argued the policy reversal was keeping people from attending services for fear of being arrested on civil immigration violations. On Feb. 24, a federal judge agreed and <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/02/24/judge-blocks-immigration-enforcement-churches/80043880007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blocked</a> ICE agents from entering churches or targeting migrants nearby.</p>
<p>The president&#8217;s executive order allegedly addressing antisemitism came with <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-takes-forceful-and-unprecedented-steps-to-combat-anti-semitism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a fact sheet</a> that described college campuses as &#8220;infested&#8221; with &#8220;terrorists&#8221; and &#8220;jihadists.&#8221; Multiple faith groups expressed alarm over the order, saying it attempts to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/20/nx-s1-5326047/kenneth-stern-antimsietim-executive-order-free-speech" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weaponize antisemitism</a> and promote &#8220;<a href="https://www.ucc.org/faith-that-calls-for-welcome-confronts-the-harshest-anti-immigrant-policies-in-modern-u-s-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dehumanizing anti-immigrant policies.</a>&#8221;</p>
<p>The president also <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-national-prayer-breakfast-30ff6f55a2e3c7b8643a15e7b158537d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the creation of a &#8220;Task Force to Eradicate Anti-Christian Bias,&#8221; to be led by Attorney General Pam Bondi. Never mind that Christianity is easily the largest faith in America and that Christians are well-represented in Congress.</p>
<p>The <strong>Rev. Paul Brandeis Raushenbush</strong>, a Baptist minister and head of the progressive <strong>Interfaith Alliance</strong>, issued a statement accusing Trump of hypocrisy in claiming to champion religion by creating the task force.</p>
<p>“From allowing immigration raids in churches, to targeting faith-based charities, to suppressing religious diversity, the Trump Administration’s aggressive government overreach is infringing on religious freedom in a way we haven’t seen for generations,” Raushenbush said.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.au.org/the-latest/press/task-force-anti-christian-bias-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a> from <strong>Americans United for Separation of Church and State</strong> said the task force could lead to religious persecution of those with other faiths.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather than protecting religious beliefs, this task force will misuse religious freedom to justify bigotry, discrimination, and the subversion of our civil rights laws,&#8221; said Rachel Laser, the group&#8217;s president and CEO.</p>
<p>Where is President Trump going with all these blatant attacks on the First Amendment? The president has made no secret of his affection for autocratic leaders and &#8220;strongmen&#8221; around the world, and he is particularly enamored with Hungary&#8217;s far-right <strong>Prime Minister Viktor Orbán</strong>, who has visited Trump&#8217;s Mar-a-Lago resort twice in the past year.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/03/trumps-press-freedom-hungary-orban/682060/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">March 15 essay</a> in The Atlantic by Hungarian investigative journalist <strong>András Pethő</strong> recounts how Orbán rose to power by consolidating control over the courts, and by building his own media universe while simultaneously placing a stranglehold on the independent press.</p>
<p>&#8220;As I watch from afar what’s happening to the free press in the United States during the first weeks of Trump’s second presidency — the verbal bullying, the legal harassment, the buckling by media owners in the face of threats — it all looks very familiar,&#8221; Pethő wrote. &#8220;The MAGA authorities have learned Orbán’s lessons well.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many successful phishing attacks result in a financial loss or malware infection. But falling for some phishing scams, like those currently targeting Russians searching online for organizations that are fighting the Kremlin war machine, can cost you your freedom or your life.</p>
<div id="attachment_70811" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-70811" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-70811" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/legionlibertyarmy.png" alt="" width="750" height="420" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/legionlibertyarmy.png 1430w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/legionlibertyarmy-768x430.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/legionlibertyarmy-782x437.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><p id="caption-attachment-70811" class="wp-caption-text">The real website of the Ukrainian paramilitary group &#8220;Freedom of Russia&#8221; legion. The text has been machine-translated from Russian.</p></div>
<p>Researchers at the security firm <strong>Silent Push</strong> mapped a network of several dozen phishing domains that spoof the recruitment websites of Ukrainian paramilitary groups, as well as Ukrainian government intelligence sites.</p>
<p>The website <strong>legiohliberty[.]army</strong> features a carbon copy of the homepage for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_Russia_Legion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Freedom of Russia Legion</a> (a.k.a. &#8220;Free Russia Legion&#8221;), a three-year-old Ukraine-based paramilitary unit made up of Russian citizens who oppose Vladimir Putin and his invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>The phony version of that website copies the legitimate site &#8212; <strong>legionliberty[.]army &#8212; </strong>providing an interactive <strong>Google Form</strong> where interested applicants can share their contact and personal details. The form asks visitors to provide their name, gender, age, email address and/or Telegram handle, country, citizenship, experience in the armed forces; political views; motivations for joining; and any bad habits.</p>
<p>&#8220;Participation in such anti-war actions is considered illegal in the Russian Federation, and participating citizens are regularly charged and arrested,&#8221; Silent Push wrote in a report released today. &#8220;All observed campaigns had similar traits and shared a common objective: collecting personal information from site-visiting victims. Our team believes it is likely that this campaign is the work of either Russian Intelligence Services or a threat actor with similarly aligned motives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Silent Push&#8217;s <strong>Zach Edwards</strong> said the fake Legion Liberty site shared multiple connections with <strong>rusvolcorps[.]net</strong>. That domain mimics the recruitment page for a Ukrainian far-right paramilitary group called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Volunteer_Corps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Russian Volunteer Corps</a> (rusvolcorps[.]com), and uses a similar Google Forms page to collect information from would-be members.</p>
<p>Other domains Silent Push connected to the phishing scheme include: <strong>ciagov[.]icu</strong>, which mirrors the content on the official website of the <strong>U.S. Central Intelligence Agency</strong>; and <strong>hochuzhitlife[.]com</strong>, which spoofs the <strong>Ministry of Defense of Ukraine &amp; General Directorate of Intelligence</strong> (whose actual domain is <strong>hochuzhit[.]com</strong>).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-70814" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/recruit-form.png" alt="" width="749" height="775" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/recruit-form.png 790w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/recruit-form-768x794.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/recruit-form-782x809.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" /></p>
<p>According to Edwards, there are no signs that these phishing sites are being advertised via email. Rather, it appears those responsible are promoting them by manipulating the search engine results shown when someone searches for one of these anti-Putin organizations.</p>
<p>In August 2024, security researcher <strong>Artem Tamoian</strong> posted <a href="https://x.com/artemtam" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Twitter/X</a> about how he received startlingly different results when he searched for &#8220;Freedom of Russia legion&#8221; in Russia&#8217;s largest domestic search engine <strong>Yandex</strong> versus Google.com. The top result returned by Google was the legion&#8217;s actual website, while the first result on Yandex was a phishing page targeting the group.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think at least some of them are surely promoted via search,&#8221; Tamoian said of the phishing domains. &#8220;My first thread on that accuses Yandex, but apart from Yandex those websites are consistently ranked above legitimate in DuckDuckGo and Bing. Initially, I didn&#8217;t realize the scale of it. They keep appearing to this day.&#8221;<span id="more-70785"></span></p>
<p>Tamoian, a native Russian who left the country in 2019, is the founder of the cyber investigation platform <a href="https://malfors.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">malfors.com</a>. He recently discovered two other sites impersonating the Ukrainian paramilitary groups &#8212; <strong>legionliberty[.]world</strong> and <strong>rusvolcorps[.]ru</strong> &#8212; and reported both to Cloudflare. When Cloudflare responded by blocking the sites with a phishing warning, the real Internet address of these sites <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rusvolcorps-stark.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was exposed</a> as belonging to a known &#8220;bulletproof hosting&#8221; network called <strong>Stark Industries Solutions Ltd</strong>.</p>
<p>Stark Industries Solutions appeared two weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, materializing out of nowhere with hundreds of thousands of Internet addresses in its stable &#8212; many of them originally assigned to Russian government organizations. In May 2024, KrebsOnSecurity <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/05/stark-industries-solutions-an-iron-hammer-in-the-cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published a deep dive on Stark</a>, which has repeatedly been used to host infrastructure for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, phishing, malware and disinformation campaigns from Russian intelligence agencies and pro-Kremlin hacker groups.</p>
<p>In March 2023, Russia’s Supreme Court designated the Freedom of Russia legion as a terrorist organization, meaning that Russians caught communicating with the group could face between 10 and 20 years in prison.</p>
<p>Tamoian said those searching online for information about these paramilitary groups have become easy prey for Russian security services.</p>
<p>&#8220;I started looking into those phishing websites, because I kept stumbling upon news that someone gets arrested for trying to join [the] Ukrainian Army or for trying to help them,&#8221; Tamoian told KrebsOnSecurity. &#8220;I have also seen reports [of] FSB contacting people impersonating Ukrainian officers, as well as using fake Telegram bots, so I thought fake websites might be an option as well.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_70810" style="width: 622px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-70810" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-70810" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/legion-arrests.png" alt="" width="612" height="802" /><p id="caption-attachment-70810" class="wp-caption-text">Search results showing news articles about people in Russia being sentenced to lengthy prison terms for attempting to aid Ukrainian paramilitary groups.</p></div>
<p>Tamoian said <a href="https://en.zona.media/article/2024/10/15/phish-trl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports surface regularly in Russia</a> about people being arrested for trying carry out an action requested by a &#8220;Ukrainian recruiter,&#8221; with the courts unfailingly imposing harsh sentences regardless of the defendant’s age.</p>
<p>&#8220;This keeps happening regularly, but usually there are no details about how exactly the person gets caught,&#8221; he said. &#8220;All cases related to state treason [and] terrorism are classified, so there are barely any details.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tamoian said while he has no direct evidence linking any of the reported arrests and convictions to these phishing sites, he is certain the sites are part of a larger campaign by the Russian government.</p>
<p>&#8220;Considering that they keep them alive and keep spawning more, I assume it might be an efficient thing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They are on top of DuckDuckGo and Yandex, so it unfortunately works.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Authorities in at least two U.S. states last week independently announced arrests of Chinese nationals accused of perpetrating a novel form of tap-to-pay fraud using mobile devices. Details released by authorities so far indicate the mobile wallets being used by the scammers were created through online phishing scams, and that the accused were relying on a custom Android app to relay tap-to-pay transactions from mobile devices located in China.</p>
<div id="attachment_70773" style="width: 758px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-70773" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-70773" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/kcso-taptopay.png" alt="" width="748" height="413" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/kcso-taptopay.png 903w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/kcso-taptopay-768x424.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/kcso-taptopay-782x431.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px" /><p id="caption-attachment-70773" class="wp-caption-text">Image: WLVT-8.</p></div>
<p>Authorities in Knoxville, Tennessee last week <a href="https://knoxsheriff.org/tap-2-pay-fraud-scheme-bust/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> they arrested 11 Chinese nationals accused of buying tens of thousands of dollars worth of gift cards at local retailers with mobile wallets created through online phishing scams. The Knox County Sheriff&#8217;s office said the arrests are considered the first in the nation for a new type of tap-to-pay fraud.</p>
<p>Responding to questions about what makes this scheme so remarkable, Knox County said that while it appears the fraudsters are simply buying gift cards, in fact they are using multiple transactions to purchase various gift cards and are plying their scam from state to state.</p>
<p>&#8220;These offenders have been traveling nationwide, using stolen credit card information to purchase gift cards and launder funds,&#8221; Knox County Chief Deputy <strong>Bernie Lyon</strong> wrote. &#8220;During Monday’s operation, we recovered gift cards valued at over $23,000, all bought with unsuspecting victims’ information.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked for specifics about the mobile devices seized from the suspects, Lyon said &#8220;tap-to-pay fraud involves a group <em>utilizing Android phones to conduct Apple Pay transactions</em> utilizing stolen or compromised credit/debit card information,&#8221; [emphasis added].</p>
<p>Lyon declined to offer additional specifics about the mechanics of the scam, citing an ongoing investigation.</p>
<p><strong>Ford Merrill</strong> works in security research at <a href="https://www.secalliance.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SecAlliance</a>, a <a href="https://www.csis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CSIS Security Group</a> company. Merrill said there aren&#8217;t many valid use cases for Android phones to transmit Apple Pay transactions. That is, he said, unless they are running a custom Android app that KrebsOnSecurity wrote about last month as part of <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/02/how-phished-data-turns-into-apple-google-wallets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a deep dive into the operations of China-based phishing cartels</a> that are breathing new life into the payment card fraud industry (a.k.a. &#8220;carding&#8221;).</p>
<p>How are these China-based phishing groups obtaining stolen payment card data and then loading it onto Google and Apple phones? It all starts with phishing.</p>
<p>If you own a mobile phone, the chances are excellent that at some point in the past two years it has received at least one phishing message that spoofs the <strong>U.S. Postal Service</strong> to supposedly collect some outstanding delivery fee, or an SMS that pretends to be a local toll road operator warning of a delinquent toll fee.</p>
<p>These messages are being sent through sophisticated phishing kits sold by several cybercriminals based in mainland China. And they are not traditional SMS phishing or “<strong>smishing</strong>” messages, as they bypass the mobile networks entirely. Rather, the missives are sent through the <strong>Apple iMessage</strong> service and through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Communication_Services" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RCS</a>, the functionally equivalent technology on <strong>Google</strong> phones.</p>
<p>People who enter their payment card data at one of these sites will be told their financial institution needs to verify the small transaction by sending a one-time passcode to the customer’s mobile device. In reality, that code will be sent by the victim’s financial institution in response to a request by the fraudsters to link the phished card data to a mobile wallet.</p>
<p>If the victim then provides that one-time code, the phishers will link the card data to a new mobile wallet from Apple or Google, loading the wallet onto a mobile phone that the scammers control. These phones are then loaded with multiple stolen wallets (often between 5-10 per device) and sold in bulk to scammers on Telegram.</p>

<p>Merrill found that at least one of the Chinese phishing groups sells an Android app called “<strong>Z-NFC</strong>” that can relay a valid NFC transaction to anywhere in the world. The user simply waves their phone at a local payment terminal that accepts Apple or Google pay, and the app relays an NFC transaction over the Internet from a phone in China.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would be shocked if this wasn&#8217;t the NFC relay app,&#8221; Merrill said, concerning the arrested suspects in Tennessee.</p>

<p>Merrill said the Z-NFC software can work from anywhere in the world, and that one phishing gang offers the software for $500 a month.</p>
<p>&#8220;It can relay both NFC enabled tap-to-pay as well as any digital wallet,&#8221; Merrill said. &#8220;They even have 24-hour support.&#8221;<span id="more-70697"></span></p>
<p>On March 16, the ABC affiliate in Sacramento (<strong>ABC10</strong>), Calif. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUjaj0d1T6A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aired a segment</a> about two Chinese nationals who were arrested after using an app to run stolen credit cards at a local Target store. The news story quoted investigators saying the men were trying to buy gift cards using a mobile app that cycled through more than 80 stolen payment cards.</p>
<p>ABC10 reported that while most of those transactions were declined, the suspects still made off with $1,400 worth of gift cards. After their arrests, both men reportedly admitted that they were being paid $250 a day to conduct the fraudulent transactions.</p>
<p>Merrill said it&#8217;s not unusual for fraud groups to advertise this kind of work on social media networks, including TikTok.</p>
<p>A <strong>CBS News</strong> <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sacramento/news/sacramento-county-credit-card-scheme-arrest-chinese-nationals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">story</a> on the Sacramento arrests said one of the suspects tried to use 42 separate bank cards, but that 32 were declined. Even so, the man still was reportedly able to spend $855 in the transactions.</p>
<p>Likewise, the suspect&#8217;s alleged accomplice tried 48 transactions on separate cards, finding success 11 times and spending $633, CBS reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s interesting that so many of the cards were declined,&#8221; Merrill said. &#8220;One reason this might be is that banks are getting better at detecting this type of fraud. The other could be that the cards were already used and so they were already flagged for fraud even before these guys had a chance to use them. So there could be some element of just sending these guys out to stores to see if it works, and if not they&#8217;re on their own.&#8221;</p>
<p>Merrill&#8217;s investigation into the Telegram sales channels for these China-based phishing gangs shows their phishing sites are actively manned by fraudsters who sit in front of giant racks of Apple and Google phones that are used to send the spam and respond to replies in real time.</p>
<p>In other words, the phishing websites are powered by real human operators as long as new messages are being sent. Merrill said the criminals appear to send only a few dozen messages at a time, likely because completing the scam takes manual work by the human operators in China. After all, most one-time codes used for mobile wallet provisioning are generally only good for a few minutes before they expire.</p>
