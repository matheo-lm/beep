										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. government today unsealed criminal charges against 16 individuals accused of operating and selling <strong>DanaBot</strong>, a prolific strain of information-stealing malware that has been sold on Russian cybercrime forums since 2018. The <strong>FBI</strong> says a newer version of DanaBot was used for espionage, and that many of the defendants exposed their real-life identities after accidentally infecting their own systems with the malware.</p>
<div id="attachment_71354" style="width: 759px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71354" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-71354" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/danabot.png" alt="" width="749" height="650" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/danabot.png 817w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/danabot-768x666.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/danabot-782x679.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" /><p id="caption-attachment-71354" class="wp-caption-text">DanaBot&#8217;s features, as promoted on its support site. Image: welivesecurity.com.</p></div>
<p>Initially <a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/danabot-new-banking-trojan-surfaces-down-under-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> in May 2018 by researchers at the email security firm <strong>Proofpoint</strong>, DanaBot is a malware-as-a-service platform that specializes in credential theft and banking fraud.</p>
<p>Today, the <strong>U.S. Department of Justice</strong> unsealed a criminal complaint and indictment from 2022, which said the FBI identified at least 40 affiliates who were paying between $3,000 and $4,000 a month for access to the information stealer platform.</p>
<p>The government says the malware infected more than 300,000 systems globally, causing estimated losses of more than $50 million. The ringleaders of the DanaBot conspiracy are named as <strong>Aleksandr Stepanov</strong>, 39, a.k.a. “<strong>JimmBee</strong>,” and <strong>Artem Aleksandrovich Kalinkin</strong>, 34, a.k.a. “<strong>Onix</strong>”, both of Novosibirsk, Russia. Kalinkin is an IT engineer for the Russian state-owned energy giant <strong>Gazprom</strong>. His Facebook profile name is &#8220;Maffiozi.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the FBI, there were at least two major versions of DanaBot; the first was sold between 2018 and June 2020, when the malware stopped being offered on Russian cybercrime forums. The government alleges that the second version of DanaBot &#8212; emerging in January 2021 &#8212; was provided to co-conspirators for use in targeting military, diplomatic and non-governmental organization computers in several countries, including the United States, Belarus, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Russia.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unindicted co-conspirators would use the Espionage Variant to compromise computers around the world and steal sensitive diplomatic communications, credentials, and other data from these targeted victims,&#8221; reads a grand jury indictment dated Sept. 20, 2022. &#8220;This stolen data included financial transactions by diplomatic staff, correspondence concerning day-to-day diplomatic activity, as well as summaries of a particular country&#8217;s interactions with the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p>The indictment says the FBI in 2022 seized servers used by the DanaBot authors to control their malware, as well as the servers that stored stolen victim data. The government said the server data also show numerous instances in which the DanaBot defendants infected their own PCs, resulting in their credential data being uploaded to stolen data repositories that were seized by the feds.</p>
<p>&#8220;In some cases, such self-infections appeared to be deliberately done in order to test, analyze, or improve the malware,&#8221; the criminal complaint reads. &#8220;In other cases, the infections seemed to be inadvertent &#8211; one of the hazards of committing cybercrime is that criminals will sometimes infect themselves with their own malware by mistake.&#8221;<span id="more-71351"></span></p>
<div id="attachment_71359" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71359" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-71359" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/eset-danabotmap.png" alt="" width="750" height="479" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/eset-danabotmap.png 846w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/eset-danabotmap-768x490.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/eset-danabotmap-782x499.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><p id="caption-attachment-71359" class="wp-caption-text">Image: welivesecurity.com</p></div>
<p>A <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/16-defendants-federally-charged-connection-danabot-malware-scheme-infected-computers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a> from the DOJ says that as part of today&#8217;s operation, agents with the <strong>Defense Criminal Investigative Service</strong> (DCIS) seized the DanaBot control servers, including dozens of virtual servers hosted in the United States. The government says it is now working with industry partners to notify DanaBot victims and help remediate infections. The statement credits a number of security firms with providing assistance to the government, including <strong>ESET</strong>, <strong>Flashpoint</strong>, <strong>Google</strong>, <strong>Intel 471</strong>, <strong>Lumen</strong>, <strong>PayPal</strong>, <strong>Proofpoint</strong>, <strong>Team CYMRU</strong>, and <strong>ZScaler</strong>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not unheard of for financially-oriented malicious software to be repurposed for espionage. A variant of the <strong>ZeuS Trojan</strong>, which was used in countless online banking attacks against companies in the United States and Europe between 2007 and at least 2015, was for a time diverted to espionage tasks by its author.</p>
<p>As detailed <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/08/inside-the-100m-business-club-crime-gang/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in this 2015 story,</a> the author of the ZeuS trojan created a custom version of the malware to serve purely as a spying machine, which scoured infected systems in Ukraine for specific keywords in emails and documents that would likely only be found in classified documents.</p>
<p>The public charging of the 16 DanaBot defendants comes a day after <strong>Microsoft</strong> <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/05/21/lumma-stealer-breaking-down-the-delivery-techniques-and-capabilities-of-a-prolific-infostealer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joined</a> a slew of tech companies in <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-seizes-domains-behind-major-information-stealing-malware-operation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disrupting the IT infrastructure</a> for another malware-as-a-service offering &#8212; <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/eset-takes-part-global-operation-disrupt-lumma-stealer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lumma Stealer</a>, which is likewise offered to affiliates under tiered subscription prices ranging from $250 to $1,000 per month. Separately, Microsoft filed a civil lawsuit to seize control over 2,300 domain names used by Lumma Stealer and its affiliates.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>KrebsOnSecurity last week was hit by a near record distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack that clocked in at more than 6.3 terabits of data per second (a terabit is one trillion bits of data). The brief attack appears to have been a test run for a massive new Internet of Things (IoT) botnet capable of launching crippling digital assaults that few web destinations can withstand. Read on for more about the botnet, the attack, and the apparent creator of this global menace.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-71312" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ddosbomb.png" alt="" width="661" height="542" /></p>
<p>For reference, the 6.3 Tbps attack last week was ten times the size of the assault launched against this site in 2016 by the <strong>Mirai</strong> IoT botnet, which <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/the-democratization-of-censorship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">held KrebsOnSecurity offline for nearly four days</a>. The 2016 assault was so large that <strong>Akamai</strong> &#8211; which was providing pro-bono DDoS protection for KrebsOnSecurity at the time &#8212; asked me to leave their service because the attack was causing problems for their paying customers.</p>
<p>Since the Mirai attack, KrebsOnSecurity.com has been behind the protection of <strong>Project Shield</strong>, a free DDoS defense service that <strong>Google</strong> provides to websites offering news, human rights, and election-related content. Google Security Engineer <strong>Damian Menscher</strong> told KrebsOnSecurity the May 12 attack was the largest Google has ever handled. In terms of sheer size, it is second only to a very similar attack that <strong>Cloudflare</strong> mitigated and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/ddos-threat-report-for-2025-q1/#hyper-volumetric-attacks-continue-spill-into-q2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote about in April</a>.</p>
<p>After comparing notes with Cloudflare, Menscher said the botnet that launched both attacks bears the fingerprints of <strong>Aisuru</strong>, a digital siege machine that first surfaced less than a year ago. Menscher said the attack on KrebsOnSecurity lasted less than a minute, hurling <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-best-practices-ddos-resiliency/udp-reflection-attacks.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large UDP data packets</a> at random ports <em>at a rate of approximately 585 million data packets per second</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was the type of attack normally designed to overwhelm network links,&#8221; Menscher said, referring to the throughput connections between and among various Internet service providers (ISPs). &#8220;For most companies, this size of attack would kill them.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_71311" style="width: 759px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cf-6.5ddos.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71311" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-71311" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cf-6.5ddos.png" alt="" width="749" height="340" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cf-6.5ddos.png 906w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cf-6.5ddos-768x348.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cf-6.5ddos-782x355.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-71311" class="wp-caption-text">A graph depicting the 6.5 Tbps attack mitigated by Cloudflare in April 2025. Image: Cloudflare.</p></div>
<p>The Aisuru botnet comprises a globally-dispersed collection of hacked IoT devices, including routers, digital video recorders and other systems that are commandeered via default passwords or software vulnerabilities. As <a href="https://blog.xlab.qianxin.com/large-scale-botnet-airashi-en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documented</a> by researchers at <strong>QiAnXin XLab</strong>, the botnet was first identified in an August 2024 attack on a large gaming platform.</p>
<p>Aisuru reportedly went quiet after that exposure, only to reappear in November with even more firepower and software exploits. In a <a href="https://blog.xlab.qianxin.com/large-scale-botnet-airashi-en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January 2025 report</a>, XLab found the new and improved Aisuru (a.k.a. &#8220;<strong>Airashi</strong>&#8220;) had incorporated a previously unknown zero-day vulnerability in Cambium Networks cnPilot routers.</p>
<h2>NOT FORKING AROUND</h2>
<p>The people behind the Aisuru botnet have been peddling access to their DDoS machine in public <strong>Telegram</strong> chat channels that are closely monitored by multiple security firms. In August 2024, the botnet was rented out in subscription tiers ranging from $150 per day to $600 per week, offering attacks of up to two terabits per second.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may not attack any measurement walls, healthcare facilities, schools or government sites,&#8221; read a notice posted on Telegram by the Aisuru botnet owners in August 2024.</p>
<p>Interested parties were told to contact the Telegram handle &#8220;<strong>@yfork</strong>&#8221; to purchase a subscription. The account @yfork previously used the nickname &#8220;<strong>Forky</strong>,&#8221; an identity that has been posting to public DDoS-focused Telegram channels since 2021.</p>
<p>According to the FBI, Forky&#8217;s DDoS-for-hire domains have been seized in multiple law enforcement operations over the years. Last year, Forky said on Telegram he was selling the domain <strong>stresser[.]best</strong>, which saw its servers seized by the FBI in 2022 as part of an ongoing international law enforcement effort aimed at diminishing the supply of and demand for DDoS-for-hire services.</p>
<p>&#8220;The operator of this service, who calls himself &#8216;Forky,&#8217; operates a Telegram channel to advertise features and communicate with current and prospective DDoS customers,&#8221; reads <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Booter-seizure-warrant-Tucows-2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an FBI seizure warrant</a> (PDF) issued for stresser[.]best. The FBI warrant stated that on the same day the seizures were announced, Forky posted <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/12/six-charged-in-mass-takedown-of-ddos-for-hire-sites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a link to a story on this blog</a> that detailed the domain seizure operation, adding the comment, “We are buying our new domains right now.”</p>
<div id="attachment_71315" style="width: 758px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71315" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-71315" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/stresserbest.png" alt="" width="748" height="663" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/stresserbest.png 953w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/stresserbest-768x681.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/stresserbest-782x693.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px" /><p id="caption-attachment-71315" class="wp-caption-text">A screenshot from the FBI&#8217;s seizure warrant for Forky&#8217;s DDoS-for-hire domains shows Forky announcing the resurrection of their service at new domains.</p></div>
<p>Approximately ten hours later, Forky posted again, including a screenshot of the stresser[.]best user dashboard, instructing customers to use their saved passwords for the old website on the new one.</p>
<p>A review of Forky&#8217;s posts to public Telegram channels &#8212; as indexed by the cyber intelligence firms <strong>Unit 221B</strong> and <strong>Flashpoint</strong> &#8212; reveals a 21-year-old individual who claims to reside in Brazil [full disclosure: Flashpoint is currently an advertiser on this blog].</p>
<p>Since late 2022, Forky&#8217;s posts have frequently promoted a DDoS mitigation company and ISP that he operates called <strong>botshield[.]io</strong>. The Botshield website is connected to a business entity registered in the United Kingdom called <a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/officers/krPZ3H9McgoRJbksmVWst3yc9G0/appointments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Botshield LTD</a>, which lists a 21-year-old woman from Sao Paulo, Brazil as the director. Internet routing records indicate Botshield (<a href="https://ipinfo.io/AS213613" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AS213613</a>) currently controls several hundred Internet addresses that were allocated to the company earlier this year.</p>
<p><strong>Domaintools.com</strong> reports that botshield[.]io was registered in July 2022 to a <strong>Kaike Southier Leite</strong> in Sao Paulo. A <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaike-southier-5074b82b6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn profile</a> by the same name says this individual is a network specialist from Brazil who works in &#8220;the planning and implementation of robust network infrastructures, with a focus on security, DDoS mitigation, colocation and cloud server services.&#8221;</p>
<h2>MEET FORKY</h2>
<div id="attachment_71314" style="width: 789px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71314" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-71314 size-full" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/forky.png" alt="" width="779" height="519" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/forky.png 779w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/forky-768x512.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 779px) 100vw, 779px" /><p id="caption-attachment-71314" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Jaclyn Vernace / Shutterstock.com.</p></div>
<p>In his posts to public Telegram chat channels, Forky has hardly attempted to conceal his whereabouts or identity. In countless chat conversations indexed by Unit 221B, Forky could be seen talking about everyday life in Brazil, often remarking on the extremely low or high prices in Brazil for a range of goods, from computer and networking gear to narcotics and food.</p>
<p>Reached via Telegram, Forky claimed he was &#8220;not involved in this type of illegal actions for years now,&#8221; and that the project had been taken over by other unspecified developers. Forky initially told KrebsOnSecurity he had been out of the botnet scene for years, only to concede this wasn&#8217;t true when presented with public posts on Telegram from late last year that clearly showed otherwise.</p>
<p>Forky denied being involved in the attack on KrebsOnSecurity, but acknowledged that he helped to develop and market the Aisuru botnet. Forky claims he is now merely a staff member for the Aisuru botnet team, and that he stopped running the botnet roughly two months ago after starting a family. Forky also said the woman named as director of Botshield is related to him.</p>
<p>Forky offered equivocal, evasive responses to a number of questions about the Aisuru botnet and his business endeavors. But on one point he was crystal clear:</p>
<p>&#8220;I have zero fear about you, the FBI, or Interpol,&#8221; Forky said, asserting that he is now almost entirely focused on their hosting business &#8212; Botshield.<span id="more-71303"></span></p>
<p>Forky declined to discuss the makeup of his ISP&#8217;s clientele, or to clarify whether Botshield was more of a hosting provider or a DDoS mitigation firm. However, Forky has posted on Telegram about Botshield successfully mitigating large DDoS attacks launched against other DDoS-for-hire services.</p>
<p>DomainTools finds the same Sao Paulo street address in the registration records for botshield[.]io was used to register several other domains, including <strong>cant-mitigate[.]us.</strong> The email address in the WHOIS records for that domain is forkcontato@gmail.com, which DomainTools says was used to register the domain for the now-defunct DDoS-for-hire service <strong>stresser[.]us</strong>, one of the domains seized in <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/05/feds-take-down-13-more-ddos-for-hire-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the FBI&#8217;s 2023 crackdown</a>.</p>
<p>On May 8, 2023, the <strong>U.S. Department of Justice</strong> <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/federal-authorities-seize-13-internet-domains-associated-booter-websites-offered-ddos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the seizure of stresser[.]us, along with a dozen other domains offering DDoS services. The DOJ said ten of the 13 domains were reincarnations of services that were seized during a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/federal-prosecutors-los-angeles-and-alaska-charge-6-defendants-operating-websites" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/federal-prosecutors-los-angeles-and-alaska-charge-6-defendants-operating-websites&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1747842233209000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0Tl0oBqaLrBCwcoLIjUEED">prior sweep in December</a>, which targeted 48 top stresser services (also known as &#8220;booters&#8221;).</p>
<p>Forky claimed he could find out who attacked my site with Aisuru. But when pressed a day later on the question, Forky said he&#8217;d come up empty-handed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tried to ask around, all the big guys are not retarded enough to attack you,&#8221; Forky explained in an interview on Telegram. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t have anything to do with it. But you are welcome to write the story and try to put the blame on me.&#8221;</p>
<h2>THE GHOST OF MIRAI</h2>
<p>The 6.3 Tbps attack last week caused no visible disruption to this site, in part because it was so brief &#8212; lasting approximately 45 seconds. DDoS attacks of such magnitude and brevity typically are produced when botnet operators wish to test or demonstrate their firepower for the benefit of potential buyers. Indeed, Google&#8217;s Menscher said it is likely that both the May 12 attack and the slightly larger 6.5 Tbps attack against Cloudflare last month were simply tests of the same botnet&#8217;s capabilities.</p>
<p>In many ways, the threat posed by the Aisuru/Airashi botnet is reminiscent of Mirai, an innovative IoT malware strain that emerged in the summer of 2016 and successfully out-competed virtually all other IoT malware strains in existence at the time.</p>
<p>As first revealed by KrebsOnSecurity in January 2017, the Mirai authors were <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/01/who-is-anna-senpai-the-mirai-worm-author/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two U.S. men who co-ran a DDoS mitigation service</a> &#8212; even as they were selling far more lucrative DDoS-for-hire services using the most powerful botnet on the planet.</p>
<p>Less than a week after the Mirai botnet was used in a days-long DDoS against KrebsOnSecurity, the Mirai authors <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/source-code-for-iot-botnet-mirai-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published the source code to their botnet</a> so that they would not be the only ones in possession of it in the event of their arrest by federal investigators.</p>
<p>Ironically, the leaking of the Mirai source is precisely what led to the eventual unmasking and arrest of the Mirai authors, who went on to serve probation sentences that <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mirai-untold-story-three-young-hackers-web-killing-monster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">required them to consult with FBI investigators on DDoS investigations</a>. But that leak also rapidly led to the creation of dozens of Mirai botnet clones, many of which were harnessed to fuel their own powerful DDoS-for-hire services.</p>
<p>Menscher told KrebsOnSecurity that as counterintuitive as it may sound, the Internet as a whole would probably be better off if the source code for Aisuru became public knowledge. After all, he said, the people behind Aisuru are in constant competition with other IoT botnet operators who are all striving to commandeer a finite number of vulnerable IoT devices globally.</p>
<p>Such a development would almost certainly cause a proliferation of Aisuru botnet clones, he said, but at least then the overall firepower from each individual botnet would be greatly diminished &#8212; or at least within range of the mitigation capabilities of most DDoS protection providers.</p>
<p>Barring a source code leak, Menscher said, it would be nice if someone published the full list of software exploits being used by the Aisuru operators to grow their botnet so quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Part of the reason Mirai was so dangerous was that it effectively took out competing botnets,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This attack somehow managed to compromise all these boxes that nobody else knows about. Ideally, we&#8217;d want to see that fragmented out, so that no [individual botnet operator] controls too much.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In what experts are calling a novel legal outcome, the 22-year-old former administrator of the cybercrime community <strong>Breachforums </strong>will forfeit nearly $700,000 to settle a civil lawsuit from a health insurance company whose customer data was posted for sale on the forum in 2023. <strong>Conor Brian Fitzpatrick</strong>, a.k.a. &#8220;<strong>Pompompurin</strong>,&#8221; is slated for resentencing next month after pleading guilty to access device fraud and possession of child sexual abuse material (CSAM).</p>
<div id="attachment_71274" style="width: 985px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71274" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-71274" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/breached-nonstop.png" alt="" width="975" height="364" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/breached-nonstop.png 975w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/breached-nonstop-768x287.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/breached-nonstop-782x292.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" /><p id="caption-attachment-71274" class="wp-caption-text">A redacted screenshot of the Breachforums sales thread. Image: Ke-la.com.</p></div>
<p>On January 18, 2023, denizens of Breachforums posted for sale tens of thousands of records &#8212; including Social Security numbers, dates of birth, addresses, and phone numbers  &#8212; stolen from <strong>Nonstop Health</strong>, an insurance provider based in Concord, Calif.</p>
<p>Class-action attorneys sued Nonstop Health, which added Fitzpatrick as a third-party defendant to the civil litigation in November 2023, several months after he was <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/03/feds-charge-ny-man-as-breachforums-boss-pompompurin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arrested by the FBI</a> and criminally charged with access device fraud and CSAM possession. In January 2025, Nonstop <a href="https://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/closed-settlements/1-6m-nonstop-administration-and-insurance-services-data-breach-class-action-settlement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agreed to pay $1.5 million</a> to settle the class action.</p>
<p><strong>Jill Fertel</strong> is a former prosecutor who runs the cyber litigation practice at <strong>Cipriani &amp; Werner</strong>, the law firm that represented Nonstop Health. Fertel told KrebsOnSecurity this is the first and only case where a cybercriminal or anyone related to the security incident was actually named in civil litigation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Civil plaintiffs are not at all likely to see money seized from threat actors involved in the incident to be made available to people impacted by the breach,&#8221; Fertel said. &#8220;The best we could do was make this money available to the class, but it&#8217;s still incumbent on the members of the class who are impacted to make that claim.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Mark Rasch</strong> is a former federal prosecutor who now represents <strong>Unit 221B</strong>, a cybersecurity firm based in New York City. Rasch said he doesn&#8217;t doubt that the civil settlement involving Fitzpatrick&#8217;s criminal activity is a novel legal development.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is rare in these civil cases that you know the threat actor involved in the breach, and it&#8217;s also rare that you catch them with sufficient resources to be able to pay a claim,&#8221; Rasch said.</p>
<p>Despite admitting to possessing more than 600 CSAM images and personally operating Breachforums, Fitzpatrick was <a href="https://cyberscoop.com/jailed-breachforums-creator-admin-sentenced-to-20-years-of-supervised-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sentenced in January 2024 to time served</a> and 20 years of supervised release. Federal prosecutors objected, arguing that his punishment failed to adequately reflect the seriousness of his crimes or serve as a deterrent.</p>
<div id="attachment_71269" style="width: 759px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71269" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-71269" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/pom-csam.png" alt="" width="749" height="299" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/pom-csam.png 789w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/pom-csam-768x307.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/pom-csam-782x312.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" /><p id="caption-attachment-71269" class="wp-caption-text">An excerpt from a pre-sentencing report for Fitzpatrick indicates he had more than 600 CSAM images on his devices.</p></div>
<p>Indeed, the same month he was sentenced Fitzpatrick <a href="https://dd80b675424c132b90b3-e48385e382d2e5d17821a5e1d8e4c86b.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/external/sdny-24mj003-waiver-jan22024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was rearrested</a> (PDF) for violating the terms of his release, which forbade him from using a computer that didn&#8217;t have court-required monitoring software installed.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors said Fitzpatrick went on Discord following his guilty plea and <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca4/24-4102/24-4102-2025-01-21.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">professed innocence</a> to the very crimes to which he&#8217;d pleaded guilty, stating that his plea deal was &#8220;so BS&#8221; and that he had &#8220;wanted to fight it.&#8221; The feds said Fitzpatrick also joked with his friends about selling data to foreign governments, exhorting one user to &#8220;become a foreign asset to china or russia,&#8221; and to &#8220;sell government secrets.&#8221;<span id="more-71263"></span></p>
<p>In January 2025, a federal appeals court agreed with the government&#8217;s assessment, <a href="https://cyberscoop.com/conor-fitzpatrick-resentenced-pompompurin-breachforums/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vacating Fitzpatrick&#8217;s sentence</a> and ordering him to be resentenced on June 3, 2025.</p>
<p>Fitzpatrick launched BreachForums in March 2022 to replace <strong>RaidForums</strong>, a similarly popular crime forum that was <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/04/raidforums-get-raided-alleged-admin-arrested/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infiltrated and shut down by the FBI</a> the previous month. As administrator, his alter ego Pompompurin served as the middleman, personally reviewing all databases for sale on the forum and offering an escrow service to those interested in buying stolen data.</p>
<div id="attachment_71270" style="width: 375px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71270" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-71270" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/conorfitzpatrick-yearbook.png" alt="" width="365" height="560" /><p id="caption-attachment-71270" class="wp-caption-text">A yearbook photo of Fitzpatrick unearthed by the Yonkers Times.</p></div>
<p>The new site quickly attracted more than 300,000 users, and facilitated the sale of databases stolen from hundreds of hacking victims, including some of the largest consumer data breaches in recent history. In May 2024, a reincarnation of Breachforums was seized by the FBI and international partners. Still more relaunches of the forum occurred after that, with <a href="https://socradar.io/breachforums-is-offline-a-new-twist-or-just-another-cyber-sheningan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the most recent disruption</a> last month.</p>
<p>As KrebsOnSecurity reported last year in <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/09/the-dark-nexus-between-harm-groups-and-the-com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Dark Nexus Between Harm Groups and The Com</a>, it is increasingly common for federal investigators to find CSAM material when searching devices seized from cybercriminal suspects. While the mere possession of CSAM is a serious federal crime, not all of those caught with CSAM are necessarily creators or distributors of it. Fertel said some cybercriminal communities have been known to require new entrants to share CSAM material as a way of proving that they are not a federal investigator.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re going to the darkest corners of Internet, that&#8217;s how you prove you&#8217;re not law enforcement,&#8221; Fertel said. &#8220;Law enforcement would never share that material. It would be criminal for me as a prosecutor, if I obtained and possessed those types of images.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Microsoft</strong> on Tuesday released software updates to fix at least 70 vulnerabilities in <strong>Windows</strong> and related products, including <em>five zero-day flaws that are already seeing active exploitation</em>. Adding to the sense of urgency with this month&#8217;s patch batch from Redmond are fixes for two other weaknesses that now have public proof-of-concept exploits available.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-60331" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/winupdatedate.png" alt="" width="749" height="496" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/winupdatedate.png 923w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/winupdatedate-768x508.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/winupdatedate-782x518.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" /></p>
<p>Microsoft and several security firms have disclosed that attackers are exploiting a pair of bugs in the <strong>Windows Common Log File System</strong> (CLFS) driver that allow attackers to elevate their privileges on a vulnerable device. The Windows CLFS is a critical Windows component responsible for logging services, and is widely used by Windows system services and third-party applications for logging. Tracked as <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-32701" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2025-32701</a> &amp; <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-32706" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2025-32706</a>, these flaws are present in all supported versions of Windows 10 and 11, as well as their server versions.</p>
<p><strong>Kev Breen</strong>, senior director of threat research at <strong>Immersive Labs</strong>, said privilege escalation bugs assume an attacker already has initial access to a compromised host, typically through a phishing attack or by using stolen credentials. But if that access already exists, Breen said, attackers can gain access to the much more powerful Windows SYSTEM account, which can disable security tooling or even gain domain administration level permissions using credential harvesting tools.</p>
<p>&#8220;The patch notes don&#8217;t provide technical details on how this is being exploited, and no Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) are shared, meaning the only mitigation security teams have is to apply these patches immediately,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The average time from public disclosure to exploitation at scale is less than five days, with threat actors, ransomware groups, and affiliates quick to leverage these vulnerabilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two other zero-days patched by Microsoft today also were elevation of privilege flaws: <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-32709" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2025-32709</a>, which concerns afd.sys, the <strong>Windows Ancillary Function Driver</strong> that enables Windows applications to connect to the Internet; and <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-30400" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2025-30400</a>, a weakness in the <strong>Desktop Window Manager</strong> (DWM) library for Windows. As <strong>Adam Barnett</strong> at <strong>Rapid7</strong> notes, tomorrow marks the <a href="https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2024/05/14/patch-tuesday-may-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2024/05/14/patch-tuesday-may-2024/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1747257386891000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3VPzmtS8Na55bRRDOUkbDw">one-year anniversary</a> of <a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2024-30051" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2024-30051&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1747257386891000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2HzZh4Tm-0eKXolluDR0FX">CVE-2024-30051</a>, a previous zero-day elevation of privilege vulnerability in this same DWM component.</p>
<p>The fifth zero-day patched today is <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-30397" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2025-30397</a>, a flaw in the <strong>Microsoft Scripting Engine</strong>, a key component used by <strong>Internet Explorer</strong> and <strong>Internet Explorer mode</strong> in <strong>Microsoft Edge</strong>.<span id="more-71250"></span></p>
<p><strong>Chris Goettl</strong> at <strong>Ivanti</strong> points out that the Windows 11 and Server 2025 updates include some new AI features that carry a lot of baggage and weigh in at around 4 gigabytes. Said baggage includes new artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, including the controversial <strong>Recall</strong> feature, which constantly takes screenshots of what users are doing on Windows CoPilot-enabled computers.</p>
<p>Microsoft went back to the drawing board on Recall after a fountain of negative feedback from security experts, who warned it would present an attractive target and a potential gold mine for attackers. Microsoft appears to have made some efforts to prevent Recall from scooping up sensitive financial information, but privacy and security concerns still linger. Former Microsoftie <strong>Kevin Beaumont</strong> has <a href="https://cyberplace.social/@GossiTheDog/114360483150635243" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a good teardown</a> on Microsoft&#8217;s updates to Recall.</p>
<p>In any case, <strong>windowslatest.com</strong> reports that <strong>Windows 11 version 24H2</strong> shows up ready for downloads, even if you don&#8217;t want it.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will now show up for &#8216;download and install&#8217; automatically if you go to Settings &gt; Windows Update and click Check for updates, but only when your device does not have a compatibility hold,&#8221; the publication <a href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2025/05/05/windows-11-24h2-now-fully-ready-downloads-even-if-you-dont-want-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>. &#8220;Even if you don&#8217;t check for updates, Windows 11 24H2 will automatically download at some point.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apple users likely have their own patching to do. On May 12 Apple released security updates to fix at least 30 vulnerabilities in <strong>iOS</strong> and <strong>iPadOS</strong> (the updated version <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/122404" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is 18.5</a>). <strong>TechCrunch</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/12/apple-brings-emergency-satellite-features-to-iphone-13-with-ios-18-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writes</a> that iOS 18.5 also expands emergency satellite capabilities to iPhone 13 owners for the first time (previously it was only available on iPhone 14 or later).</p>
<p>Apple also <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/100100" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released updates</a> for <strong>macOS Sequoia</strong>, <strong>macOS Sonoma</strong>, <strong>macOS Ventura</strong>, <strong>WatchOS</strong>, <strong>tvOS</strong> and <strong>visionOS</strong>. Apple said there is no indication of active exploitation for any of the vulnerabilities fixed this month.</p>
<p>As always, please back up your device and/or important data before attempting any updates. And please feel free to sound off in the comments if you run into any problems applying any of these fixes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Texas firm recently charged with conspiring to distribute synthetic opioids in the United States is at the center of a vast network of companies in the U.S. and Pakistan whose employees are accused of using online ads to scam westerners seeking help with trademarks, book writing, mobile app development and logo designs, a new investigation reveals.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/motion_to_seal_eWorldTrade_Azneem_Bilwani_Abtach_drugs_merged_usa_vs_eworldtradellc-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an indictment</a> (PDF) unsealed last month, the <strong>U.S. Department of Justice</strong> said Dallas-based <strong>eWorldTrade</strong> &#8220;operated an online business-to-business marketplace that facilitated the distribution of synthetic opioids such as isotonitazene and carfentanyl, both significantly more potent than fentanyl.&#8221;</p>
<p>Launched in 2017, eWorldTrade[.]com now features <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-online-marketplace-operator-charged-trafficking-deadly-synthetic-opioids-stronger" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a seizure notice</a> from the DOJ. eWorldTrade operated as a wholesale seller of consumer goods, including clothes, machinery, chemicals, automobiles and appliances. The DOJ&#8217;s indictment includes no additional details about eWorldTrade&#8217;s business, origins or other activity, and at first glance the website might appear to be a legitimate e-commerce platform that also just happened to sell some restricted chemicals.</p>

<p>However, an investigation into the company&#8217;s founders reveals they are connected to a sprawling network of websites that have a history of extortionate scams involving trademark registration, book publishing, exam preparation, and the design of logos, mobile applications and websites.</p>
<p><a href="https://uspto.report/TM/98283759/ELR20240903134921/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Records</a> from the <strong>U.S. Patent and Trademark Office </strong>(USPTO) show the eWorldTrade mark is owned by an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/azneem-bilwani-1630291a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>Azneem Bilwani </b></a>in Karachi (this name also is in the registration records for the now-seized eWorldTrade domain). Mr. Bilwani is perhaps better known as the director of the Pakistan-based IT provider <strong>Abtach Ltd.</strong>, which has been <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/TM-Show-Cause-Order-Abtach-et-al.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">singled out</a> by the USPTO <a href="https://www.worldtrademarkreview.com/data/wtr-investigation-exclusives/wtr-investigation-exclusives/article/google-blocks-ads-trademark-terminal-operator-abtach-following-uspto-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and Google</a> for operating trademark registration scams (the main offices for <span style="font-weight: 400;">eWorldtrade and Abtach share the same address in Pakistan).</span></p>
<p>In November 2021, the USPTO <a href="https://www.worldtrademarkreview.com/data/wtr-investigation-exclusives/wtr-investigation-exclusives/article/the-dangerous-legacy-of-axact-how-diploma-mill-in-pakistan-led-trademark-scam-epidemic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accused Abtach</a> of perpetrating &#8220;an egregious scheme to deceive and defraud applicants for federal trademark registrations by improperly altering official USPTO correspondence, overcharging application filing fees, misappropriating the USPTO’s trademarks, and impersonating the USPTO.&#8221;</p>
<p>Abtach offered trademark registration at suspiciously low prices compared to legitimate costs of over USD $1,500, and claimed they could register a trademark in 24 hours. Abtach reportedly <a href="https://www.worldtrademarkreview.com/data/wtr-investigation-exclusives/wtr-investigation-exclusives/article/abtach-rebrands-intersys-after-being-banned-uspto" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rebranded </a>to <strong>Intersys Limited</strong> after the USPTO banned Abtach from filing any more trademark applications.</p>

<h2>FROM AXACT TO ABTACH</h2>
<p>Many of Abtach&#8217;s employees are former associates of a similar company in Pakistan called <strong>Axact</strong> that was targeted by Pakistani authorities in a 2015 fraud investigation. Axact came under law enforcement scrutiny after <strong>The New York Times</strong> ran <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/18/world/asia/fake-diplomas-real-cash-pakistani-company-axact-reaps-millions-columbiana-barkley.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a front-page story</a> about the company&#8217;s most lucrative scam business: Hundreds of sites peddling fake college degrees and diplomas.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People who purchased fake certifications were subsequently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/11/world/asia/pakistan-axact-degree-scam.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blackmailed by Axact employees posing as government officials</a>, who would demand additional payments under threats of prosecution or imprisonment for having bought fraudulent “unauthorized” academic degrees. This practice created a continuous cycle of extortion, internally referred to as &#8220;upselling.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Axact took money from at least 215,000 people in 197 countries — one-third of them from the United States,&#8221; The Times reported. &#8220;Sales agents wielded threats and false promises and impersonated government officials, earning the company at least $89 million in its final year of operation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dozens of top Axact employees were arrested, jailed, held for months, tried and sentenced to seven years for various fraud violations. But a 2019 research brief on Axact&#8217;s diploma mills found none of those convicted had started their prison sentence, and that several had fled Pakistan and never returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;In October 2016, a Pakistan district judge acquitted 24 Axact officials at trial due to &#8216;not enough evidence&#8217; and then later admitted he had accepted a bribe (of $35,209) from Axact,&#8221; reads <a href="https://www.aacrao.org/docs/default-source/webinar-documents/94-4-academic-fraud-and-the-worlds-largest-diploma-mill.pdf?sfvrsn=4b276f1f_2#:~:text=Dozens%20of%20top%20Axact%20ex,was%20caught%20at%20the%20airport." target="_blank" rel="noopener">a history</a> (PDF) published by the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers.</p>
<p>In 2021, Pakistan&#8217;s <strong>Federal Investigation Agency</strong> (FIA) charged Bilwani and nearly four dozen others &#8212; many of them Abtach employees &#8212; with running an elaborate trademark scam. The authorities <a href="https://files.lbr.cloud/public/2021-02/report.pdf?nh3DUDQa7dd3jS63lsAN2dWDbHIQjplS=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">called it</a> &#8220;the biggest money laundering case in the history of Pakistan,&#8221; and named a number of businesses based in Texas that allegedly helped move the proceeds of cybercrime.</p>

<p>The FIA <a href="https://www.worldtrademarkreview.com/data/wtr-investigation-exclusives/wtr-investigation-exclusives/article/uspto-users-targeted-in-massive-fraud-and-money-laundering-case-in-pakistan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> the defendants operated a large number of websites offering low-cost trademark services to customers, before then “ignoring them after getting the funds and later demanding more funds from clients/victims in the name of up-sale (extortion).&#8221; The Pakistani law enforcement agency said that about 75 percent of customers received fake or fabricated trademarks as a result of the scams.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FIA <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dFChoGQHXw7yi-JdVuow3k1XBAuPwAlv/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> Abtach operates in conjunction with a Karachi firm called <strong>Digitonics Labs</strong>, which earned <a href="https://www.worldtrademarkreview.com/data/wtr-investigation-exclusives/wtr-investigation-exclusives/article/bribery-impersonation-abuse-shocking-details-revealed-in-pakistan-fraud-case-targeted-uspto-users" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a monthly revenue of around $2.5 million</a> through the &#8220;extortion of international clients in the name of up-selling, the sale of fake/fabricated USPTO certificates, and the maintaining of phishing websites.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>According the Pakistani authorities, the accused also ran countless scams involving ebook publication and logo creation, wherein customers are subjected to advance-fee fraud and extortion &#8212; with the scammers demanding more money for supposed &#8220;copyright release&#8221; and threatening to release the trademark.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also charged by the FIA was </span><b>Junaid Mansoor</b>, <span style="font-weight: 400;">the owner of Digitonics Labs in Karachi. Mansoor&#8217;s </span><b><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.K.-registered company </span></b><a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/officers/9Xl14hjK0LtYFKRI7kI_werr3As/appointments" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maple Solutions Direct Limited</span></a> <b><span style="font-weight: 400;">has run at least 700 ads for logo design websites since 2015, the Google Ads Transparency page <a href="https://adstransparency.google.com/advertiser/AR16545428366065401857?region=anywhere" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a>.

<div id="attachment_71135" style="width: 702px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71135" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-71135" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/junaidmansoor.png" alt="" width="692" height="290" /><p id="caption-attachment-71135" class="wp-caption-text">Junaid Mansoor. Source: youtube/@Olevels․com School.</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mr. Mansoor is actively involved with and promoting a Quran study business called <strong>quranmasteronline[.]com</strong>, which was founded by Junaid&#8217;s brother <strong>Qasim Mansoor</strong> (Qasim is also named in the FIA criminal investigation). The Google ads promoting quranmasteronline[.]com were paid for by <a href="https://adstransparency.google.com/advertiser/AR14975696108041273345?region=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the same account</a> advertising a number of scam websites selling logo and web design services. </span></p>
<p>Junaid Mansoor did not respond to requests for comment. An address in Teaneck, New Jersey where Mr. Mansoor previously lived <a href="https://www.mapquest.com/us/new-jersey/exporthub-378873083" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is listed as an official address of exporthub[.]com</a>, a Pakistan-based e-commerce website that appears remarkably similar to eWorldTrade (Exporthub says its offices are in Texas). Interestingly, a search in Google for this domain shows ExportHub currently features <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aexporthub.com+fentanyl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple listings for fentanyl citrate</a> from suppliers in China and elsewhere.</p>
<p>The CEO of Digitonics Labs is <strong>Muhammad Burhan Mirza</strong>, a former Axact official who was arrested by the FIA as part of its money laundering and trademark fraud investigation in 2021. In 2023, prosecutors in Pakistan charged Mirza, Mansoor and 14 other Digitonics employees with fraud, impersonating government officials, phishing, cheating and extortion. Mirza&#8217;s LinkedIn profile says he currently runs an educational technology/life coach enterprise called <strong>TheCoach360</strong>, which purports to help young kids &#8220;achieve financial independence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reached via LinkedIn, Mr. Mirza denied having anything to do with eWorldTrade or any of its sister companies in Texas.</p>
<p>&#8220;Moreover, I have no knowledge as to the companies you have mentioned,&#8221; said Mr. Mirza, who did not respond to follow-up questions.</p>
<p>The current disposition of the FIA&#8217;s fraud case against the defendants is unclear. The investigation was marred early on by allegations of corruption and bribery. In 2021, Pakistani authorities alleged Bilwani paid a six-figure bribe to FIA investigators. Meanwhile, attorneys for Mr. Bilwani <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/194s1jG24OE2KjHtOhfGu51i6NhCFGV2X/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have argued</a> that although their client did pay a bribe, the payment was solicited by government officials. Mr. Bilwani did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<h2>THE TEXAS NEXUS</h2>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity has learned that the people and entities at the center of the FIA investigations have built a significant presence in the United States, with a strong concentration in Texas. The Texas businesses promote websites that sell logo and web design, ghostwriting, and academic cheating services. Many of these entities have recently been sued for fraud and breach of contract by angry former customers, who claimed the companies relentlessly upsold them while failing to produce the work as promised.</p>
<p>For example, the FIA complaints named <strong>Retrocube LLC </strong>and <strong>360 Digital Marketing LLC</strong>, two entities that share a street address with eWorldTrade: 1910 Pacific Avenue, Suite 8025, Dallas, Texas. Also incorporated at that Pacific Avenue address is <strong>abtach[.]ae</strong>, a web design and marketing firm based in Dubai; and <strong>intersyslimited[.]com</strong>, the new name of Abtach after they were banned by the USPTO. Other businesses registered at this address market services for logo design, mobile app development, and ghostwriting.</p>

<p>360 Digital Marketing&#8217;s website 360digimarketing[.]com is owned by an Abtach front company called <strong>Abtech LTD</strong>. Meanwhile, <a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/10311269/officers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business records show</a> <strong>360 Digi Marketing LTD</strong> is a U.K. company whose officers include former Abtach director Bilwani; <b>Muhammad Saad Iqbal</b>, formerly Abtach, now CEO of Intersys Ltd; <b>Niaz Ahmed</b>, a former Abtach associate; and<b> Muhammad Salman Yousuf</b>, formerly a vice president at Axact, Abtach, and Digitonics Labs.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s Ads Transparency Center finds 360 Digital Marketing LLC ran at least 500 ads promoting various websites selling ghostwriting services . Another entity tied to Junaid Mansoor &#8212; a company called <strong>Octa Group Technologies AU</strong> &#8212; has run <a href="https://adstransparency.google.com/advertiser/AR08603440443079786497?region=anywhere" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approximately 300 Google ads</a> for book publishing services, promoting confusingly named websites like <span style="font-weight: 400;">amazonlistinghub[.]com and barnesnoblepublishing[.]co.</span></p>

<p><strong>Rameez Moiz </strong>is a Texas resident and former Abtach product manager who has represented 360 Digital Marketing LLC and RetroCube. Moiz told KrebsOnSecurity he stopped working for 360 Digital Marketing in the summer of 2023.

<p>In April 2025, California resident <strong>Melinda Will</strong> <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qRhvQ6mdyRrFpzWBOdschOo71xIP7ikT/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued</a> the Texas firm <strong>Majestic Ghostwriting </strong>&#8212; which is doing business as <strong>ghostwritingsquad[.]com</strong> &#8212;  alleging they scammed her out of $100,000 after she hired them to help write her book.

<h2>VICTIMS SPEAK OUT</h2>
<p>Ms. Will&#8217;s lawsuit is just one of more than two dozen complaints over the past four years wherein plaintiffs sued one of this group&#8217;s web design, wiki editing or ghostwriting services. In 2021, a New Jersey man <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HOXxv4GP3-zz2tujPYHChmWBY6KUc70P/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued Octagroup Technologies</a>, alleging they ripped him off when he paid a total of more than $26,000 for the design and marketing of a web-based mapping service.</p>
<p>The plaintiff in that case did not respond to requests for comment, but his complaint alleges Octagroup and a myriad other companies it contracted with produced minimal work product despite subjecting him to relentless upselling. That case was decided in favor of the plaintiff because the defendants never contested the matter in court.</p>
<p>In 2023, 360 Digital Marketing LLC and Retrocube LLC were sued by a woman who said they scammed her out of $40,000 over a book she wanted help writing. That lawsuit helpfully showed <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w_6-RqZl7GBea-WtdgFkv6xHRVWaG5DV/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an image of the office front door</a> at 1910 Pacific Ave Suite 8025, which featured the logos of 360 Digital Marketing, Retrocube, and eWorldTrade.</p>
<div id="attachment_71140" style="width: 621px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71140" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-71140" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/360digitalmarketingfrontdoorintexas.png" alt="" width="611" height="763" /><p id="caption-attachment-71140" class="wp-caption-text">The front door at 1910 Pacific Avenue, Suite 8025, Dallas, Texas.</p></div>
<p>The lawsuit was filed pro se by <strong>Leigh Riley</strong>, a 64-year-old career IT professional who paid 360 Digital Marketing to have a company called <strong>Talented Ghostwriter</strong> co-author and promote a series of books she&#8217;d outlined on spirituality and healing.</p>
<p>&#8220;The main reason I hired them was because I didn&#8217;t understand what I call the formula for writing a book, and I know there&#8217;s a lot of marketing that goes into publishing,&#8221; Riley explained in an interview. &#8220;I know nothing about that stuff, and these guys were convincing that they could handle all aspects of it. Until I discovered they couldn&#8217;t write a damn sentence in English properly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Riley&#8217;s well-documented lawsuit (not linked here because it features a great deal of personal information) includes screenshots of conversations with the ghostwriting team, which was constantly assigning her to new writers and editors, and ghosting her on scheduled conference calls about progress on the project. Riley said she ended up writing most of the book herself because the work they produced was unusable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Finally after months of promising the books were printed and on their way, they show up at my doorstep with the wrong title on the book,&#8221; Riley said. When she demanded her money back, she said the people helping her with the website to promote the book locked her out of the site.</p>
<div id="attachment_71203" style="width: 764px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71203" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-71203" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/rileylawsuit.png" alt="" width="754" height="686" /><p id="caption-attachment-71203" class="wp-caption-text">A conversation snippet from Leigh Riley&#8217;s lawsuit against Talented Ghostwriter, aka 360 Digital Marketing LLC. &#8220;Other companies once they have you money they don&#8217;t even respond or do anything,&#8221; the ghostwriting team manager explained.</p></div>
<p>Riley decided to sue, naming 360 Digital Marketing LLC and Retrocube LLC, among others.  The companies offered to settle the matter for $20,000, which she accepted. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t have money to hire a lawyer, and I figured it was time to cut my losses,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Riley said she could have saved herself a great deal of headache by doing some basic research on Talented Ghostwriter, whose website claims the company is based in Los Angeles. According to the California Secretary of State, however, there is no registered entity by that name. Rather, the address claimed by <strong>talentedghostwriter[.]com</strong> is a vacant office building with a &#8220;space available&#8221; sign in the window.</p>
<p>California resident <strong>Walter Horsting </strong>discovered something similar when he sued 360 Digital Marketing in small claims court last year, after hiring a company called <strong>Vox Ghostwriting</strong> to help write, edit and promote a spy novel he&#8217;d been working on. Horsting said he paid Vox $3,300 to ghostwrite a 280-page book, and was upsold an Amazon marketing and publishing package for $7,500.</p>
<p>In an interview, Horsting said the prose that Vox Ghostwriting produced was &#8220;juvenile at best,&#8221; forcing him to rewrite and edit the work himself, and to partner with a graphical artist to produce illustrations. Horsting said that when it came time to begin marketing the novel, Vox Ghostwriting tried to further upsell him on marketing packages, while dodging scheduled meetings with no follow-up.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have a money back guarantee, and when they wouldn&#8217;t refund my money I said I&#8217;m taking you to court,&#8221; Horsting recounted. &#8220;I tried to serve them in Los Angeles but found no such office exists. I talked to a salon next door and they said someone else had recently shown up desperately looking for where the ghostwriting company went, and it appears there are a trail of corpses on this. I finally tracked down where they are in Texas.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the same office that Ms. Riley served her lawsuit against. Horsting said he has a court hearing scheduled later this month, but he&#8217;s under no illusions that winning the case means he&#8217;ll be able to collect.</p>
<p>&#8220;At this point, I&#8217;m doing it out of pride more than actually expecting anything to come to good fortune for me,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The following mind map was helpful in piecing together key events, individuals and connections mentioned above. It&#8217;s important to note that this graphic only scratches the surface of the operations tied to this group. For example, in Case 2 we can see mention of academic cheating services, wherein people can be hired to take online proctored exams on one&#8217;s behalf. Those who hire these services soon find themselves subject to impersonation and blackmail attempts for larger and larger sums of money, with the threat of publicly exposing their unethical academic cheating activity.</p>

<h2>GOOGLE RESPONDS</h2>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity reviewed the Google Ad Transparency links for nearly 500 different websites tied to this network of ghostwriting, logo, app and web development businesses. Those website names were then fed into <strong>spyfu.com</strong>, a competitive intelligence company that tracks the reach and performance of advertising keywords. Spyfu estimates that between April 2023 and April 2025, those websites <em>spent more than $10 million on Google ads</em>.</p>
<p>Reached for comment, Google said in a written statement that it is constantly policing its ad network for bad actors, pointing to <a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/ads_safety_report_2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an ads safety report</a> (PDF) showing Google blocked or removed 5.1 billion bad ads last year &#8212; including more than 500 million ads related to trademarks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our policy against Enabling Dishonest Behavior prohibits products or services that help users mislead others, including ads for paper-writing or exam-taking services,&#8221; the statement reads. &#8220;When we identify ads or advertisers that violate our policies, we take action, including by suspending advertiser accounts, disapproving ads, and restricting ads to specific domains when appropriate.&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-71192" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/googleadpolicyenforcement.png" alt="" width="749" height="490" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/googleadpolicyenforcement.png 980w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/googleadpolicyenforcement-768x502.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/googleadpolicyenforcement-782x511.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" /></p>
<p>Google did not respond to specific questions about the advertising entities mentioned in this story, saying only that &#8220;we are actively investigating this matter and addressing any policy violations, including suspending advertiser accounts when appropriate.&#8221;</p>
<p>From reviewing the ad accounts that have been promoting these scam websites, it appears Google has very recently acted to remove a large number of the offending ads. Prior to my notifying Google about the extent of this ad network on April 28, the Google Ad Transparency network listed over 500 ads for 360 Digital Marketing; as of this publication, that number had <a href="https://adstransparency.google.com/advertiser/AR11727645009044832257?region=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dwindled to 10</a>.</p>
<p>On April 30, Google <a href="https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/16189141?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=16083443" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that starting this month its ads transparency page will display the payment profile name as the payer name for verified advertisers, if that name differs from their verified advertiser name. Searchengineland.com <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-adds-to-its-transparency-rules-for-who-is-paying-for-ads-454899" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writes</a> the changes are aimed at increasing accountability in digital advertising.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An employee at Elon Musk&#8217;s artificial intelligence company <strong>xAI</strong> leaked a private key on <strong>GitHub</strong> that for the past two months could have allowed anyone to query private xAI large language models (LLMs) which appear to have been custom made for working with internal data from Musk&#8217;s companies, including <strong>SpaceX</strong>, <strong>Tesla</strong> and <strong>Twitter/X, </strong>KrebsOnSecurity has learned.</p>
<div id="attachment_71170" style="width: 758px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71170" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-71170" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/x-ai.png" alt="" width="748" height="497" /><p id="caption-attachment-71170" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Shutterstock, @sdx15.</p></div>
<p><strong>Philippe Caturegli</strong>, &#8220;chief hacking officer&#8221; at the security consultancy <strong>Seralys</strong>, was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/caturegli_yo-xai-your-devs-are-leaking-api-keys-on-activity-7321566948020953088-6KXj?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAAliaMB3BQO-WOS-eUh-XU4HAd5h8pTzkI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the first to publicize the leak</a> of credentials for an x.ai application programming interface (API) exposed in the GitHub code repository of a technical staff member at xAI.</p>
<p>Caturegli&#8217;s post on LinkedIn caught the attention of researchers at <strong>GitGuardian</strong>, a company that specializes in detecting and remediating exposed secrets in public and proprietary environments. GitGuardian&#8217;s systems constantly scan GitHub and other code repositories for exposed API keys, and fire off automated alerts to affected users.</p>
<p>GitGuardian&#8217;s <strong>Eric Fourrier</strong> told KrebsOnSecurity the exposed API key had access to several unreleased models of <strong>Grok</strong>, the AI chatbot developed by xAI. In total, GitGuardian found the key had access to at least 60 fine-tuned and private LLMs.</p>
<p>&#8220;The credentials can be used to access the X.ai API with the identity of the user,&#8221; GitGuardian wrote in an email explaining their findings to xAI. &#8220;The associated account not only has access to public Grok models (grok-2-1212, etc) but also to what appears to be unreleased (grok-2.5V), development (research-grok-2p5v-1018), and private models (tweet-rejector, grok-spacex-2024-11-04).&#8221;</p>
<p>Fourrier found GitGuardian had alerted the xAI employee about the exposed API key nearly two months ago &#8212; on March 2. But as of April 30, when GitGuardian directly alerted xAI&#8217;s security team to the exposure, the key was still valid and usable. xAI told GitGuardian to report the matter through its bug bounty program at <strong>HackerOne</strong>, but just a few hours later the repository containing the API key was removed from GitHub.</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks like some of these internal LLMs were fine-tuned on SpaceX data, and some were fine-tuned with Tesla data,&#8221; Fourrier said. &#8220;I definitely don&#8217;t think a Grok model that&#8217;s fine-tuned on SpaceX data is intended to be exposed publicly.&#8221;</p>
<p>xAI did not respond to a request for comment. Nor did the 28-year-old xAI technical staff member whose key was exposed.<span id="more-71165"></span></p>
<p><strong>Carole Winqwist</strong>, chief marketing officer at GitGuardian, said giving potentially hostile users free access to private LLMs is a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re an attacker and you have direct access to the model and the back end interface for things like Grok, it&#8217;s definitely something you can use for further attacking,&#8221; she said. &#8220;An attacker could it use for prompt injection, to tweak the (LLM) model to serve their purposes, or try to implant code into the supply chain.&#8221;</p>
<p>The inadvertent exposure of internal LLMs for xAI comes as Musk&#8217;s so-called <strong>Department of Government Efficiency</strong> (DOGE) has been feeding sensitive government records into artificial intelligence tools. In February, <strong>The Washington Post</strong> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/06/elon-musk-doge-ai-department-education/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> DOGE officials were feeding data from across the Education Department into AI tools to probe the agency&#8217;s programs and spending.</p>
<p>The Post said DOGE plans to replicate this process across many departments and agencies, accessing the back-end software at different parts of the government and then using AI technology to extract and sift through information about spending on employees and programs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Feeding sensitive data into AI software puts it into the possession of a system&#8217;s operator, increasing the chances it will be leaked or swept up in cyberattacks,&#8221; Post reporters wrote.</p>
<p>Wired reported in March that DOGE has <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/gsai-chatbot-1500-federal-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deployed a proprietary chatbot called GSAi</a> to 1,500 federal workers at the <strong>General Services Administration</strong>, part of an effort to automate tasks previously done by humans as DOGE continues its purge of the federal workforce.</p>
<p>A <strong>Reuters</strong> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/musks-doge-using-ai-snoop-us-federal-workers-sources-say-2025-04-08/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> last month said Trump administration officials told some U.S. government employees that DOGE is using AI to surveil at least one federal agency&#8217;s communications for hostility to President Trump and his agenda. Reuters wrote that the DOGE team has heavily deployed Musk’s Grok AI chatbot as part of their work slashing the federal government, although Reuters said it could not establish exactly how Grok was being used.</p>
<p>Caturegli said while there is no indication that federal government or user data could be accessed through the exposed x.ai API key, these private models are likely trained on proprietary data and may unintentionally expose details related to internal development efforts at xAI, Twitter, or SpaceX.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that this key was publicly exposed for two months and granted access to internal models is concerning,&#8221; Caturegli said. &#8220;This kind of long-lived credential exposure highlights weak key management and insufficient internal monitoring, raising questions about safeguards around developer access and broader operational security.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 23-year-old Scottish man thought to be a member of the prolific <strong>Scattered Spider</strong> cybercrime group was extradited last week from Spain to the United States, where he is facing charges of wire fraud, conspiracy and identity theft. U.S. prosecutors allege <strong>Tyler Robert Buchanan</strong> and co-conspirators hacked into dozens of companies in the United States and abroad, and that he personally controlled more than $26 million stolen from victims.</p>
<p>Scattered Spider is a loosely affiliated criminal hacking group whose members have broken into and stolen data from some of the world&#8217;s largest technology companies. Buchanan was arrested in Spain last year on a warrant from the FBI, which wanted him in connection with a series of SMS-based phishing attacks in the summer of 2022 that led to intrusions at Twilio, LastPass, DoorDash, Mailchimp, and many other tech firms.</p>
<div id="attachment_67783" style="width: 758px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-67783" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-67783" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tylerb.png" alt="" width="748" height="308" /><p id="caption-attachment-67783" class="wp-caption-text">Tyler Buchanan, being escorted by Spanish police at the airport in Palma de Mallorca in June 2024.</p></div>
<p>As <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/06/alleged-boss-of-scattered-spider-hacking-group-arrested/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first reported</a> by KrebsOnSecurity, Buchanan (a.k.a. &#8220;tylerb&#8221;) fled the United Kingdom in February 2023, after a rival cybercrime gang hired thugs to invade his home, assault his mother, and threaten to burn him with a blowtorch unless he gave up the keys to his cryptocurrency wallet. Buchanan was arrested in June 2024 at the airport in Palma de Mallorca while trying to board a flight to Italy. His extradition to the United States was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-24/scattered-spider-hacking-suspect-extradited-to-us-from-spain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first reported</a> last week by <strong>Bloomberg</strong>.</p>
<p>Members of Scattered Spider have been <a href="https://cyberscoop.com/youth-hacking-ring-at-the-center-of-cybercrime-spree/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tied</a> to the 2023 ransomware attacks against <strong>MGM</strong> and <strong>Caesars</strong> casinos in Las Vegas, but it remains unclear whether Buchanan was implicated in that incident. The Justice Department&#8217;s complaint against Buchanan makes no mention of the 2023 ransomware attack.</p>
<p>Rather, the investigation into Buchanan appears to center on the SMS phishing campaigns from 2022, and on <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/sim-swapping/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SIM-swapping attacks</a> that siphoned funds from individual cryptocurrency investors. In a SIM-swapping attack, crooks transfer the target’s phone number to a device they control and intercept any text messages or phone calls to the victim&#8217;s device — including one-time passcodes for authentication and password reset links sent via SMS.</p>
<p>In August 2022, KrebsOnSecurity <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/08/how-1-time-passcodes-became-a-corporate-liability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reviewed data harvested in a months-long cybercrime campaign by Scattered Spider</a> involving countless SMS-based phishing attacks against employees at major corporations. The security firm <strong>Group-IB</strong> called them by a different name — <strong>0ktapus</strong>, because the group typically spoofed the identity provider <strong>Okta</strong> in their phishing messages to employees at targeted firms.</p>
<div id="attachment_61078" style="width: 654px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-61078" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-61078 size-full" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/twiliophish.png" alt="" width="644" height="471" /><p id="caption-attachment-61078" class="wp-caption-text">A Scattered Spider/0Ktapus SMS phishing lure sent to Twilio employees in 2022.</p></div>
<p>The <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/tylerb-complaint.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complaint against Buchanan</a> (PDF) says the FBI tied him to the 2022 SMS phishing attacks after discovering the same username and email address was used to register numerous Okta-themed phishing domains seen in the campaign. The domain registrar <strong>NameCheap</strong> found that less than a month before the phishing spree, the account that registered those domains logged in from an Internet address in the U.K. FBI investigators said the Scottish police told them the address was leased to Buchanan from January 26, 2022 to November 7, 2022.</p>
<p>Authorities seized at least 20 digital devices when they raided Buchanan&#8217;s residence, and on one of those devices they found usernames and passwords for employees of three different companies targeted in the phishing campaign.</p>
<p>&#8220;The FBI’s investigation to date has gathered evidence showing that Buchanan and his co-conspirators targeted at least 45 companies in the United States and abroad, including Canada, India, and the United Kingdom,&#8221; the FBI complaint reads. &#8220;One of Buchanan&#8217;s devices contained a screenshot of Telegram messages between an account known to be used by Buchanan and other unidentified co-conspirators discussing dividing up the proceeds of SIM swapping.&#8221;<span id="more-71147"></span></p>
<p>U.S. prosecutors allege that records obtained from Discord showed the same U.K. Internet address was used to operate a Discord account that specified a cryptocurrency wallet when asking another user to send funds. The complaint says the publicly available transaction history for that payment address shows approximately 391 bitcoin was transferred in and out of this address between October 2022 and<br />
February 2023; 391 bitcoin is presently worth more than $26 million.</p>
<p>In November 2024, federal prosecutors in Los Angeles <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/11/feds-charge-five-men-in-scattered-spider-roundup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unsealed criminal charges against Buchanan</a> and four other alleged Scattered Spider members, including <strong>Ahmed Elbadawy</strong>, 23, of College Station, Texas; <strong>Joel Evans</strong>, 25, of Jacksonville, North Carolina; <strong>Evans Osiebo</strong>, 20, of Dallas; and <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/01/fla-man-charged-in-sim-swapping-spree-is-key-suspect-in-hacker-groups-oktapus-scattered-spider/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Noah Urban</strong></a>, 20, of Palm Coast, Florida. KrebsOnSecurity <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/09/the-dark-nexus-between-harm-groups-and-the-com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported last year</a> that another suspected Scattered Spider member &#8212; a 17-year-old from the United Kingdom &#8212; was arrested as part of a joint investigation with the FBI into the MGM hack.</p>
<p>Mr. Buchanan&#8217;s court-appointed attorney did not respond to a request for comment. The accused faces charges of wire fraud conspiracy, conspiracy to obtain information by computer for private financial gain, and aggravated identity theft. Convictions on the latter charge carry a minimum sentence of two years in prison.</p>
<p>Documents from the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California indicate Buchanan is being held without bail pending trial. A preliminary hearing in the case is slated for May 6.</p>

The whistleblower said accounts created for DOGE at the NLRB downloaded three code repositories from <strong>GitHub</strong>.

<p>According to <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/04/whistleblower-doge-siphoned-nlrb-case-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a whistleblower complaint</a> filed last week by <strong>Daniel J. Berulis</strong>, a 38-year-old security architect at the NLRB, officials from DOGE met with NLRB leaders on March 3 and demanded the creation of several all-powerful “tenant admin” accounts that were to be exempted from network logging activity that would otherwise keep a detailed record of all actions taken by those accounts.</p>
<p>Berulis said the new DOGE accounts had unrestricted permission to read, copy, and alter information contained in NLRB databases. The new accounts also could restrict log visibility, delay retention, route logs elsewhere, or even remove them entirely — top-tier user privileges that neither Berulis nor his boss possessed.</p>
<p>Berulis said he discovered one of the DOGE accounts had downloaded three external code libraries from <strong>GitHub</strong> that neither NLRB nor its contractors ever used. A “readme” file in one of the code bundles explained it was created to rotate connections through a large pool of cloud Internet addresses that serve “<em>as a proxy to generate pseudo-infinite IPs for web scraping and brute forcing</em>.” Brute force attacks involve automated login attempts that try many credential combinations in rapid sequence.</p>
<p>A search on that description in Google brings up a code repository at GitHub for a user with the account name &#8220;<strong>Ge0rg3</strong>&#8221; who published a program roughly four years ago called &#8220;<a href="https://github.com/Ge0rg3/requests-ip-rotator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requests-ip-rotator</a>,&#8221; described as a library that will allow the user &#8220;to bypass IP-based rate-limits for sites and services.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A Python library to utilize AWS API Gateway&#8217;s large IP pool as a proxy to generate pseudo-infinite IPs for web scraping and brute forcing,&#8221; the description reads.</p>

<p>A key DOGE staff member who gained access to the Treasury Department&#8217;s central payments system, Elez has worked for a number of Musk companies, including <strong>X</strong>, <strong>SpaceX</strong>, and <strong>xAI</strong>. Elez was among the first DOGE employees to face public scrutiny, after <strong>The Wall Street Journal</strong> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/doge-staffer-resigns-over-racist-posts-d9f11a93" target="_blank" rel="noopener">linked him to social media posts</a> that advocated racism and eugenics.</p>
<p>Elez resigned after that brief scandal, but was rehired after President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance expressed support for him. <strong>Politico</strong> <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/29/doge-marco-elez-software-engineer-us-payroll-00259303" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> Elez is now a <strong>Labor Department</strong> aide detailed to multiple agencies, including the <strong>Department of Health and Human Services</strong>.</p>
<p>&#8220;During Elez’s initial stint at Treasury, he violated the agency’s information security policies by sending a spreadsheet containing names and payments information to officials at the General Services Administration,&#8221; Politico wrote, citing court filings.</p>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity sought comment from both the NLRB and DOGE, and will update this story if either responds.<span id="more-71075"></span></p>
<p>The NLRB has been effectively hobbled since <strong>President Trump</strong> fired three board members, leaving the agency without the quorum it needs to function. Both <strong>Amazon</strong> and Musk’s <strong>SpaceX</strong> have <a href="https://apnews.com/article/amazon-nlrb-unconstitutional-spacex-elon-musk-ab42977117d883e97110a7bf8e8b257f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">been suing</a> the NLRB over complaints the agency filed in disputes about workers’ rights and union organizing, arguing that the NLRB’s very existence is unconstitutional. On March 5, a U.S. appeals court <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/musks-spacex-loses-early-legal-challenge-us-labor-boards-powers-2025-03-05/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unanimously rejected</a> Musk’s claim that the NLRB’s structure somehow violates the Constitution.</p>
<p>Berulis&#8217;s complaint alleges the DOGE accounts at NLRB downloaded more than 10 gigabytes of data from the agency&#8217;s case files, a database that includes reams of sensitive records including information about employees who want to form unions and proprietary business documents. Berulis said he went public after higher-ups at the agency told him not to report the matter to the US-CERT, as they&#8217;d previously agreed.</p>
<p>Berulis told KrebsOnSecurity he worried the unauthorized data transfer by DOGE could unfairly advantage defendants in a number of ongoing labor disputes before the agency.</p>
<p>&#8220;If any company got the case data that would be an unfair advantage,&#8221; Berulis said. &#8220;They could identify and fire employees and union organizers without saying why.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_71106" style="width: 454px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71106" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-71106" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/markoelez.png" alt="" width="444" height="515" /><p id="caption-attachment-71106" class="wp-caption-text">Marko Elez, in a photo from a social media profile.</p></div>
<p>Berulis said the other two GitHub archives that DOGE employees downloaded to NLRB systems included <strong>Integuru</strong>, a software framework designed to reverse engineer application programming interfaces (APIs) that websites use to fetch data; and a &#8220;headless&#8221; browser called <strong>Browserless</strong>, which is made for automating web-based tasks that require a pool of browsers, such as web scraping and automated testing.</p>
<p>On February 6, someone <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250423135719/https://github.com/markoelez/async-ip-rotator/issues/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted a lengthy and detailed critique</a> of Elez&#8217;s code on the GitHub &#8220;issues&#8221; page for async-ip-rotator, calling it &#8220;insecure, unscalable and a fundamental engineering failure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If this were a side project, it would just be bad code,&#8221; the reviewer wrote. &#8220;But if this is representative of how you build production systems, then there are much larger concerns. This implementation is fundamentally broken, and if anything similar to this is deployed in an environment handling sensitive data, it should be audited immediately.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Update 7:06 p.m. ET</strong>: Elez&#8217;s code repo was deleted after this story was published. An archived version of it <a href="https://github.com/ricci/async-ip-rotator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A security architect with the <strong>National Labor Relations Board</strong> (NLRB) alleges that employees from <strong>Elon Musk</strong>&#8216;s <strong>Department of Government Efficiency</strong> (DOGE) transferred gigabytes of sensitive data from agency case files in early March, using short-lived accounts configured to leave few traces of network activity. The NLRB whistleblower said the unusual large data outflows coincided with multiple blocked login attempts from an Internet address in Russia that tried to use valid credentials for a newly-created DOGE user account.</p>
<div id="attachment_71048" style="width: 759px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71048" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-71048" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/beruliscomplaint.png" alt="" width="749" height="823" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/beruliscomplaint.png 786w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/beruliscomplaint-768x844.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/beruliscomplaint-782x860.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" /><p id="caption-attachment-71048" class="wp-caption-text">The cover letter from Berulis&#8217;s whistleblower statement, sent to the leaders of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.</p></div>
<p>The allegations came in an April 14 letter to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, signed by <strong>Daniel J. Berulis</strong>, a 38-year-old security architect at the NLRB.</p>
<p><strong>NPR</strong>, which was the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/15/nx-s1-5355896/doge-nlrb-elon-musk-spacex-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first to report</a> on Berulis&#8217;s whistleblower complaint, says NLRB is a small, independent federal agency that investigates and adjudicates complaints about unfair labor practices, and stores &#8220;reams of potentially sensitive data, from confidential information about employees who want to form unions to proprietary business information.&#8221;</p>
<p>The complaint documents a one-month period beginning March 3, during which DOGE officials reportedly demanded the creation of all-powerful &#8220;tenant admin&#8221; accounts in NLRB systems that were to be exempted from network logging activity that would otherwise keep a detailed record of all actions taken by those accounts.</p>
<p>Berulis said the new DOGE accounts had unrestricted permission to read, copy, and alter information contained in NLRB databases. The new accounts also could restrict log visibility, delay retention, route logs elsewhere, or even remove them entirely &#8212; top-tier user privileges that neither Berulis nor his boss possessed.</p>
<p>Berulis writes that on March 3, a black SUV accompanied by a police escort arrived at his building &#8212; the NLRB headquarters in Southeast Washington, D.C. The DOGE staffers did not speak with Berulis or anyone else in NLRB&#8217;s IT staff, but instead met with the agency leadership.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our acting chief information officer told us not to adhere to standard operating procedure with the DOGE account creation, and there was to be no logs or records made of the accounts created for DOGE employees, who required the highest level of access,&#8221; Berulis wrote of their instructions after that meeting.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have built in roles that auditors can use and have used extensively in the past but would not give the ability to make changes or access subsystems without approval,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;The suggestion that they use these accounts was not open to discussion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Berulis found that on March 3 one of the DOGE accounts created an opaque, virtual environment known as a &#8220;container,&#8221; which can be used to build and run programs or scripts without revealing its activities to the rest of the world. Berulis said the container caught his attention because he polled his colleagues and found none of them had ever used containers within the NLRB network.</p>
<p>Berulis said he also noticed that early the next morning &#8212; between approximately 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. EST on Tuesday, March 4  &#8212; there was a large increase in outgoing traffic from the agency. He said it took several days of investigating with his colleagues to determine that one of the new accounts had transferred approximately 10 gigabytes worth of data from the NLRB&#8217;s <strong>NxGen</strong> case management system.</p>
<p>Berulis said neither he nor his co-workers had the necessary network access rights to review which files were touched or transferred &#8212; or even where they went. But his complaint notes the NxGen database contains sensitive information on unions, ongoing legal cases, and corporate secrets.</p>
<p>&#8220;I also don’t know if the data was only 10gb in total or whether or not they were consolidated and compressed prior,&#8221; Berulis told the senators. &#8220;This opens up the possibility that even more data was exfiltrated. Regardless, that kind of spike is extremely unusual because data almost never directly leaves NLRB’s databases.&#8221;</p>
<p>Berulis said he and his colleagues grew even more alarmed when they noticed nearly two dozen login attempts from a Russian Internet address (83.149.30,186) that presented valid login credentials for a DOGE employee account &#8212; one that had been created just minutes earlier. Berulis said those attempts were all blocked thanks to rules in place that prohibit logins from non-U.S. locations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoever was attempting to log in was using one of the newly created accounts that were used in the other DOGE related activities and it appeared they had the correct username and password due to the authentication flow only stopping them due to our no-out-of-country logins policy activating,&#8221; Berulis wrote. &#8220;There were more than 20 such attempts, and what is particularly concerning is that many of these login attempts occurred within 15 minutes of the accounts being created by DOGE engineers.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Berulis, the naming structure of one Microsoft user account connected to the suspicious activity suggested it had been created and later deleted for DOGE use in the NLRB&#8217;s cloud systems: &#8220;<strong>DogeSA_2d5c3e0446f9@nlrb.microsoft.com</strong>.&#8221; He also found other new Microsoft cloud administrator accounts with nonstandard usernames, including &#8220;<strong>Whitesox, Chicago M.</strong>&#8221; and &#8220;<strong>Dancehall, Jamaica R</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_71042" style="width: 759px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/whitesoxchicago.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71042" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-71042" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/whitesoxchicago.png" alt="" width="749" height="556" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/whitesoxchicago.png 1072w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/whitesoxchicago-768x570.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/whitesoxchicago-782x581.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-71042" class="wp-caption-text">A screenshot shared by Berulis showing the suspicious user accounts.</p></div>
<p>On March 5, Berulis documented that a large section of logs for recently created network resources were missing, and a network watcher in <strong>Microsoft Azure</strong> was set to the &#8220;off&#8221; state, meaning it was no longer collecting and recording data like it should have.</p>
<p>Berulis said he discovered someone had downloaded three external code libraries from <strong>GitHub</strong> that neither NLRB nor its contractors ever use. A &#8220;readme&#8221; file in one of the code bundles explained it was created to rotate connections through a large pool of cloud Internet addresses that serve &#8220;as a proxy to generate pseudo-infinite IPs for web scraping and brute forcing.&#8221; Brute force attacks involve automated login attempts that try many credential combinations in rapid sequence.</p>
<p>The complaint alleges that by March 17 it became clear the NLRB no longer had the resources or network access needed to fully investigate the odd activity from the DOGE accounts, and that on March 24, the agency&#8217;s associate chief information officer had agreed the matter should be reported to <strong>US-CERT</strong>. Operated by the Department of Homeland Security&#8217;s <strong>Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency</strong> (CISA), US-CERT provides on-site cyber incident response capabilities to federal and state agencies.</p>
<p>But Berulis said that between April 3 and 4, he and the associate CIO were informed that &#8220;instructions had come down to drop the US-CERT reporting and investigation and we were directed not to move forward or create an official report.&#8221; Berulis said it was at this point he decided to go public with his findings.<span id="more-71035"></span></p>
<div id="attachment_71050" style="width: 695px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/berulis-mar4-spike.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71050" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-71050 size-full" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/berulis-mar4-spike.png" alt="" width="685" height="908" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-71050" class="wp-caption-text">An email from Daniel Berulis to his colleagues dated March 28, referencing the unexplained traffic spike earlier in the month and the unauthorized changing of security controls for user accounts.</p></div>
<p><strong>Tim Bearese</strong>, the NLRB&#8217;s acting press secretary, told NPR that DOGE neither requested nor received access to its systems, and that &#8220;the agency conducted an investigation after Berulis raised his concerns but &#8216;determined that no breach of agency systems occurred.'&#8221; The NLRB did not respond to questions from KrebsOnSecurity.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Berulis has shared a number of supporting screenshots showing agency email discussions about the unexplained account activity attributed to the DOGE accounts, as well as NLRB security alerts from Microsoft about network anomalies observed during the timeframes described.</p>
<p>As <strong>CNN</strong> <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/15/business/nlrb-trump-musk-workers/index.html#:~:text=Musk's%20SpaceX%20brought%20a%20case,it%20for%20firing%20some%20employees." target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> last month, the NLRB has been effectively hobbled since <strong>President Trump</strong> fired three board members, leaving the agency without the quorum it needs to function.</p>
<p>&#8220;Despite its limitations, the agency had become a thorn in the side of some of the richest and most powerful people in the nation — notably Elon Musk, Trump’s key supporter both financially and arguably politically,&#8221; CNN wrote.</p>
<p>Both <strong>Amazon</strong> and Musk&#8217;s <strong>SpaceX</strong> have <a href="https://apnews.com/article/amazon-nlrb-unconstitutional-spacex-elon-musk-ab42977117d883e97110a7bf8e8b257f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">been suing</a> the NLRB over complaints the agency filed in disputes about workers&#8217; rights and union organizing, arguing that the NLRB&#8217;s very existence is unconstitutional. On March 5, a U.S. appeals court <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/musks-spacex-loses-early-legal-challenge-us-labor-boards-powers-2025-03-05/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unanimously rejected</a> Musk&#8217;s claim that the NLRB&#8217;s structure somehow violates the Constitution.</p>
<p>Berulis shared screenshots with KrebsOnSecurity showing that on the day the NPR published its story about his claims (April 14), the deputy CIO at NLRB sent an email stating that administrative control had been removed from all employee accounts. Meaning, suddenly none of the IT employees at the agency could do their jobs properly anymore, Berulis said.</p>

<p>Berulis shared a screenshot of an agency-wide email dated April 16 from NLRB director <strong>Lasharn Hamilton</strong> saying DOGE officials had requested a meeting, and reiterating claims that the agency had no prior &#8220;official&#8221; contact with any DOGE personnel. The message informed NLRB employees that two DOGE representatives would be detailed to the agency part-time for several months.</p>
<div id="attachment_71041" style="width: 561px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71041" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-71041" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/nlrb-dir-emailapril14.png" alt="" width="551" height="568" /><p id="caption-attachment-71041" class="wp-caption-text">An email from the NLRB Director Lasharn Hamilton on April 16, stating that the agency previously had no contact with DOGE personnel.</p></div>
<p>Berulis told KrebsOnSecurity he was in the process of filing a support ticket with Microsoft to request more information about the DOGE accounts when his network administrator access was restricted. Now, he&#8217;s hoping lawmakers will ask Microsoft to provide more information about what really happened with the accounts.</p>
<p>&#8220;That would give us way more insight,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Microsoft has to be able to see the picture better than we can. That&#8217;s my goal, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>Berulis&#8217;s attorney told lawmakers that on April 7, while his client and legal team were preparing the whistleblower complaint, someone physically taped a threatening note to Mr. Berulis&#8217;s home door with photographs &#8212; taken via drone &#8212; of him walking in his neighborhood.</p>
<p>&#8220;The threatening note made clear reference to this very disclosure he was preparing for you, as the proper oversight authority,&#8221; reads a preface by Berulis&#8217;s attorney <strong>Andrew P. Bakaj</strong>. &#8220;While we do not know specifically who did this, we can only speculate that it involved someone with the ability to access NLRB systems.&#8221;</p>
<p>Berulis said the response from friends, colleagues and even the public has been largely supportive, and that he doesn&#8217;t regret his decision to come forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t expect the letter on my door or the pushback from [agency] leaders,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If I had to do it over, would I do it again? Yes, because it wasn&#8217;t really even a choice the first time.&#8221;</p>
<p>For now, Mr. Berulis is taking some paid family leave from the NLRB. Which is just as well, he said, considering he was stripped of the tools needed to do his job at the agency.</p>
<p>&#8220;They came in and took full administrative control and locked everyone out, and said limited permission will be assigned on a need basis going forward&#8221; Berulis said of the DOGE employees. &#8220;We can&#8217;t really do anything, so we&#8217;re literally getting paid to count ceiling tiles.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A critical resource that cybersecurity professionals worldwide rely on to identify, mitigate and fix security vulnerabilities in software and hardware is in danger of breaking down. The federally funded, non-profit research and development organization <strong>MITRE</strong> warned today that its contract to maintain the <strong>Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures</strong> (CVE) program &#8212; which is traditionally funded each year by the Department of Homeland Security &#8212; expires on April 16.</p>
<div id="attachment_71016" style="width: 752px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71016" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-71016" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mitreletter.png" alt="" width="742" height="942" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mitreletter.png 788w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mitreletter-768x975.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mitreletter-782x992.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 742px) 100vw, 742px" /><p id="caption-attachment-71016" class="wp-caption-text">A letter from MITRE vice president Yosry Barsoum, warning that the funding for the CVE program will expire on April 16, 2025.</p></div>
<p>Tens of thousands of security flaws in software are found and reported every year, and these vulnerabilities are eventually assigned their own unique CVE tracking number (e.g. <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-43573" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2024-43573</a>, which is a <strong>Microsoft Windows</strong> bug that Redmond patched last year).</p>
<p>There are hundreds of organizations &#8212; known as <strong>CVE Numbering Authorities</strong> (CNAs) &#8212; that are authorized by MITRE to bestow these CVE numbers on newly reported flaws. Many of these CNAs are country and government-specific, or tied to individual software vendors or vulnerability disclosure platforms (a.k.a. bug bounty programs).</p>
<p>Put simply, MITRE is a critical, widely-used resource for centralizing and standardizing information on software vulnerabilities. That means the pipeline of information it supplies is plugged into an array of cybersecurity tools and services that help organizations identify and patch security holes &#8212; ideally before malware or malcontents can wriggle through them.</p>
<p>&#8220;What the CVE lists really provide is a standardized way to describe the severity of that defect, and a centralized repository listing which versions of which products are defective and need to be updated,&#8221; said <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/contributors/mtait" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matt Tait</a>, chief operating officer of <strong>Corellium</strong>, a cybersecurity firm that sells phone-virtualization software for finding security flaws.</p>
<p>In a letter sent today to the CVE board, MITRE Vice President <strong>Yosry Barsoum </strong>warned that on April 16, 2025, &#8220;the current contracting pathway for MITRE to develop, operate and modernize CVE and several other related programs will expire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If a break in service were to occur, we anticipate multiple impacts to CVE, including deterioration of national vulnerability databases and advisories, tool vendors, incident response operations, and all manner of critical infrastructure,&#8221; Barsoum wrote.</p>
<p>MITRE told KrebsOnSecurity the CVE website listing vulnerabilities will remain up after the funding expires, but that new CVEs won&#8217;t be added after April 16.</p>
<div id="attachment_71017" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CVE-Lifecycle.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71017" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-71017" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CVE-Lifecycle.png" alt="" width="750" height="335" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CVE-Lifecycle.png 1926w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CVE-Lifecycle-768x343.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CVE-Lifecycle-1536x686.png 1536w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CVE-Lifecycle-782x349.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-71017" class="wp-caption-text">A representation of how a vulnerability becomes a CVE, and how that information is consumed.

<p>DHS officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The program is funded through DHS&#8217;s <strong>Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency</strong> (CISA), which is currently facing <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/04/trump-revenge-tour-targets-cyber-leaders-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deep budget and staffing cuts by the Trump administration</a>. The <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_70RCSJ24FR0000019_7001_70RSAT20D00000001_7001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE contract</a> available at USAspending.gov says the project was awarded approximately $40 million last year.<br />
<span id="more-71010"></span></p>
<p>Former CISA Director<strong> Jen Easterly</strong> said the CVE program is a bit like the Dewey Decimal System, but for cybersecurity.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s the global catalog that helps everyone—security teams, software vendors, researchers, governments—organize and talk about vulnerabilities using the same reference system,&#8221; Easterly said in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7318021583191617538/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a post on LinkedIn</a>. &#8220;Without it, everyone is using a different catalog or no catalog at all, no one knows if they’re talking about the same problem, defenders waste precious time figuring out what’s wrong, and worst of all, threat actors take advantage of the confusion.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>John Hammond</strong>, principal security researcher at the managed security firm <strong>Huntress</strong>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-funding-running-out-critical-cyber-vulnerability-database-manager-says-2025-04-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told Reuters</a> he swore out loud when he heard the news that CVE&#8217;s funding was in jeopardy, and that losing the CVE program would be like losing &#8220;the language and lingo we used to address problems in cybersecurity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I really can&#8217;t help but think this is just going to hurt,&#8221; said Hammond, who posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itbsfeqrRY4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Youtube video</a> to vent about the situation and alert others.</p>
<p>Several people close to the matter told KrebsOnSecurity this is not the first time the CVE program&#8217;s budget has been left in funding limbo until the last minute. Barsoum&#8217;s letter, which was apparently leaked, sounded a hopeful note, saying the government is making &#8220;considerable efforts to continue MITRE&#8217;s role in support of the program.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tait said that without the CVE program, risk managers inside companies would need to continuously monitor many other places for information about new vulnerabilities that may jeopardize the security of their IT networks. Meaning, it may become more common that software updates get mis-prioritized, with companies having hackable software deployed for longer than they otherwise would, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hopefully they will resolve this, but otherwise the list will rapidly fall out of date and stop being useful,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><strong>Update, April 16, 11:00 a.m. ET:</strong> The CVE board today announced the creation of non-profit entity called <strong>The CVE Foundation </strong>that will continue the program&#8217;s work under a new, unspecified funding mechanism and organizational structure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since its inception, the CVE Program has operated as a U.S. government-funded initiative, with oversight and management provided under contract,&#8221; the press release reads. &#8220;While this structure has supported the program&#8217;s growth, it has also raised longstanding concerns among members of the CVE Board about the sustainability and neutrality of a globally relied-upon resource being tied to a single government sponsor.&#8221;</p>
<p>The organization&#8217;s website, <a href="https://www.thecvefoundation.org/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thecvefoundation.org</a>, is less than a day old and currently hosts no content other than the press release heralding its creation. The announcement said the foundation would release more information about its structure and transition planning in the coming days.</p>
<p><strong>Update, April 16, 4:26 p.m. ET:</strong> MITRE issued a statement today saying it &#8220;identified incremental funding to keep the programs operational. We appreciate the overwhelming support for these programs that have been expressed by the global cyber community, industry and government over the last 24 hours. The government continues to make considerable efforts to support MITRE&#8217;s role in the program and MITRE remains committed to CVE and CWE as global resources.&#8221;</p>
