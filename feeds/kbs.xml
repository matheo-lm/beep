										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In May 2025, the U.S. government sanctioned a Chinese national for operating a cloud provider linked to the majority of virtual currency investment scam websites reported to the FBI. But a new report finds the accused continues to operate a slew of established accounts at American tech companies &#8212; including <strong>Facebook</strong>, <strong>Github</strong>, <strong>PayPal</strong> and <strong>Twitter/X</strong>.</p>
<p>On May 29, the <strong>U.S. Department of the Treasury</strong>Â <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/05/u-s-sanctions-cloud-provider-funnull-as-top-source-of-pig-butchering-scams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced economic sanctions</a> against <strong>Funnull Technology Inc.</strong>, a Philippines-based company alleged to provide infrastructure for hundreds of thousands of websites involved in virtual currency investment scams known as &#8220;<a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/07/massive-losses-define-epidemic-of-pig-butchering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pig butchering</a>.&#8221; In January 2025, KrebsOnSecurity detailed how Funnull was designed as a content delivery network that catered to <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/01/infrastructure-laundering-blending-in-with-the-cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">foreign cybercriminals seeking to route their traffic through U.S.-based cloud providers</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-71586" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/lizhisanctions.png" alt="" width="663" height="569" /></p>
<p>The Treasury also sanctioned Funnull&#8217;s alleged operator, a 40-year-old Chinese national named <strong>Liu &#8220;Steve&#8221; Lizhi</strong>. The government says Funnull directly facilitated financial schemes resulting in more than $200 million in financial losses by Americans, and that the company&#8217;s operations were linked to the majority of pig butchering scams reported to the FBI.</p>
<p>It is generally illegal for U.S. companies or individuals to transact with people sanctioned by the Treasury. However, as Mr. Lizhi&#8217;s case makes clear, just because someone is sanctioned doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean big tech companies are going to suspend their online accounts.</p>
<p>The government says Lizhi was born November 13, 1984, and used the nicknames &#8220;<strong>XXL4</strong>&#8221; and &#8220;<strong>Nice Lizhi</strong>.&#8221; Nevertheless, Steve Liu&#8217;s 17-year-old account on LinkedIn (in the name &#8220;Liulizhi&#8221;) had hundreds of followers (Lizhi&#8217;s LinkedIn profile helpfully confirms his birthday) until quite recently: The account was deleted this morning, just hours after KrebsOnSecurity sought comment from LinkedIn.</p>
<div id="attachment_71584" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71584" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-71584" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/linkedin-liu.png" alt="" width="750" height="623" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/linkedin-liu.png 789w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/linkedin-liu-768x638.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/linkedin-liu-782x649.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><p id="caption-attachment-71584" class="wp-caption-text">Mr. Lizhi&#8217;s LinkedIn account was suspended sometime in the last 24 hours, after KrebsOnSecurity sought comment from LinkedIn.</p></div>
<p>In an emailed response, a LinkedIn spokesperson said the company&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1339324/prohibited-countries-policy?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prohibited countries policy</a>&#8221; states that LinkedIn &#8220;does not sell, license, support or otherwise make available its Premium accounts or other <strong>paid</strong> products and services to individuals and companies sanctioned by the U.S. government.&#8221; LinkedIn declined to say whether the profile in question was a premium or free account.</p>
<p>Mr. Lizhi also maintains <a href="https://paypal.com/paypalme/nicelizhi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a working PayPal account</a> under the name Liu Lizhi and username &#8220;<strong>@nicelizhi</strong>,&#8221; another nickname listed in the Treasury sanctions. PayPal did not respond to a request for comment. A 15-year-old <a href="https://x.com/phpedu/with_replies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter/X account named &#8220;Lizhi&#8221;</a> that links to Mr. Lizhi&#8217;s personal domain remains active, although it has few followers and hasn&#8217;t posted in years.</p>
<p>These accounts and many others were flagged by the security firm <strong>Silent Push</strong>, which has been tracking Funnull&#8217;s operations for the past year and calling out U.S. cloud providers like <strong>Amazon</strong> and <strong>Microsoft</strong> for failing to more quickly sever ties with the company.</p>
<div id="attachment_71588" style="width: 759px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71588" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-71588" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/pp-lizhi.png" alt="" width="749" height="471" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/pp-lizhi.png 816w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/pp-lizhi-768x483.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/pp-lizhi-782x492.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" /><p id="caption-attachment-71588" class="wp-caption-text">Liu Lizhi&#8217;s PayPal account.</p></div>
<p>In <a href="https://www.silentpush.com/blog/funnull-admin-sanctions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a report</a> released today, Silent Push found Lizhi still operates numerous Facebook accounts and groups, including a private Facebook account under the name Liu Lizhi. Another Facebook account clearly connected to Lizhi is a tourism page for Ganzhou, China called &#8220;<strong>EnjoyGanzhou</strong>&#8221; that was named in the Treasury Department sanctions.</p>
<p>&#8220;This guy is the technical administrator for the infrastructure that is hosting a majority of scams targeting people in the United States, and hundreds of millions have been lost based on the websites he&#8217;s been hosting,&#8221; said <strong>Zach Edwards</strong>, senior threat researcher at Silent Push. &#8220;It&#8217;s crazy that the vast majority of big tech companies haven&#8217;t done anything to cut ties with this guy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The FBI says it received nearly 150,000 complaints last year involving digital assets and $9.3 billion in losses &#8212; a 66 percent increase from the previous year. Investment scams were the top crypto-related crimes reported, with $5.8 billion in losses.<span id="more-71564"></span></p>
<p>In a statement, a Meta spokesperson said the company continuously takes steps to meet its legal obligations, but that sanctions laws are complex and varied. They explained that sanctions are often targeted in nature and don&#8217;t always prohibit people from having a presence on its platform. Nevertheless, Meta confirmed it had removed the account, unpublished Pages, and removed Groups and events associated with the user for violating its policies.</p>
<p>Attempts to reach Mr. Lizhi via his primary email addresses at <strong>Hotmail</strong> and <strong>Gmail</strong> bounced as undeliverable. Likewise, his 14-year-old <strong>YouTube</strong> channel appears to have been taken down recently.</p>
<p>However, anyone interested in viewing or using Mr. Lizhi&#8217;s 146 computer code repositories will have no problem finding GitHub accounts for him, including one registered under the NiceLizhi and XXL4 nicknames mentioned in the Treasury sanctions.</p>
<div id="attachment_71587" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71587" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-71587" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/xxl4-github.png" alt="" width="750" height="515" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/xxl4-github.png 1131w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/xxl4-github-768x528.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/xxl4-github-782x538.png 782w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/xxl4-github-100x70.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><p id="caption-attachment-71587" class="wp-caption-text">One of multiple GitHub profiles used by Liu &#8220;Steve&#8221; Lizhi, who uses the nickname XXL4 (a moniker listed in the Treasury sanctions for Mr. Lizhi).</p></div>
<p>Mr. Lizhi also operates a GitHub page for an open source e-commerce platform called <strong>NexaMerchant</strong>, which advertises itself as a payment gateway working with numerous American financial institutions. Interestingly, this profile&#8217;s <a href="https://www.github.com/orgs/NexaMerchant/follower" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;followers&#8221; page</a> shows several other accounts that appear to be Mr. Lizhi&#8217;s. All of the account&#8217;s followers are tagged as &#8220;suspended,&#8221; even though that suspended message does not display when one visits those individual profiles.</p>
<p>In response to questions, GitHub said it has a process in place to identify when users and customers are Specially Designated Nationals or other denied or blocked parties, but that it locks those accounts instead of removing them. According to its policy, GitHub takes care that users and customers aren&#8217;t impacted beyond what is required by law.</p>
<div id="attachment_71595" style="width: 758px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71595" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-71595" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/nexamerchant.png" alt="" width="748" height="493" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/nexamerchant.png 1225w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/nexamerchant-768x507.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/nexamerchant-782x516.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px" /><p id="caption-attachment-71595" class="wp-caption-text">All of the follower accounts for the XXL4 GitHub account appear to be Mr. Lizhi&#8217;s, and have been suspended by GitHub, but their code is still accessible.</p></div>
<p>&#8220;This includes keeping public repositories, including those for open source projects, available and accessible to support personal communications involving developers in sanctioned regions,&#8221; the policy states. &#8220;This also means GitHub will advocate for developers in sanctioned regions to enjoy greater access to the platform and full access to the global open source community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Edwards said it&#8217;s great that GitHub has a process for handling sanctioned accounts, but that the process doesn&#8217;t seem to communicate risk in a transparent way, noting that the only indicator on the locked accounts is the message, &#8220;This repository has been archived by the owner. It is not read-only.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an odd message that doesn&#8217;t communicate, &#8216;This is a sanctioned entity, don&#8217;t fork this code or use it in a production environment&#8217;,&#8221; Edwards said.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Rasch</strong> is a former federal cybercrime prosecutor who now serves as counsel for the New York City based security consulting firm <strong>Unit 221B</strong>. Rasch said when Treasury&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions a person or entity, it then becomes illegal for businesses or organizations to transact with the sanctioned party.</p>
<p>Rasch said financial institutions have very mature systems for severing accounts tied to people who become subject to OFAC sanctions, but that tech companies may be far less proactive &#8212; particularly with free accounts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Banks have established ways of checking [U.S. government sanctions lists] for sanctioned entities, but tech companies don&#8217;t necessarily do a good job with that, especially for services that you can just click and sign up for,&#8221; Rasch said. &#8220;It&#8217;s potentially a risk and liability for the tech companies involved, but only to the extent OFAC is willing to enforce it.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_71589" style="width: 783px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71589" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-71589" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/fb-ganzhou.png" alt="" width="773" height="651" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/fb-ganzhou.png 773w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/fb-ganzhou-768x647.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 773px) 100vw, 773px" /><p id="caption-attachment-71589" class="wp-caption-text">Liu Lizhi operates numerous Facebook accounts and groups, including this one for an entity specified in the OFAC sanctions: The &#8220;Enjoy Ganzhou&#8221; tourism page for Ganzhou, China. Image: Silent Push.</p></div>
<p>In July 2024, Funnull purchased the domain polyfill[.]io, the longtime home of a legitimate open source project that allowed websites to ensure that devices using legacy browsers could still render content in newer formats. After the Polyfill domain changed hands, at least 384,000 websites were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/07/384000-sites-link-to-code-library-caught-performing-supply-chain-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caught in a supply-chain attack</a> that redirected visitors to malicious sites. According to the Treasury, Funnull used the code to redirect people to scam websites and online gambling sites, some of which were linked to Chinese criminal money laundering operations.</p>
<p>The U.S. government says Funnull provides domain names for websites on its purchased IP addresses, using domain generation algorithms (DGAs) â programs that generate large numbers of similar but unique names for websites â and that it sells web design templates to cybercriminals.</p>
<p>&#8220;These services not only make it easier for cybercriminals to impersonate trusted brands when creating scam websites, but also allow them to quickly change to different domain names and IP addresses when legitimate providers attempt to take the websites down,&#8221; reads a Treasury statement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Funnull appears to be morphing nearly all aspects of its business in the wake of the sanctions, Edwards said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whereas before they might have used 60 DGA domains to hide and bounce their traffic, we&#8217;re seeing far more now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They&#8217;re trying to make their infrastructure harder to track and more complicated, so for now they&#8217;re not going away but more just changing what they&#8217;re doing. And a lot more organizations should be holding their feet to the fire.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Update, 2:48 PM ET: </strong>Added response from Meta, which confirmed it has closed the accounts and groups connected to Mr. Lizhi.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Agents with the <strong>Federal Bureau of Investigation</strong> (FBI) briefed Capitol Hill staff recently on hardening the security of their mobile devices, after a contacts list stolen from the personal phone of the White House Chief of Staff <strong>Susie Wiles</strong> was reportedly used to fuel a series of text messages and phone calls impersonating her to U.S. lawmakers. But in a letter this week to the FBI, one of the Senate&#8217;s most tech-savvy lawmakers says the feds aren&#8217;t doing enough to recommend more appropriate security protections that are already built into most consumer mobile devices.</p>
<div id="attachment_71570" style="width: 762px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71570" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-71570" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/wyden-patel-letter.png" alt="" width="752" height="822" /><p id="caption-attachment-71570" class="wp-caption-text">A screenshot of the first page from Sen. Wyden&#8217;s letter to FBI Director Kash Patel.</p></div>
<p>On May 29, <strong>The Wall Street Journal</strong> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/federal-authorities-probe-effort-to-impersonate-white-house-chief-of-staff-65da0d59" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that federal authorities were investigating a clandestine effort to impersonate Ms. Wiles via text messages and in phone calls that may have used AI to spoof her voice. According to The Journal, Wiles told associates her cellphone contacts were hacked, giving the impersonator access to the private phone numbers of some of the country&#8217;s most influential people.</p>
<p>The execution of this phishing and impersonation campaign &#8212; whatever its goals may have been &#8212; suggested the attackers were financially motivated, and not particularly sophisticated.</p>
<p>&#8220;It became clear to some of the lawmakers that the requests were suspicious when the impersonator began asking questions about Trump that Wiles should have known the answers toâand in one case, when the impersonator asked for a cash transfer, some of the people said,&#8221; the Journal wrote. &#8220;In many cases, the impersonatorâs grammar was broken and the messages were more formal than the way Wiles typically communicates, people who have received the messages said. The calls and text messages also didnât come from Wilesâs phone number.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sophisticated or not, the impersonation campaign was soon <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/after-two-day-manhunt-suspect-charged-shooting-two-minnesota-lawmakers-and-their-spouses" target="_blank" rel="noopener">punctuated</a> by the murder of Minnesota House of Representatives Speaker <strong>Emerita Melissa Hortman</strong> and her husband, and the shooting of Minnesota State Senator <strong>John Hoffman</strong> and his wife. So when FBI agents offered in mid-June to brief U.S. Senate staff on mobile threats, more than 140 staffers took them up on that invitation (a remarkably high number considering that no food was offered at the event).</p>
<p>But according to <strong>Sen. Ron Wyden</strong> (D-Ore.), the advice the FBI provided to Senate staffers was largely limited to remedial tips, such as not clicking on suspicious links or attachments, not using public wifi networks, turning off bluetooth, keeping phone software up to date, and rebooting regularly.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is insufficient to protect Senate employees and other high-value targets against foreign spies using advanced cyber tools,&#8221; Wyden wrote in <a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/download/wyden-letter-to-fbi-defensive-cyber-advice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a letter</a> sent today to <strong>FBI Director Kash Patel</strong>. &#8220;Well-funded foreign intelligence agencies do not have to rely on phishing messages and malicious attachments to infect unsuspecting victims with spyware. Cyber mercenary companies sell their government customers advanced &#8216;zero-click&#8217; capabilities to deliver spyware that do not require any action by the victim.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wyden stressed that to help counter sophisticated attacks, the FBI should be encouraging lawmakers and their staff to enable anti-spyware defenses that are built into Apple&#8217;s iOS and Google&#8217;s Android phone software.</p>
<p>These include Apple&#8217;s <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/105120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lockdown Mode</a>, which is designed for users who are worried they may be subject to targeted attacks. Lockdown Mode restricts non-essential iOS features to reduce the device&#8217;s overall attack surface. Google Android devices carry a similar feature called <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/9764949?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advanced Protection Mode</a>.</p>
<p>Wyden also urged the FBI to update its training to recommend a number of other steps that people can take to make their mobile devices less trackable, including the use of ad blockers to guard against malicious advertisements, <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/10/the-global-surveillance-free-for-all-in-mobile-ad-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disabling ad tracking IDs in mobile devices</a>, and opting out of commercial data brokers (the suspect charged in the Minnesota shootings reportedly <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/minnshooting-peoplesearch.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used multiple people-search services</a> to find the home addresses of his targets).<span id="more-71553"></span></p>
<p>The senator&#8217;s letter notes that while the FBI has recommended all of the above precautions in various advisories issued over the years, the advice the agency is giving now to the nation&#8217;s leaders needs to be more comprehensive, actionable and urgent.</p>
<p>&#8220;In spite of the seriousness of the threat, the FBI has yet to provide effective defensive guidance,&#8221; Wyden said.</p>
<p><strong>Nicholas Weaver </strong>is a researcher with the <strong>International Computer Science Institute</strong>, a nonprofit in Berkeley, Calif. Weaver said Lockdown Mode or Advanced Protection will mitigate many vulnerabilities, and should be the default setting for all members of Congress and their staff.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lawmakers are at exceptional risk and need to be exceptionally protected,&#8221; Weaver said. &#8220;Their computers should be locked down and well administered, etc. And the same applies to staffers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Weaver noted that Apple&#8217;s Lockdown Mode has a track record of blocking zero-day attacks on iOS applications; in September 2023, <strong>Citizen Lab</strong> <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/09/adobe-apple-google-microsoft-patch-0-day-bugs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documented</a> how Lockdown Mode foiled a zero-click flaw capable of installing spyware on iOS devices without any interaction from the victim.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61232" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/lockdownmode.png" alt="" width="314" height="629" /></p>
<p>Earlier this month, Citizen Lab researchers <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2025/06/first-forensic-confirmation-of-paragons-ios-mercenary-spyware-finds-journalists-targeted/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documented a zero-click attack</a> used to infect the iOS devices of two journalists with Paragon&#8217;s Graphite spyware. The vulnerability could be exploited merely by sending the target a booby-trapped media file delivered via iMessage. Apple also recently updated its advisory for the zero-click flaw (CVE-2025-43200), noting that it was mitigated as of iOS 18.3.1, which was released in February 2025.</p>
<p>Apple has not commented on whether CVE-2025-43200 could be exploited on devices with Lockdown Mode turned on. But HelpNetSecurity <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2025/06/13/ios-zero-click-attacks-used-to-deliver-graphite-spyware-cve-2025-43200/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">observed</a> that at the same time Apple addressed CVE-2025-43200 back in February, the company fixed another vulnerability flagged by Citizen Lab researcher <strong>Bill Marczak</strong>: <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/122174" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2025-24200</a>, which Apple said was used in an extremely sophisticated <em>physical</em> attack against specific targeted individuals that allowed attackers to disable USB Restricted Mode on a locked device.</p>
<p>In other words, the flaw could apparently be exploited only if the attacker had physical access to the targeted vulnerable device. And as the old infosec industry adage goes, if an adversary has physical access to your device, it&#8217;s most likely not your device anymore.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t speak to Google&#8217;s Advanced Protection Mode personally, because I don&#8217;t use Google or Android devices. But I have had Apple&#8217;s Lockdown Mode enabled on all of my Apple devices since it was first made available in September 2022. I can only think of a single occasion when one of my apps failed to work properly with Lockdown Mode turned on, and in that case I was able to add a temporary exception for that app in Lockdown Mode&#8217;s settings.</p>
<p>My main gripe with Lockdown Mode was captured in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/13/apples-lockdown-mode-is-good-for-security-but-its-notifications-are-baffling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a March 2025 column</a> by TechCrunch&#8217;s <strong>Lorenzo Francheschi-Bicchierai</strong>, who wrote about its penchant for periodically sending mystifying notifications that someone has been blocked from contacting you, even though nothing then prevents you from contacting that person directly. This has happened to me at least twice, and in both cases the person in question was already an approved contact, and said they had not attempted to reach out.</p>
<p>Although it would be nice if Apple&#8217;s Lockdown Mode sent fewer, less alarming and more informative alerts, the occasional baffling warning message is hardly enough to make me turn it off.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Late last year, security researchers made a startling discovery: Kremlin-backed disinformation campaigns were bypassing moderation on social media platforms by leveraging the same malicious advertising technology that powers a sprawling ecosystem of online hucksters and website hackers. A new report on the fallout from that investigation finds this dark ad tech industry is far more resilient and incestuous than previously known.</p>
<div id="attachment_71492" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71492" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-71492" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/maladtech.png" alt="" width="750" height="422" /><p id="caption-attachment-71492" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Infoblox.</p></div>
<p>In November 2024, researchers at the security firm <strong>Qurium</strong> published an investigation into &#8220;<a href="https://www.cybercom.mil/Media/News/Article/3895345/russian-disinformation-campaign-doppelgnger-unmasked-a-web-of-deception/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Doppelganger</a>,&#8221; a disinformation network that promotes pro-Russian narratives and infiltrates Europe&#8217;s media landscape by pushing fake news through a network of cloned websites.</p>
<p>Doppelganger campaigns use specialized links that bounce the visitor&#8217;s browser through a long series of domains before the fake news content is served. Qurium <a href="https://www.qurium.org/forensics/when-kehr-meets-vextrio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> Doppelganger relies on a sophisticated &#8220;domain cloaking&#8221; service, a technology that allows websites to present different content to search engines compared to what regular visitors see. The use of cloaking services helps the disinformation sites remain online longer than they otherwise would, while ensuring that only the targeted audience gets to view the intended content.</p>
<p>Qurium discovered that Doppelganger&#8217;s cloaking service also promoted online dating sites, and shared much of the same infrastructure with <strong>VexTrio</strong>, which is thought to be the oldest malicious traffic distribution system (TDS) in existence. While TDSs are commonly used by legitimate advertising networks to manage traffic from disparate sources and to track who or what is behind each click, VexTrio&#8217;s TDS largely manages web traffic from victims of phishing, malware, and social engineering scams.</p>
<h2>BREAKING BAD</h2>
<p>Digging deeper, Qurium noticed Doppelganger&#8217;s cloaking service used an Internet provider in Switzerland as the first entry point in a chain of domain redirections. They also noticed the same infrastructure hosted a pair of co-branded affiliate marketing services that were driving traffic to sketchy adult dating sites: <strong>LosPollos[.]com</strong> and <strong>TacoLoco[.]co</strong>.</p>
<p>The LosPollos ad network incorporates many elements and references from the hit series &#8220;Breaking Bad,&#8221; mirroring the fictional &#8220;Los Pollos Hermanos&#8221; restaurant chain that served as a money laundering operation for a violent methamphetamine cartel.</p>
<div id="attachment_71484" style="width: 759px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71484" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-71484" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/lospollos_mainpage.png" alt="" width="749" height="497" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/lospollos_mainpage.png 2710w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/lospollos_mainpage-768x510.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/lospollos_mainpage-1536x1020.png 1536w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/lospollos_mainpage-2048x1360.png 2048w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/lospollos_mainpage-782x519.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" /><p id="caption-attachment-71484" class="wp-caption-text">The LosPollos advertising network invokes characters and themes from the hit show Breaking Bad. The logo for LosPollos (upper left) is the image of Gustavo Fring, the fictional chicken restaurant chain owner in the show.</p></div>
<p>Affiliates who sign up with LosPollos are given JavaScript-heavy &#8220;<strong>smartlinks</strong>&#8221; that drive traffic into the VexTrio TDS, which in turn distributes the traffic among a variety of advertising partners, including dating services, sweepstakes offers, bait-and-switch mobile apps, financial scams and malware download sites.</p>
<p>LosPollos affiliates typically stitch these smart links into <strong>WordPress</strong> websites that have been hacked via known vulnerabilities, and those affiliates will earn a small commission each time an Internet user referred by any of their hacked sites falls for one of these lures.</p>
<div id="attachment_71485" style="width: 755px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71485" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-71485" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/lospollos_subdomain_linkedIn_announcement.png" alt="" width="745" height="321" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/lospollos_subdomain_linkedIn_announcement.png 1146w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/lospollos_subdomain_linkedIn_announcement-768x331.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/lospollos_subdomain_linkedIn_announcement-782x337.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px" /><p id="caption-attachment-71485" class="wp-caption-text">The Los Pollos advertising network promoting itself on LinkedIn.</p></div>
<p>According to Qurium, TacoLoco is a traffic monetization network that uses deceptive tactics to trick Internet users into enabling &#8220;push notifications,&#8221; a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8030" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cross-platform browser standard</a> that allows websites to show pop-up messages which appear outside of the browser. For example, on Microsoft Windows systems these notifications typically show up in the bottom right corner of the screen â just above the system clock.</p>
<p>In the case of VexTrio and TacoLoco, the notification approval requests themselves are deceptive â disguised as âCAPTCHAâ challenges designed to distinguish automated bot traffic from real visitors. For years, VexTrio and its partners have successfully tricked countless users into enabling these site notifications, which are then used to continuously pepper the victim&#8217;s device with a variety of phony virus alerts and misleading pop-up messages.</p>
<div id="attachment_71486" style="width: 759px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71486" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-71486" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/maliciouspushcaptcha.png" alt="" width="749" height="643" /><p id="caption-attachment-71486" class="wp-caption-text">Examples of VexTrio landing pages that lead users to accept push notifications on their device.</p></div>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/resources/news/godaddy-annual-cybersecurity-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a December 2024 annual report</a> from <strong>GoDaddy</strong>, <em>nearly 40 percent of compromised websites in 2024 redirected visitors to VexTrio via LosPollos smartlinks</em>.<span id="more-69927"></span></p>
<h2>ADSPRO AND TEKNOLOGY</h2>
<p>On November 14, 2024, Qurium <a href="https://www.qurium.org/forensics/when-kehr-meets-vextrio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published research</a> to support its findings that LosPollos and TacoLoco were services operated by <strong>Adspro Group</strong>, a company registered in the Czech Republic and Russia, and that Adspro runs its infrastructure at the Swiss hosting providers <strong>C41</strong> and <strong>Teknology SA</strong>.</p>
<p>Qurium noted the LosPollos and TacoLoco sites state that their content is copyrighted by <strong>ByteCore AG</strong> and <strong>SkyForge Digital AG</strong>, both Swiss firms that are run by the owner of Teknology SA, <strong>Giulio Vitorrio Leonardo Cerutti</strong>. Further investigation revealed LosPollos and TacoLoco were apps developed by a company called <strong>Holacode</strong>, which lists Cerutti as its CEO.</p>
<p>The apps marketed by Holacode include numerous VPN services, as well as one called <strong>Spamshield</strong> that claims to stop unwanted push notifications. But in January, Infoblox said they tested the app on their own mobile devices, and found it hides the user&#8217;s notifications, and then after 24 hours stops hiding them and demands payment. Spamshield subsequently changed its developer name from Holacode to <strong>ApLabz</strong>, although Infoblox noted that the Terms of Service for several of the rebranded ApLabz apps still referenced Holacode in their terms of service.</p>
<p>Incredibly, Cerutti threatened to sue me for defamation before I&#8217;d even uttered his name or sent him a request for comment (Cerutti sent the unsolicited legal threat back in January after his company and my name were merely tagged in an Infoblox post on LinkedIn about VexTrio).</p>
<p>Asked to comment on the findings by Qurium and Infoblox, Cerutti vehemently denied being associated with VexTrio. Cerutti asserted that his companies all strictly adhere to the regulations of the countries in which they operate, and that they have been completely transparent about all of their operations.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are a group operating in the advertising and marketing space, with an affiliate network program,&#8221; Cerutti responded. &#8220;I am not [going] to say we are perfect, but I strongly declare we have no connection with VexTrio at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, as a big player in this space we also get to deal with plenty of publisher fraud, sketchy traffic, fake clicks, bots, hacked, listed and resold publisher accounts, etc, etc.,&#8221; Cerutti continued. &#8220;We bleed lots of money to such malpractices and conduct regular internal screenings and audits in a constant battle to remove bad traffic sources. It is also a highly competitive space, where some upstarts will often play dirty against more established mainstream players like us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Working with Qurium, researchers at the security firm <strong>Infoblox</strong> released details about VexTrio&#8217;s infrastructure to their industry partners. Just four days after Qurium published its findings, LosPollos announced it was suspending its push monetization service. Less than a month later, Adspro had rebranded to <strong>Aimed Global</strong>.</p>

Click to enlarge.</p></div>
<h2>A REVEALING PIVOT</h2>
<p>In March 2025, researchers at GoDaddy <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/resources/news/dollyway-malware-c2-tds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chronicled</a> how <strong>DollyWay</strong> &#8212; a malware strain that has consistently redirected victims to VexTrio throughout its eight years of activity &#8212; suddenly stopped doing that on November 20, 2024. Virtually overnight, DollyWay and several other malware families that had previously used VexTrio began pushing their traffic through another TDS called <strong>Help TDS</strong>.</p>
<p>Digging further into historical DNS records and the unique code scripts used by the Help TDS, Infoblox determined it has long enjoyed an exclusive relationship with VexTrio (at least until LosPollos ended its push monetization service in November).</p>
<p>In <a href="https://blogs.infoblox.com/threat-intelligence/vexing-and-vicious-the-eerie-relationship-between-wordpress-hackers-and-an-adtech-cabal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a report released today</a>, Infoblox said an exhaustive analysis of the JavaScript code, website lures, smartlinks and DNS patterns used by VexTrio and Help TDS linked them with at least four other TDS operators (not counting TacoLoco). Those four entities &#8212; <strong>Partners House</strong>, <strong>BroPush</strong>, <strong>RichAds</strong> and <strong>RexPush</strong> &#8212; are all Russia-based push monetization programs that pay affiliates to drive signups for a variety of schemes, but mostly online dating services.</p>
<p>&#8220;As Los Pollos push monetization ended, we&#8217;ve seen an increase in fake CAPTCHAs that drive user acceptance of push notifications, particularly from Partners House,&#8221; the Infoblox report reads. &#8220;The relationship of these commercial entities remains a mystery; while they are certainly long-time partners redirecting traffic to one another, and they all have a Russian nexus, there is no overt common ownership.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Renee Burton</strong>, vice president of threat intelligence at Infoblox, said the security industry generally treats the deceptive methods used by VexTrio and other malicious TDSs as a kind of legally grey area that is mostly associated with less dangerous security threats, such as adware and scareware.</p>
<p>But Burton argues that this view is myopic, and helps perpetuate a dark adtech industry that also pushes plenty of straight-up malware, noting that hundreds of thousands of compromised websites around the world every year redirect victims to the tangled web of VexTrio and VexTrio-affiliate TDSs.</p>
<p>&#8220;These TDSs are a nefarious threat, because they&#8217;re the ones you can connect to the delivery of things like information stealers and scams that cost consumers billions of dollars a year,&#8221; Burton said. &#8220;From a larger strategic perspective, my takeaway is that Russian organized crime has control of malicious adtech, and these are just some of the many groups involved.&#8221;</p>
<h2>WHAT CAN YOU DO?</h2>
<p>As KrebsOnSecurity <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/11/be-very-sparing-in-allowing-site-notifications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">warned way back in 2020</a>, it&#8217;s a good idea to be very sparing in approving notifications when browsing the Web. In many cases these notifications are benign, but as we&#8217;ve seen there are numerous dodgy firms that are paying site owners to install their notification scripts, and then reselling that communications pathway to scammers and online hucksters.</p>
<p>If youâd like to prevent sites from ever presenting notification requests, all of the major browser makers let you do this &#8212; either across the board or on a per-website basis. While it is true that blocking notifications entirely can break the functionality of some websites, doing this for any devices you manage on behalf of your less tech-savvy friends or family members might end up saving everyone a lot of headache down the road.</p>
<p>To modify site notification settings in <strong>Mozilla Firefox</strong>, navigate to Settings, Privacy &amp; Security, Permissions, and click the &#8220;Settings&#8221; tab next to &#8220;Notifications.&#8221; That page will display any notifications already permitted and allow you to edit or delete any entries. Tick the box next to &#8220;Block new requests asking to allow notifications&#8221; to stop them altogether.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-71514" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/firefox-notifications.png" alt="" width="750" height="542" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/firefox-notifications.png 1185w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/firefox-notifications-768x555.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/firefox-notifications-782x566.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p>In <strong>Google Chrome</strong>, click the icon with the three dots to the right of the address bar, scroll all the way down to Settings, Privacy and Security, Site Settings, and Notifications. Select the &#8220;Don&#8217;t allow sites to send notifications&#8221; button if you want to banish notification requests forever.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-71515" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/chromenotifications.png" alt="" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/chromenotifications.png 822w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/chromenotifications-768x512.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/chromenotifications-782x521.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p>In Apple&#8217;s <strong>Safari </strong>browser, go to Settings, Websites, and click on Notifications in the sidebar. Uncheck the option to &#8220;allow websites to ask for permission to send notifications&#8221; if you wish to turn off notification requests entirely.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Microsoft</strong> today released security updates to fix at least 67 vulnerabilities in its <strong>Windows</strong> operating systems and software. Redmond warns that one of the flaws is already under active attack, and that software blueprints showing how to exploit a pervasive Windows bug patched this month are now public.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-56287" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/windupate.png" alt="" width="749" height="527" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/windupate.png 841w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/windupate-768x541.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/windupate-782x550.png 782w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/windupate-100x70.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" /></p>
<p>The sole zero-day flaw this month is <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-33053" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2025-33053</a>, a remote code execution flaw in the Windows implementation of <strong>WebDAV</strong> &#8212; an HTTP extension that lets users remotely manage files and directories on a server. While WebDAV isn&#8217;t enabled by default in Windows, its presence in legacy or specialized systems still makes it a relevant target, said <strong>Seth Hoyt</strong>, senior security engineer at <strong>Automox</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Barnett</strong>, lead software engineer at <strong>Rapid7</strong>, said Microsoft&#8217;s advisory for CVE-2025-33053 does not mention that the Windows implementation of WebDAV is listed as deprecated since November 2023, which in practical terms means that the WebClient service no longer starts by default.</p>
<p>&#8220;The advisory also has attack complexity as low, which means that exploitation does not require preparation of the target environment in any way that is beyond the attackerâs control,&#8221; Barnett said. &#8220;Exploitation relies on the user clicking a malicious link. Itâs not clear how an asset would be immediately vulnerable if the service isnât running, but all versions of Windows receive a patch, including those released since the deprecation of WebClient, like Server 2025 and Windows 11 24H2.&#8221;<span id="more-71465"></span></p>
<p>Microsoft warns that an &#8220;elevation of privilege&#8221; vulnerability in the <strong>Windows Server Message Block</strong> (SMB) client (<a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-33073" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2025-33073</a>) is likely to be exploited, given that proof-of-concept code for this bug is now public. CVE-2025-33073 has a CVSS risk score of 8.8 (out of 10), and exploitation of the flaw leads to the attacker gaining &#8220;SYSTEM&#8221; level control over a vulnerable PC.</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes this especially dangerous is that no further user interaction is required after the initial connectionâsomething attackers can often trigger without the user realizing it,&#8221; said <strong>Alex Vovk</strong>, co-founder and CEO of <strong>Action1</strong>. &#8220;Given the high privilege level and ease of exploitation, this flaw poses a significant risk to Windows environments. The scope of affected systems is extensive, as SMB is a core Windows protocol used for file and printer sharing and inter-process communication.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beyond these highlights, 10 of the vulnerabilities fixed this month were rated &#8220;critical&#8221; by Microsoft, including eight remote code execution flaws.</p>
<p>Notably absent from this month&#8217;s patch batch is a fix for a newly discovered weakness in <strong>Windows Server 2025</strong> that allows attackers to act with the privileges of any user in Active Directory. The bug, dubbed &#8220;<strong>BadSuccessor</strong>,&#8221; was <a href="https://github.com/akamai/BadSuccessor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publicly disclosed</a> by researchers at <strong>Akamai</strong> on May 21, and several public proof-of-concepts are now available. Tenable&#8217;s Satnam Narang said organizations that have at least one Windows Server 2025 domain controller should review permissions for principals and limit those permissions as much as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Adobe</strong> has released updates for <strong>Acrobat Reader</strong> and six other products addressing at least 259 vulnerabilities, most of them in an update for <strong>Experience Manager</strong>. <strong>Mozilla Firefox</strong> and <strong>Google Chrome</strong> both recently released security updates that require a restart of the browser to take effect. The latest Chrome update fixes two zero-day exploits in the browser (CVE-2025-5419 and CVE-2025-4664).</p>

Action 1 has <a href="https://www.action1.com/patch-tuesday/patch-tuesday-june-2025/?vyj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a breakdown of patches from Microsoft</a> and a raft of other software vendors releasing fixes this month.

<p>Ukraine has seen nearly one-fifth of its Internet space come under Russian control or sold to Internet address brokers since February 2022, a new study finds. The analysis indicates large chunks of Ukrainian Internet address space are now in the hands of shadowy proxy and anonymity services that are nested at some of America&#8217;s largest Internet service providers (ISPs).</p>
<p>The findings come in <a href="https://www.kentik.com/blog/exodus-of-ipv4-from-war-torn-ukraine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a report</a> examining how the Russian invasion has affected Ukraine&#8217;s domestic supply of <strong>Internet Protocol Version 4</strong> (IPv4) addresses. Researchers at <strong>Kentik</strong>, a company that measures the performance of Internet networks, found that while a majority of ISPs in Ukraine haven&#8217;t changed their infrastructure much since the war began in 2022, others have resorted to selling swathes of their valuable IPv4 address space just to keep the lights on.</p>
<p>For example, Ukraine&#8217;s incumbent ISP <strong>Ukrtelecom</strong> is now routing just 29 percent of the IPv4 address ranges that the company controlled at the start of the war, Kentik found. Although much of that former IP space remains dormant, Ukrtelecom told Kentik&#8217;s <strong>Doug Madory</strong> they were forced to sell many of their address blocks &#8220;to secure financial stability and continue delivering essential services.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Leasing out a portion of our IPv4 resources allowed us to mitigate some of the extraordinary challenges we have been facing since the full-scale invasion began,&#8221; Ukrtelecom told Madory.</p>
<p>Madory found much of the IPv4 space previously allocated to Ukrtelecom is now scattered to more than 100 providers globally, particularly at three large American ISPs &#8212; <strong>Amazon</strong> (AS16509), <strong>AT&amp;T</strong> (AS7018), and <strong>Cogent</strong> (AS174).</p>
<p>Another Ukrainian Internet provider &#8212; <strong>LVS</strong> (AS43310) &#8212; in 2022 was routing approximately 6,000 IPv4 addresses across the nation. Kentik learned that by November 2022, much of that address space had been parceled out to over a dozen different locations, with the bulk of it being announced at AT&amp;T.</p>
<div id="attachment_71448" style="width: 755px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71448" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-71448" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kentik-lvs.png" alt="" width="745" height="505" /><p id="caption-attachment-71448" class="wp-caption-text">IP addresses routed over time by Ukrainian provider LVS (AS43310) shows a large chunk of it being routed by AT&amp;T (AS7018). Image: Kentik.</p></div>
<p>Ditto for the Ukrainian ISP <strong>TVCOM</strong>, which currently routes nearly 15,000 fewer IPv4 addresses than it did at the start of the war. Madory said most of those addresses have been scattered to 37 other networks outside of Eastern Europe, including Amazon, AT&amp;T, and <strong>Microsoft</strong>.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian ISP <strong>Trinity</strong> (AS43554) went offline in early March 2022 during the bloody siege of Mariupol, but its address space eventually began showing up in more than 50 different networks worldwide. Madory found more than 1,000 of Trinity&#8217;s IPv4 addresses suddenly appeared on AT&amp;T&#8217;s network.</p>
<p>Why are all these former Ukrainian IP addresses being routed by U.S.-based networks like AT&amp;T? According to <strong>spur.us</strong>, a company that tracks VPN and proxy services, nearly all of the address ranges identified by Kentik now map to commercial proxy services that allow customers to anonymously route their Internet traffic through someone else&#8217;s computer.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-31323" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/proxy.png" alt="" width="748" height="313" /></p>
<p>From a websiteâs perspective, the traffic from a proxy network user appears to originate from the rented IP address, not from the proxy service customer. These services can be used for several business purposes, such as price comparisons, sales intelligence, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7326663504701140992/?actorCompanyId=51677041" target="_blank" rel="noopener">web crawlers and content-scraping bots</a>. However, proxy services also are <a href="https://intel471.com/blog/a-look-at-the-residential-proxy-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">massively abused for hiding cybercrime activity</a> because they can make it difficult to trace malicious traffic to its original source.</p>
<p>IPv4 address ranges are always in high demand, which means they are also quite valuable. There are now multiple companies that will pay ISPs to lease out their unwanted or unused IPv4 address space. Madory said these IPv4 brokers will pay between $100-$500 per month to lease a block of 256 IPv4 addresses, and very often the entities most willing to pay those rental rates are proxy and VPN providers.</p>
<p>A cursory review of <a href="https://bgp.he.net/AS7018#_prefixes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all Internet address blocks currently routed through AT&amp;T</a> &#8212; as seen in public records maintained by the Internet backbone provider <strong>Hurricane Electric</strong> &#8212; shows a preponderance of country flags other than the United States, including networks originating in Hungary, Lithuania, Moldova, Mauritius, Palestine, Seychelles, Slovenia, and Ukraine.</p>
<div id="attachment_71435" style="width: 759px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71435" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-71435" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/att-bg-he-net.png" alt="" width="749" height="751" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/att-bg-he-net.png 924w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/att-bg-he-net-768x770.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/att-bg-he-net-782x785.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" /><p id="caption-attachment-71435" class="wp-caption-text">AT&amp;T&#8217;s IPv4 address space seems to be routing a great deal of proxy traffic, including a large number of IP address ranges that were until recently routed by ISPs in Ukraine.</p></div>
<p>Asked about the apparent high incidence of proxy services routing foreign address blocks through AT&amp;T, the telecommunications giant said it recently changed its policy about originating routes for network blocks that are not owned and managed by AT&amp;T. That new policy, spelled out in <a href="http://serviceguidenew.att.com/sg_flashPlayerPage/MIS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a February 2025 update to AT&amp;T&#8217;s terms of service</a>, gives those customers until Sept. 1, 2025 to originate their own IP space from their own autonomous system number (ASN), a unique number assigned to each ISP (AT&amp;T&#8217;s is AS7018).</p>
<p>âTo ensure our customers receive the best quality of service, we changed our terms for dedicated internet in February 2025,&#8221; an AT&amp;T spokesperson said in an emailed reply. &#8220;We no longer permit static routes with IP addresses that we have not provided. We have been in the process of identifying and notifying affected customers that they have 90 days to transition to Border Gateway Protocol routing using their own autonomous system number.â<span id="more-71386"></span></p>
<p>Ironically, the co-mingling of Ukrainian IP address space with proxy providers has resulted in many of these addresses being used in cyberattacks against Ukraine and other enemies of Russia. Earlier this month, the European Union sanctioned <strong>Stark Industries Solutions Inc.</strong>, an ISP that surfaced two weeks before the Russian invasion and quickly became the source of large-scale DDoS attacks and spear-phishing attempts by Russian state-sponsored hacking groups. A deep dive into Stark&#8217;s considerable address space showed some of it was sourced from Ukrainian ISPs, and <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/05/stark-industries-solutions-an-iron-hammer-in-the-cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most of it was connected to Russia-based proxy and anonymity services</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_71443" style="width: 855px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71443" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-71443" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/iproyal.png" alt="" width="845" height="462" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/iproyal.png 845w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/iproyal-768x420.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/iproyal-782x428.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 845px) 100vw, 845px" /><p id="caption-attachment-71443" class="wp-caption-text">According to Spur, the proxy service IPRoyal is the current beneficiary of IP address blocks from several Ukrainian ISPs profiled in Kentik&#8217;s report. Customers can chose proxies by specifying the city and country they would to proxy their traffic through. Image: Trend Micro.</p></div>
<p>Spur&#8217;s Chief Technology Officer <strong>Riley KilmerÂ </strong>said AT&amp;T&#8217;s policy change will likely force many proxy services to migrate to other U.S. providers that have less stringent policies.</p>
<p>&#8220;AT&amp;T is the first one of the big ISPs that seems to be actually doing something about this,&#8221; Kilmer said. &#8220;We track several services that explicitly sell AT&amp;T IP addresses, and it will be very interesting to see what happens to those services come September.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, Kilmer said, there are several other large U.S. ISPs that continue to make it easy for proxy services to bring their own IP addresses and host them in ranges that give the appearance of residential customers. For example, Kentik&#8217;s report identified former Ukrainian IP ranges showing up as proxy services routed by <strong>Cogent</strong> <strong>Communications </strong>(AS174), <a href="https://bgp.he.net/AS174#_prefixes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a tier-one Internet backbone provider</a> based in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Kilmer said Cogent has become an attractive home base for proxy services because it is relatively easy to get Cogent to route an address block.</p>
<p>&#8220;In fairness, they transit a lot of traffic,&#8221; Kilmer said of Cogent. &#8220;But there&#8217;s a reason a lot of this proxy stuff shows up as Cogent: Because it&#8217;s super easy to get something routed there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cogent declined a request to comment on Kentik&#8217;s findings.</p>

<p>The U.S. government today imposed economic sanctions on <strong>Funnull Technology Inc.</strong>, a Philippines-based company that provides computer infrastructure for hundreds of thousands of websites involved in virtual currency investment scams known as â<strong>pig butchering</strong>.&#8221; In January 2025, KrebsOnSecurity detailed how Funnull was being used as a content delivery network that catered to cybercriminals seeking to route their traffic through U.S.-based cloud providers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Americans lose billions of dollars annually to these cyber scams, with revenues generated from these crimes rising to record levels in 2024,&#8221; reads <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0149" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a statement</a> from the <strong>U.S. Department of the Treasury</strong>, which sanctioned Funnull and its 40-year-old Chinese administrator <strong>Liu Lizhi</strong>. &#8220;Funnull has directly facilitated several of these schemes, resulting in over $200 million in U.S. victim-reported losses.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Treasury Department said Funnull&#8217;s operations are linked to the majority of virtual currency investment scam websites reported to the FBI. The agency said Funnull directly facilitated pig butchering and other schemes that resulted in more than $200 million in financial losses by Americans.</p>
<p>Pig butchering is a rampant form of fraud wherein people are lured by flirtatious strangers online into investing in fraudulent cryptocurrency trading platforms. Victims are coached to invest more and more money into what appears to be an extremely profitable trading platform, only to find their money is gone when they wish to cash out.</p>
<p>The scammers often insist that investors pay additional &#8220;taxes&#8221; on their crypto &#8220;earnings&#8221; before they can see their invested funds again (spoiler: they never do), and a shocking number of people <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/07/massive-losses-define-epidemic-of-pig-butchering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have lost six figures or more through these pig butchering scams</a>.</p>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity&#8217;s <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/01/infrastructure-laundering-blending-in-with-the-cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January story on Funnull</a> was based on research from the security firm <strong>Silent Push</strong>, which discovered in October 2024 that a vast number of domains hosted via Funnull were promoting gambling sites that bore the logo of the <strong>Suncity Group</strong>, a Chinese entity named inÂ <a href="https://www.unodc.org/roseap/uploads/documents/Publications/2024/Casino_Underground_Banking_Report_2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 2024 UN report</a> (PDF) for laundering millions of dollars for the North Korean state-sponsored hacking group <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazarus_Group" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lazarus</a>.</p>
<p>Silent Push found Funnull was a criminal content delivery network (CDN) that carried a great deal of traffic tied to scam websites, funneling the traffic through a dizzying chain of auto-generated domain names and U.S.-based cloud providers before redirecting to malicious or phishous websites. The FBI has released a <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/CSA/2025/250529.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">technical writeup</a> (PDF) of the infrastructure used to manage the malicious Funnull domains between October 2023 and April 2025.</p>
<div id="attachment_71392" style="width: 759px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71392" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-71392" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/funnull-network.png" alt="" width="749" height="464" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/funnull-network.png 2556w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/funnull-network-768x476.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/funnull-network-1536x952.png 1536w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/funnull-network-2048x1269.png 2048w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/funnull-network-782x485.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" /><p id="caption-attachment-71392" class="wp-caption-text">A graphic from the FBI explaining how Funnull generated a slew of new domains on a regular basis and mapped them to Internet addresses on U.S. cloud providers.</p></div>
<p>Silent Push <a href="https://www.silentpush.com/blog/infrastructure-laundering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revisited Funnull&#8217;s infrastructure</a> in January 2025 and found Funnull was still using many of the same <strong>Amazon</strong> and <strong>Microsoft</strong> cloud Internet addresses identified as malicious in its October report. Both Amazon and Microsoft pledged to rid their networks of Funnull&#8217;s presence following that story, but according to Silent Push&#8217;s <strong>Zach Edwards</strong> only one of those companies has followed through.</p>
<p>Edwards said Silent Push no longer sees Microsoft Internet addresses showing up in Funnull&#8217;s infrastructure, while Amazon continues to struggle with removing Funnull servers, including one that appears to have first materialized in 2023.</p>
<p>&#8220;Amazon is doing a terrible job &#8212; every day since they made those claims to you and us in our public blog they have had IPs still mapped to Funnull, including some that have stayed mapped for inexplicable periods of time,&#8221; Edwards said.</p>
<p>Amazon said its Amazon Web Services (AWS) hosting platform actively counters abuse attempts.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have stopped hundreds of attempts this year related to this group and we are looking into the information you shared earlier today,&#8221; reads a statement shared by Amazon. &#8220;If anyone suspects that AWS resources are being used for abusive activity, they can report it to AWS Trust &amp; Safety using the report abuse form <a href="https://support.aws.amazon.com/#/contacts/report-abuse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p><span id="more-71387"></span></p>
<p>U.S. based cloud providers remain an attractive home base for cybercriminal organizations because many organizations will not be overly aggressive in blocking traffic from U.S.-based cloud networks, as doing so can result in blocking access to many legitimate web destinations that are also on that same shared network segment or host.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, funneling their bad traffic so that it appears to be coming out of U.S. cloud Internet providers allows cybercriminals to connect to websites from web addresses that are geographically close(r) to their targets and victims (to sidestep location-based security controls by your bank, for example).</p>
<p>Funnull is not the only cybercriminal infrastructure-as-a-service provider that was sanctioned this month: On May 20, 2025, the <strong>European Union</strong> <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:L_202500966" target="_blank" rel="noopener">imposed sanctions</a> on <strong>Stark Industries Solutions</strong>, an ISP that materialized at the start of Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine and has been used as a global proxy network that conceals the true source of cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns against enemies of Russia.</p>
<p>In May 2024, KrebsOnSecurity published <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/05/stark-industries-solutions-an-iron-hammer-in-the-cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a deep dive on Stark Industries Solutions</a> that found much of the malicious traffic traversing Starkâs network (e.g. vulnerability scanning and password brute force attacks) was being bounced through U.S.-based cloud providers. My reporting showed how deeply Stark had penetrated U.S. ISPs, and that its co-founder for many years sold &#8220;bulletproof&#8221; hosting services that told Russian cybercrime forum customers they would proudly ignore any abuse complaints or police inquiries.</p>
<div id="attachment_67471" style="width: 758px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-67471" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-67471" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/stark-industries-solutions.png" alt="" width="748" height="464" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/stark-industries-solutions.png 1197w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/stark-industries-solutions-768x477.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/stark-industries-solutions-782x485.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px" /><p id="caption-attachment-67471" class="wp-caption-text">The homepage of Stark Industries Solutions.</p></div>
<p>That story examined the history of Stark&#8217;s co-founders, Moldovan brothers <strong>Ivan</strong> and <strong>Yuri Neculiti</strong>, who each denied past involvement in cybercrime or any current involvement in assisting Russian disinformation efforts or cyberattacks. Nevertheless, the EU sanctioned both brothers as well.</p>
<p>The EU said Stark and the Neculti brothers &#8220;enabled various Russian state-sponsored and state-affiliated actors to conduct destabilising activities including coordinated information manipulation and interference and cyber-attacks against the Union and third countries by providing services intended to hide these activities from European law enforcement and security agencies.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Authorities in Pakistan have arrested 21 individuals accused of operating &#8220;<strong>Heartsender</strong>,&#8221; a once popular spam and malware dissemination service that operated for more than a decade. The main clientele for HeartSender were organized crime groups that tried to trick victim companies into making payments to a third party, and its alleged proprietors were publicly identified by KrebsOnSecurity in 2021 after they inadvertently infected their computers with malware.</p>
<div id="attachment_56867" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-56867" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-56867" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/fudcoteam.png" alt="" width="750" height="351" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/fudcoteam.png 1694w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/fudcoteam-768x359.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/fudcoteam-1536x718.png 1536w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/fudcoteam-782x366.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><p id="caption-attachment-56867" class="wp-caption-text">Some of the core developers and sellers of Heartsender posing at a work outing in 2021. WeCodeSolutions boss Rameez Shahzad (in sunglasses) is in the center of this group photo, which was posted by employee Burhan Ul Haq, pictured just to the right of Shahzad.</p></div>
<p>A <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1911691" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> from the Pakistani media outlet <strong>Dawn</strong> states that authorities there arrested 21 people alleged to have operated Heartsender, a spam delivery service whose homepage openly advertised phishing kits targeting users of various Internet companies, including Microsoft 365, Yahoo, AOL, Intuit, iCloud and ID.me. Pakistan&#8217;s <strong>National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency</strong> (NCCIA) reportedly conducted raids in Lahore&#8217;s Bahria Town and Multan on May 15 and 16.</p>
<p>The NCCIA told reporters the groupâs tools were connected to more than $50m in losses in the United States alone, with European authorities investigating 63 additional cases.</p>
<p>âThis wasnât just a scam operation &#8211; it was essentially a cybercrime university that empowered fraudsters globally,â <strong>NCCIA Director Abdul Ghaffar</strong> said at a press briefing.</p>
<p>In January 2025, the FBI and the Dutch Police <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/01/fbi-dutch-police-disrupt-manipulaters-phishing-gang/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seized the technical infrastructure</a> for the cybercrime service, which was marketed under the brands Heartsender, <strong>Fudpage</strong> and <strong>Fudtools</strong> (and many other âfudâ variations). The âfudâ bit stands for âFully Un-Detectable,â and it refers to cybercrime resources that will evade detection by security tools like antivirus software or anti-spam appliances.</p>
<p>The FBI says transnational organized crime groups that purchased these services primarily used them to run business email compromise (BEC) schemes, wherein the cybercrime actors tricked victim companies into making payments to a third party.</p>
<p>Dawn reported that those arrested included <strong>Rameez Shahzad</strong>, the alleged ringleader of the Heartsender cybercrime business, which most recently operated under the Pakistani front company <strong>WeCodeSolutions</strong>. Mr. Shahzad was named and pictured in a 2021 KrebsOnSecurity story about <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/09/fudco-spam-empire-tied-to-pakistani-software-firm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a series of remarkable operational security mistakes</a> that exposed their identities and Facebook pages showing employees posing for group photos and socializing at work-related outings.<span id="more-71337"></span></p>
<p>Prior to folding their operations behind WeCodeSolutions, Shahzad and others arrested this month operated as a web hosting group calling itself <strong>The Manipulaters</strong>. KrebsOnSecurity <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/05/phishing-gang-is-audacious-manipulator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first wrote about The Manipulaters in May 2015</a>, mainly because their ads at the time were blanketing a number of popular cybercrime forums, and because they were fairly open and brazen about what they were doing â even who they were in real life.</p>
<p>Sometime in 2019, The Manipulaters <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/09/fudco-spam-empire-tied-to-pakistani-software-firm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">failed to renew their core domain name</a> â manipulaters[.]com â the same one tied to so many of the companyâs business operations. That domain was quickly scooped up byÂ <a href="https://www.scyllaintel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scylla Intel</a>, a cyber intelligence firm that specializes in connecting cybercriminals to their real-life identities. Soon after, Scylla started receiving large amounts of email correspondence intended for the group&#8217;s owners.</p>
<p>In 2024, <strong>DomainTools.com</strong> <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/04/the-manipulaters-improve-phishing-still-fail-at-opsec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> the web-hosted version of Heartsender leaked an extraordinary amount of user information to unauthenticated users, including customer credentials and email records from Heartsender employees. DomainTools says the malware infections on Manipulaters PCs exposed âvast swaths of account-related data along with an outline of the groupâs membership, operations, and position in the broader underground economy.â</p>
<p>Shahzad allegedly used the alias &#8220;<strong>Saim Raza</strong>,&#8221; an identity which has contacted KrebsOnSecurity multiple times over the past decade with demands to remove stories published about the group. The Saim Raza identity most recently contacted this author in November 2024, asserting they had quit the cybercrime industry and turned over a new leaf after a brush with the Pakistani police.</p>
<p>The arrested suspects include Rameez Shahzad, Muhammad Aslam (Rameezâs father), Atif Hussain, Muhammad Umar Irshad, Yasir Ali, Syed Saim Ali Shah, Muhammad Nowsherwan, Burhanul Haq, Adnan Munawar, Abdul Moiz, Hussnain Haider, Bilal Ahmad, Dilbar Hussain, Muhammad Adeel Akram, Awais Rasool, Usama Farooq, Usama Mehmood and Hamad Nawaz.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. government today unsealed criminal charges against 16 individuals accused of operating and selling <strong>DanaBot</strong>, a prolific strain of information-stealing malware that has been sold on Russian cybercrime forums since 2018. The <strong>FBI</strong> says a newer version of DanaBot was used for espionage, and that many of the defendants exposed their real-life identities after accidentally infecting their own systems with the malware.</p>
<div id="attachment_71354" style="width: 759px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71354" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-71354" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/danabot.png" alt="" width="749" height="650" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/danabot.png 817w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/danabot-768x666.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/danabot-782x679.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" /><p id="caption-attachment-71354" class="wp-caption-text">DanaBot&#8217;s features, as promoted on its support site. Image: welivesecurity.com.</p></div>
<p>Initially <a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/danabot-new-banking-trojan-surfaces-down-under-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> in May 2018 by researchers at the email security firm <strong>Proofpoint</strong>, DanaBot is a malware-as-a-service platform that specializes in credential theft and banking fraud.</p>
<p>Today, the <strong>U.S. Department of Justice</strong> unsealed a criminal complaint and indictment from 2022, which said the FBI identified at least 40 affiliates who were paying between $3,000 and $4,000 a month for access to the information stealer platform.</p>
<p>The government says the malware infected more than 300,000 systems globally, causing estimated losses of more than $50 million. The ringleaders of the DanaBot conspiracy are named as <strong>Aleksandr Stepanov</strong>, 39, a.k.a. â<strong>JimmBee</strong>,â and <strong>Artem Aleksandrovich Kalinkin</strong>, 34, a.k.a. â<strong>Onix</strong>â, both of Novosibirsk, Russia. Kalinkin is an IT engineer for the Russian state-owned energy giant <strong>Gazprom</strong>. His Facebook profile name is &#8220;Maffiozi.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the FBI, there were at least two major versions of DanaBot; the first was sold between 2018 and June 2020, when the malware stopped being offered on Russian cybercrime forums. The government alleges that the second version of DanaBot &#8212; emerging in January 2021 &#8212; was provided to co-conspirators for use in targeting military, diplomatic and non-governmental organization computers in several countries, including the United States, Belarus, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Russia.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unindicted co-conspirators would use the Espionage Variant to compromise computers around the world and steal sensitive diplomatic communications, credentials, and other data from these targeted victims,&#8221; reads a grand jury indictment dated Sept. 20, 2022. &#8220;This stolen data included financial transactions by diplomatic staff, correspondence concerning day-to-day diplomatic activity, as well as summaries of a particular country&#8217;s interactions with the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p>The indictment says the FBI in 2022 seized servers used by the DanaBot authors to control their malware, as well as the servers that stored stolen victim data. The government said the server data also show numerous instances in which the DanaBot defendants infected their own PCs, resulting in their credential data being uploaded to stolen data repositories that were seized by the feds.</p>
<p>&#8220;In some cases, such self-infections appeared to be deliberately done in order to test, analyze, or improve the malware,&#8221; the criminal complaint reads. &#8220;In other cases, the infections seemed to be inadvertent &#8211; one of the hazards of committing cybercrime is that criminals will sometimes infect themselves with their own malware by mistake.&#8221;<span id="more-71351"></span></p>
<div id="attachment_71359" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71359" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-71359" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/eset-danabotmap.png" alt="" width="750" height="479" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/eset-danabotmap.png 846w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/eset-danabotmap-768x490.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/eset-danabotmap-782x499.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><p id="caption-attachment-71359" class="wp-caption-text">Image: welivesecurity.com</p></div>
<p>A <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/16-defendants-federally-charged-connection-danabot-malware-scheme-infected-computers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a> from the DOJ says that as part of today&#8217;s operation, agents with the <strong>Defense Criminal Investigative Service</strong> (DCIS) seized the DanaBot control servers, including dozens of virtual servers hosted in the United States. The government says it is now working with industry partners to notify DanaBot victims and help remediate infections. The statement credits a number of security firms with providing assistance to the government, including <strong>ESET</strong>, <strong>Flashpoint</strong>, <strong>Google</strong>, <strong>Intel 471</strong>, <strong>Lumen</strong>, <strong>PayPal</strong>, <strong>Proofpoint</strong>, <strong>Team CYMRU</strong>, and <strong>ZScaler</strong>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not unheard of for financially-oriented malicious software to be repurposed for espionage. A variant of the <strong>ZeuS Trojan</strong>, which was used in countless online banking attacks against companies in the United States and Europe between 2007 and at least 2015, was for a time diverted to espionage tasks by its author.</p>
<p>As detailed <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/08/inside-the-100m-business-club-crime-gang/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in this 2015 story,</a> the author of the ZeuS trojan created a custom version of the malware to serve purely as a spying machine, which scoured infected systems in Ukraine for specific keywords in emails and documents that would likely only be found in classified documents.</p>
<p>The public charging of the 16 DanaBot defendants comes a day after <strong>Microsoft</strong> <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/05/21/lumma-stealer-breaking-down-the-delivery-techniques-and-capabilities-of-a-prolific-infostealer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joined</a> a slew of tech companies in <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-seizes-domains-behind-major-information-stealing-malware-operation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disrupting the IT infrastructure</a> for another malware-as-a-service offering &#8212; <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/eset-takes-part-global-operation-disrupt-lumma-stealer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lumma Stealer</a>, which is likewise offered to affiliates under tiered subscription prices ranging from $250 to $1,000 per month. Separately, Microsoft filed a civil lawsuit to seize control over 2,300 domain names used by Lumma Stealer and its affiliates.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>KrebsOnSecurity last week was hit by a near record distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack that clocked in at more than 6.3 terabits of data per second (a terabit is one trillion bits of data). The brief attack appears to have been a test run for a massive new Internet of Things (IoT) botnet capable of launching crippling digital assaults that few web destinations can withstand. Read on for more about the botnet, the attack, and the apparent creator of this global menace.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-71312" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ddosbomb.png" alt="" width="661" height="542" /></p>
<p>For reference, the 6.3 Tbps attack last week was ten times the size of the assault launched against this site in 2016 by the <strong>Mirai</strong> IoT botnet, which <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/the-democratization-of-censorship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">held KrebsOnSecurity offline for nearly four days</a>. The 2016 assault was so large that <strong>Akamai</strong> &#8211; which was providing pro-bono DDoS protection for KrebsOnSecurity at the time &#8212; asked me to leave their service because the attack was causing problems for their paying customers.</p>
<p>Since the Mirai attack, KrebsOnSecurity.com has been behind the protection of <strong>Project Shield</strong>, a free DDoS defense service that <strong>Google</strong>Â provides to websites offering news, human rights, and election-related content. Google Security Engineer <strong>Damian Menscher</strong> told KrebsOnSecurity the May 12 attack was the largest Google has ever handled. In terms of sheer size, it is second only to a very similar attack that <strong>Cloudflare</strong> mitigated and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/ddos-threat-report-for-2025-q1/#hyper-volumetric-attacks-continue-spill-into-q2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote about in April</a>.</p>
<p>After comparing notes with Cloudflare, Menscher said the botnet that launched both attacks bears the fingerprints of <strong>Aisuru</strong>, a digital siege machine that first surfaced less than a year ago. Menscher said the attack on KrebsOnSecurity lasted less than a minute, hurling <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-best-practices-ddos-resiliency/udp-reflection-attacks.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large UDP data packets</a> at random ports <em>at a rate of approximately 585 million data packets per second</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was the type of attack normally designed to overwhelm network links,&#8221; Menscher said, referring to the throughput connections between and among various Internet service providers (ISPs). &#8220;For most companies, this size of attack would kill them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Aisuru botnet comprises a globally-dispersed collection of hacked IoT devices, including routers, digital video recorders and other systems that are commandeered via default passwords or software vulnerabilities. As <a href="https://blog.xlab.qianxin.com/large-scale-botnet-airashi-en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documented</a> by researchers at <strong>QiAnXin XLab</strong>, the botnet was first identified in an August 2024 attack on a large gaming platform.</p>
<p>Aisuru reportedly went quiet after that exposure, only to reappear in November with even more firepower and software exploits. In a <a href="https://blog.xlab.qianxin.com/large-scale-botnet-airashi-en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January 2025 report</a>, XLab found the new and improved Aisuru (a.k.a. &#8220;<strong>Airashi</strong>&#8220;) had incorporated a previously unknown zero-day vulnerability in Cambium Networks cnPilot routers.</p>
<h2>NOT FORKING AROUND</h2>
<p>The people behind the Aisuru botnet have been peddling access to their DDoS machine in public <strong>Telegram</strong> chat channels that are closely monitored by multiple security firms. In August 2024, the botnet was rented out in subscription tiers ranging from $150 per day to $600 per week, offering attacks of up to two terabits per second.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may not attack any measurement walls, healthcare facilities, schools or government sites,&#8221; read a notice posted on Telegram by the Aisuru botnet owners in August 2024.</p>
<p>Interested parties were told to contact the Telegram handle &#8220;<strong>@yfork</strong>&#8221; to purchase a subscription. The account @yfork previously used the nickname &#8220;<strong>Forky</strong>,&#8221; an identity that has been posting to public DDoS-focused Telegram channels since 2021.</p>
<p>According to the FBI, Forky&#8217;s DDoS-for-hire domains have been seized in multiple law enforcement operations over the years. Last year, Forky said on Telegram he was selling the domain <strong>stresser[.]best</strong>, which saw its servers seized by the FBI in 2022 as part of an ongoing international law enforcement effort aimed at diminishing the supply of and demand for DDoS-for-hire services.<span id="more-71303"></span></p>
<p>&#8220;The operator of this service, who calls himself &#8216;Forky,&#8217; operates a Telegram channel to advertise features and communicate with current and prospective DDoS customers,&#8221; reads <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Booter-seizure-warrant-Tucows-2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an FBI seizure warrant</a> (PDF) issued for stresser[.]best. The FBI warrant stated that on the same day the seizures were announced, Forky posted <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/12/six-charged-in-mass-takedown-of-ddos-for-hire-sites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a link to a story on this blog</a> that detailed the domain seizure operation, adding the comment, âWe are buying our new domains right now.â</p>
<div id="attachment_71315" style="width: 758px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71315" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-71315" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/stresserbest.png" alt="" width="748" height="663" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/stresserbest.png 953w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/stresserbest-768x681.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/stresserbest-782x693.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px" /><p id="caption-attachment-71315" class="wp-caption-text">A screenshot from the FBI&#8217;s seizure warrant for Forky&#8217;s DDoS-for-hire domains shows Forky announcing the resurrection of their service at new domains.</p></div>
<p>Approximately ten hours later, Forky posted again, including a screenshot of the stresser[.]best user dashboard, instructing customers to use their saved passwords for the old website on the new one.</p>
<p>A review of Forky&#8217;s posts to public Telegram channels &#8212; as indexed by the cyber intelligence firms <strong>Unit 221B</strong> and <strong>Flashpoint</strong> &#8212; reveals a 21-year-old individual who claims to reside in Brazil [full disclosure: Flashpoint is currently an advertiser on this blog].</p>
<p>Since late 2022, Forky&#8217;s posts have frequently promoted a DDoS mitigation company and ISP that he operates called <strong>botshield[.]io</strong>. The Botshield website is connected to a business entity registered in the United Kingdom called <a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/officers/krPZ3H9McgoRJbksmVWst3yc9G0/appointments" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Botshield LTD</a>, which lists a 21-year-old woman from Sao Paulo, Brazil as the director. Internet routing records indicate Botshield (<a href="https://ipinfo.io/AS213613" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AS213613</a>) currently controls several hundred Internet addresses that were allocated to the company earlier this year.</p>
<p><strong>Domaintools.com</strong> reports that botshield[.]io was registered in July 2022 to a <strong>Kaike Southier Leite</strong> in Sao Paulo. A <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaike-southier-5074b82b6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn profile</a> by the same name says this individual is a network specialist from Brazil who works in &#8220;the planning and implementation of robust network infrastructures, with a focus on security, DDoS mitigation, colocation and cloud server services.&#8221;</p>
<h2>MEET FORKY</h2>
<div id="attachment_71314" style="width: 789px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71314" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-71314 size-full" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/forky.png" alt="" width="779" height="519" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/forky.png 779w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/forky-768x512.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 779px) 100vw, 779px" /><p id="caption-attachment-71314" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Jaclyn Vernace / Shutterstock.com.</p></div>
<p>In his posts to public Telegram chat channels, Forky has hardly attempted to conceal his whereabouts or identity. In countless chat conversations indexed by Unit 221B, Forky could be seen talking about everyday life in Brazil, often remarking on the extremely low or high prices in Brazil for a range of goods, from computer and networking gear to narcotics and food.</p>
<p>Reached via Telegram, Forky claimed he was &#8220;not involved in this type of illegal actions for years now,&#8221; and that the project had been taken over by other unspecified developers. Forky initially told KrebsOnSecurity he had been out of the botnet scene for years, only to concede this wasn&#8217;t true when presented with public posts on Telegram from late last year that clearly showed otherwise.</p>
<p>Forky denied being involved in the attack on KrebsOnSecurity, but acknowledged that he helped to develop and market the Aisuru botnet. Forky claims he is now merely a staff member for the Aisuru botnet team, and that he stopped running the botnet roughly two months ago after starting a family. Forky also said the woman named as director of Botshield is related to him.</p>
<p>Forky offered equivocal, evasive responses to a number of questions about the Aisuru botnet and his business endeavors. But on one point he was crystal clear:</p>
<p>&#8220;I have zero fear about you, the FBI, or Interpol,&#8221; Forky said, asserting that he is now almost entirely focused on their hosting business &#8212; Botshield.</p>
<p>Forky declined to discuss the makeup of his ISP&#8217;s clientele, or to clarify whether Botshield was more of a hosting provider or a DDoS mitigation firm. However, Forky has posted on Telegram about Botshield successfully mitigating large DDoS attacks launched against other DDoS-for-hire services.</p>
<p>DomainTools finds the same Sao Paulo street address in the registration records for botshield[.]io was used to register several other domains, including <strong>cant-mitigate[.]us.</strong> The email address in the WHOIS records for that domain is forkcontato@gmail.com, which DomainTools says was used to register the domain for the now-defunct DDoS-for-hire service <strong>stresser[.]us</strong>, one of the domains seized in <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/05/feds-take-down-13-more-ddos-for-hire-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the FBI&#8217;s 2023 crackdown</a>.</p>
<p>On May 8, 2023, the <strong>U.S. Department of Justice</strong> <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/federal-authorities-seize-13-internet-domains-associated-booter-websites-offered-ddos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the seizure of stresser[.]us, along with a dozen other domains offering DDoS services. The DOJ said ten of the 13 domains were reincarnations of services that were seized during a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/federal-prosecutors-los-angeles-and-alaska-charge-6-defendants-operating-websites" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/federal-prosecutors-los-angeles-and-alaska-charge-6-defendants-operating-websites&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1747842233209000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0Tl0oBqaLrBCwcoLIjUEED">prior sweep in December</a>, which targeted 48 top stresser services (also known as &#8220;booters&#8221;).</p>
<p>Forky claimed he could find out who attacked my site with Aisuru. But when pressed a day later on the question, Forky said he&#8217;d come up empty-handed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tried to ask around, all the big guys are not retarded enough to attack you,&#8221; Forky explained in an interview on Telegram. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t have anything to do with it. But you are welcome to write the story and try to put the blame on me.&#8221;</p>
<h2>THE GHOST OF MIRAI</h2>
<p>The 6.3 Tbps attack last week caused no visible disruption to this site, in part because it was so brief &#8212; lasting approximately 45 seconds. DDoS attacks of such magnitude and brevity typically are produced when botnet operators wish to test or demonstrate their firepower for the benefit of potential buyers. Indeed, Google&#8217;s Menscher said it is likely that both the May 12 attack and the slightly larger 6.5 Tbps attack against Cloudflare last month were simply tests of the same botnet&#8217;s capabilities.</p>
<p>In many ways, the threat posed by the Aisuru/Airashi botnet is reminiscent of Mirai, an innovative IoT malware strain that emerged in the summer of 2016 and successfully out-competed virtually all other IoT malware strains in existence at the time.</p>
<p>As first revealed by KrebsOnSecurity in January 2017, the Mirai authors were <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/01/who-is-anna-senpai-the-mirai-worm-author/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two U.S. men who co-ran a DDoS mitigation service</a> &#8212; even as they were selling far more lucrative DDoS-for-hire services using the most powerful botnet on the planet.</p>
<p>Less than a week after the Mirai botnet was used in a days-long DDoS against KrebsOnSecurity, the Mirai authors <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/source-code-for-iot-botnet-mirai-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published the source code to their botnet</a> so that they would not be the only ones in possession of it in the event of their arrest by federal investigators.</p>
<p>Ironically, the leaking of the Mirai source is precisely what led to the eventual unmasking and arrest of the Mirai authors, who went on to serve probation sentences that <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mirai-untold-story-three-young-hackers-web-killing-monster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">required them to consult with FBI investigators on DDoS investigations</a>. But that leak also rapidly led to the creation of dozens of Mirai botnet clones, many of which were harnessed to fuel their own powerful DDoS-for-hire services.</p>
<p>Menscher told KrebsOnSecurity that as counterintuitive as it may sound, the Internet as a whole would probably be better off if the source code for Aisuru became public knowledge. After all, he said, the people behind Aisuru are in constant competition with other IoT botnet operators who are all striving to commandeer a finite number of vulnerable IoT devices globally.</p>
<p>Such a development would almost certainly cause a proliferation of Aisuru botnet clones, he said, but at least then the overall firepower from each individual botnet would be greatly diminished &#8212; or at least within range of the mitigation capabilities of most DDoS protection providers.</p>
<p>Barring a source code leak, Menscher said, it would be nice if someone published the full list of software exploits being used by the Aisuru operators to grow their botnet so quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Part of the reason Mirai was so dangerous was that it effectively took out competing botnets,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This attack somehow managed to compromise all these boxes that nobody else knows about. Ideally, we&#8217;d want to see that fragmented out, so that no [individual botnet operator] controls too much.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In what experts are calling a novel legal outcome, the 22-year-old former administrator of the cybercrime community <strong>Breachforums </strong>will forfeit nearly $700,000 to settle a civil lawsuit from a health insurance company whose customer data was posted for sale on the forum in 2023. <strong>Conor Brian Fitzpatrick</strong>, a.k.a. &#8220;<strong>Pompompurin</strong>,&#8221; is slated for resentencing next month after pleading guilty to access device fraud and possession of child sexual abuse material (CSAM).</p>
<div id="attachment_71274" style="width: 985px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71274" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-71274" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/breached-nonstop.png" alt="" width="975" height="364" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/breached-nonstop.png 975w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/breached-nonstop-768x287.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/breached-nonstop-782x292.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" /><p id="caption-attachment-71274" class="wp-caption-text">A redacted screenshot of the Breachforums sales thread. Image: Ke-la.com.</p></div>
<p>On January 18, 2023, denizens of Breachforums posted for sale tens of thousands of records &#8212; including Social Security numbers, dates of birth, addresses, and phone numbersÂ  &#8212; stolen from <strong>Nonstop Health</strong>, an insurance provider based in Concord, Calif.</p>
<p>Class-action attorneys sued Nonstop Health, which added Fitzpatrick as a third-party defendant to the civil litigation in November 2023, several months after he was <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/03/feds-charge-ny-man-as-breachforums-boss-pompompurin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arrested by the FBI</a> and criminally charged with access device fraud and CSAM possession. In January 2025, Nonstop <a href="https://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/closed-settlements/1-6m-nonstop-administration-and-insurance-services-data-breach-class-action-settlement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agreed to pay $1.5 million</a> to settle the class action.</p>
<p><strong>Jill Fertel</strong> is a former prosecutor who runs the cyber litigation practice at <strong>Cipriani &amp; Werner</strong>, the law firm that represented Nonstop Health. Fertel told KrebsOnSecurity this is the first and only case where a cybercriminal or anyone related to the security incident was actually named in civil litigation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Civil plaintiffs are not at all likely to see money seized from threat actors involved in the incident to be made available to people impacted by the breach,&#8221; Fertel said. &#8220;The best we could do was make this money available to the class, but it&#8217;s still incumbent on the members of the class who are impacted to make that claim.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Mark Rasch</strong> is a former federal prosecutor who now represents <strong>Unit 221B</strong>, a cybersecurity firm based in New York City. Rasch said he doesn&#8217;t doubt that the civil settlement involving Fitzpatrick&#8217;s criminal activity is a novel legal development.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is rare in these civil cases that you know the threat actor involved in the breach, and it&#8217;s also rare that you catch them with sufficient resources to be able to pay a claim,&#8221; Rasch said.</p>
<p>Despite admitting to possessing more than 600 CSAM images and personally operating Breachforums, Fitzpatrick was <a href="https://cyberscoop.com/jailed-breachforums-creator-admin-sentenced-to-20-years-of-supervised-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sentenced in January 2024 to time served</a> and 20 years of supervised release. Federal prosecutors objected, arguing that his punishment failed to adequately reflect the seriousness of his crimes or serve as a deterrent.</p>
<div id="attachment_71269" style="width: 759px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71269" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-71269" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/pom-csam.png" alt="" width="749" height="299" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/pom-csam.png 789w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/pom-csam-768x307.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/pom-csam-782x312.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px" /><p id="caption-attachment-71269" class="wp-caption-text">An excerpt from a pre-sentencing report for Fitzpatrick indicates he had more than 600 CSAM images on his devices.</p></div>
<p>Indeed, the same month he was sentenced Fitzpatrick <a href="https://dd80b675424c132b90b3-e48385e382d2e5d17821a5e1d8e4c86b.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/external/sdny-24mj003-waiver-jan22024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was rearrested</a> (PDF) for violating the terms of his release, which forbade him from using a computer that didn&#8217;t have court-required monitoring software installed.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors said Fitzpatrick went on Discord following his guilty plea and <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca4/24-4102/24-4102-2025-01-21.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">professed innocence</a> to the very crimes to which he&#8217;d pleaded guilty, stating that his plea deal was &#8220;so BS&#8221; and that he had &#8220;wanted to fight it.&#8221; The feds said Fitzpatrick also joked with his friends about selling data to foreign governments, exhorting one user to &#8220;become a foreign asset to china or russia,&#8221; and to &#8220;sell government secrets.&#8221;<span id="more-71263"></span></p>
<p>In January 2025, a federal appeals court agreed with the government&#8217;s assessment, <a href="https://cyberscoop.com/conor-fitzpatrick-resentenced-pompompurin-breachforums/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vacating Fitzpatrick&#8217;s sentence</a> and ordering him to be resentenced on June 3, 2025.</p>
<p>Fitzpatrick launched BreachForums in March 2022 to replace <strong>RaidForums</strong>, a similarly popular crime forum that was <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/04/raidforums-get-raided-alleged-admin-arrested/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infiltrated and shut down by the FBI</a> the previous month. As administrator, his alter ego Pompompurin served as the middleman, personally reviewing all databases for sale on the forum and offering an escrow service to those interested in buying stolen data.</p>
<div id="attachment_71270" style="width: 375px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71270" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-71270" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/conorfitzpatrick-yearbook.png" alt="" width="365" height="560" /><p id="caption-attachment-71270" class="wp-caption-text">A yearbook photo of Fitzpatrick unearthed by the Yonkers Times.</p></div>
<p>The new site quickly attracted more than 300,000 users, and facilitated the sale of databases stolen from hundreds of hacking victims, including some of the largest consumer data breaches in recent history. In May 2024, a reincarnation of Breachforums was seized by the FBI and international partners. Still more relaunches of the forum occurred after that, with <a href="https://socradar.io/breachforums-is-offline-a-new-twist-or-just-another-cyber-sheningan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the most recent disruption</a> last month.</p>
<p>As KrebsOnSecurity reported last year in <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/09/the-dark-nexus-between-harm-groups-and-the-com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Dark Nexus Between Harm Groups and The Com</a>, it is increasingly common for federal investigators to find CSAM material when searching devices seized from cybercriminal suspects. While the mere possession of CSAM is a serious federal crime, not all of those caught with CSAM are necessarily creators or distributors of it. Fertel said some cybercriminal communities have been known to require new entrants to share CSAM material as a way of proving that they are not a federal investigator.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re going to the darkest corners of Internet, that&#8217;s how you prove you&#8217;re not law enforcement,&#8221; Fertel said. &#8220;Law enforcement would never share that material. It would be criminal for me as a prosecutor, if I obtained and possessed those types of images.&#8221;</p>
