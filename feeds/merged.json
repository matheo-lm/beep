But this past year, Interisle found the U.S. Postal Service was by far the most-phished entity, with more than four times the number of phishing domains as the second most-frequent target (Apple).\nAt least some of that increase is likely from a prolific cybercriminal using the nickname Chenlun, who\u00a0has been selling phishing kits targeting domestic postal services in the United States and at least a dozen other countries.\nInterisle says an increasing number of phishers are eschewing domain registrations altogether, and instead taking advantage of subdomain providers like blogspot.com, pages.dev, and weebly.com. The report notes that cyberattacks hosted at subdomain provider services can be tough to mitigate, because only the subdomain provider can disable malicious accounts or take down malicious web pages.\n\u201cAny action upstream, such as blocking the second-level domain, would have an impact across the provider\u2019s whole customer base,\u201d the report observes.\nInterisle tracked more than 1.18 million instances of subdomains used for phishing in the past year (a 114 percent increase), and found more than half of those were subdomains at blogspot.com and other services operated by Google.\n\u201cMany of these services allow the creation of large numbers of accounts at one time, which is highly exploited by criminals,\u201d the report concludes. \u201cSubdomain providers should limit the number of subdomains (user accounts) a customer can create at one time and suspend automated, high-volume automated account sign-ups \u2013 especially using free services.\u201d\nDec. 4, 10:21 a.m. ET: Corrected link to report.",

However, this person&#8217;s identity may not remain a secret for long: A careful review of Kiberphant0m&#8217;s daily chats across multiple cybercrime personas suggests they are a U.S. Army soldier who is or was recently stationed in South Korea.</p>\n<p>Kiberphant0m&#8217;s identities on cybercrime forums and on Telegram and Discord chat channels have been selling data stolen from customers of the cloud data storage company Snowflake. At the end of 2023, malicious hackers discovered that many companies had uploaded huge volumes of sensitive customer data to Snowflake accounts that were protected with nothing more than a username and password (no multi-factor authentication required).</p>\n<p>After scouring darknet markets for stolen Snowflake account credentials, the hackers began raiding the data storage repositories for some of the world\u2019s largest corporations.

Immediately after news broke of Moucka&#8217;s arrest, Kiberphant0m was clearly furious, and posted on the hacker community <strong>BreachForums</strong> what they claimed were the AT&amp;T call logs for <strong>President-elect</strong> <strong>Donald J.

On Nov. 9, Kiberphant0m posted a sales thread on BreachForums offering a &#8220;SIM-swapping&#8221; service targeting Verizon PTT customers. In a SIM-swap, fraudsters use credentials that are phished or stolen from mobile phone company employees to divert a target&#8217;s phone calls and text messages to a device they control.</p>\n<h2>MEET &#8216;BUTTHOLIO&#8217;</h2>\n<p>Kiberphant0m joined BreachForums in January 2024, but their public utterances on Discord and Telegram channels date back to at least early 2022. On their first post to BreachForums, Kiberphant0m said they could be reached at the Telegram handle <strong>@cyb3rph4nt0m</strong>.</p>\n<p>A review of @cyb3rph4nt0m shows this user has posted more than 4,200 messages since January 2024. Many of these messages were attempts to recruit people who could be hired to deploy a piece of malware that enslaved host machines in an Internet of Things (IoT) botnet.</p>\n<p>On BreachForums, Kiberphant0m has sold the source code to &#8220;<strong>Shi-Bot</strong>,&#8221; a custom Linux DDoS botnet based on <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/mirai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Mirai malware</a>. Kiberphant0m had few sales threads on BreachForums prior to the Snowflake attacks becoming public in May, and many of those involved databases stolen from companies in South Korea.</p>\n<p>On June 5, 2024, a Telegram user by the name &#8220;<strong>Buttholio</strong>&#8221; joined the fraud-focused Telegram channel &#8220;<strong>Comgirl</strong>&#8221; and claimed to be Kiberphant0m. Buttholio made the claim after being taunted as a nobody by another denizen of Comgirl, referring to their @cyb3rph4nt0m account on Telegram and the Kiberphant0m user on cybercrime forums.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Type &#8216;kiberphant0m&#8217; on google with the quotes,&#8221; Buttholio told another user. &#8220;I&#8217;ll wait.

However, Vars_Secc would be banned from XSS after attempting to sell access to the Russian telecommunications giant <strong>Rostelecom</strong>. [In this, Vars_Secc violated the Number One Rule for operating on a Russia-based crime forum: Never offer to hack or sell data stolen from Russian entities or citizens].</p>\n<p>On June 20, 2023, Vars_Secc posted a sales thread on the cybercrime forum <strong>Ramp 2.0</strong> titled, &#8220;Selling US Gov Financial Access.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Server within the network, possible to pivot,&#8221; Vars_Secc&#8217;s sparse sales post read. &#8220;Has 3-5 subroutes connected to it.

This story will be updated if they respond.</p>\n<p>The Vars_Secc telegram handle also has claimed ownership of the BreachForums member &#8220;<strong>Boxfan</strong>,&#8221; and Intel 471 shows Boxfan&#8217;s early posts on the forum had the Vars_Secc Telegram account in their signature. In their most recent post to BreachForums in January 2024, Boxfan disclosed a security vulnerability they found in <strong>Naver</strong>, the most popular search engine in South Korea (according to statista.com). Boxfan&#8217;s comments suggest they have strong negative feelings about South Korean culture.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Have fun exploiting this vulnerability,&#8221; Boxfan wrote on BreachForums, after pasting a long string of computer code intended to demonstrate the flaw. &#8220;Fuck you South Korea and your discriminatory views. Nobody likes ur shit kpop you evil fucks. Whoever can dump this DB [database] congrats. I don&#8217;t feel like doing it so I&#8217;ll post it to the forum.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The many identities tied to Kiberphant0m strongly suggest they are or until recently were a U.S. Army soldier stationed in South Korea.

                "content:encodedSnippet": "Two men have been arrested for allegedly stealing data from and extorting dozens of companies that used the cloud data storage company Snowflake, but a third suspect \u2014 a prolific hacker known as Kiberphant0m \u2014 remains at large and continues to publicly extort victims. However, this person\u2019s identity may not remain a secret for long: A careful review of Kiberphant0m\u2019s daily chats across multiple cybercrime personas suggests they are a U.S. Army soldier who is or was recently stationed in South Korea.\nKiberphant0m\u2019s identities on cybercrime forums and on Telegram and Discord chat channels have been selling data stolen from customers of the cloud data storage company Snowflake. At the end of 2023, malicious hackers discovered that many companies had uploaded huge volumes of sensitive customer data to Snowflake accounts that were protected with nothing more than a username and password (no multi-factor authentication required).\nAfter scouring darknet markets for stolen Snowflake account credentials, the hackers began raiding the data storage repositories for some of the world\u2019s largest corporations. Among those was AT&T, which\u00a0disclosed in July that cybercriminals had stolen personal information, phone and text message records for roughly 110 million people.\u00a0 Wired.com\u00a0reported in July\u00a0that AT&T paid a hacker $370,000 to delete stolen phone records.\nOn October 30, Canadian authorities arrested\u00a0Alexander Moucka,\u00a0a.k.a.\u00a0Connor Riley Moucka\u00a0of Kitchener, Ontario, on a provisional arrest warrant from the United States, which has since indicted him on 20 criminal counts connected to the Snowflake breaches. Another suspect in the Snowflake hacks, John Erin Binns, is an American who is currently incarcerated in Turkey.\n\nA surveillance photo of Connor Riley Moucka, a.k.a. \u201cJudische\u201d and \u201cWaifu,\u201d dated Oct 21, 2024, 9 days before Moucka\u2019s arrest. This image was included in an affidavit filed by an investigator with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).\n\nInvestigators say Moucka, who went by the handles Judische and Waifu, had tasked Kiberphant0m with selling data stolen from Snowflake customers who refused to pay a ransom to have their information deleted. Immediately after news broke of Moucka\u2019s arrest, Kiberphant0m was clearly furious, and posted on the hacker community BreachForums what they claimed were the AT&T call logs for President-elect Donald J. Trump and for Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\u201cIn the event you do not reach out to us @ATNT all presidential government call logs will be leaked,\u201d Kiberphant0m threatened, signing their post with multiple \u201c#FREEWAIFU\u201d tags. \u201cYou don\u2019t think we don\u2019t have plans in the event of an arrest? Think again.\u201d\nOn the same day, Kiberphant0m posted what they claimed was the \u201cdata schema\u201d from the U.S. National Security Agency.\n\u201cThis was obtained from the ATNT Snowflake hack which is why ATNT paid an extortion,\u201d Kiberphant0m wrote in a thread on BreachForums. \u201cWhy would ATNT pay Waifu for the data when they wouldn\u2019t even pay an extortion for over 20M+ SSNs?\u201d\n\nKiberphant0m posting what he claimed was a \u201cdata schema\u201d stolen from the NSA via AT&T.\n\nAlso on Nov. 5, Kiberphant0m offered call logs stolen from Verizon\u2019s push-to-talk (PTT) customers \u2014 mainly U.S. government agencies and emergency first responders. On Nov. 9, Kiberphant0m posted a sales thread on BreachForums offering a \u201cSIM-swapping\u201d service targeting Verizon PTT customers. In a SIM-swap, fraudsters use credentials that are phished or stolen from mobile phone company employees to divert a target\u2019s phone calls and text messages to a device they control.\nMEET \u2018BUTTHOLIO\u2019\nKiberphant0m joined BreachForums in January 2024, but their public utterances on Discord and Telegram channels date back to at least early 2022. On their first post to BreachForums, Kiberphant0m said they could be reached at the Telegram handle @cyb3rph4nt0m.\nA review of @cyb3rph4nt0m shows this user has posted more than 4,200 messages since January 2024. Many of these messages were attempts to recruit people who could be hired to deploy a piece of malware that enslaved host machines in an Internet of Things (IoT) botnet.\nOn BreachForums, Kiberphant0m has sold the source code to \u201cShi-Bot,\u201d a custom Linux DDoS botnet based on the Mirai malware. Kiberphant0m had few sales threads on BreachForums prior to the Snowflake attacks becoming public in May, and many of those involved databases stolen from companies in South Korea.\nOn June 5, 2024, a Telegram user by the name \u201cButtholio\u201d joined the fraud-focused Telegram channel \u201cComgirl\u201d and claimed to be Kiberphant0m. Buttholio made the claim after being taunted as a nobody by another denizen of Comgirl, referring to their @cyb3rph4nt0m account on Telegram and the Kiberphant0m user on cybercrime forums.\n\u201cType \u2018kiberphant0m\u2019 on google with the quotes,\u201d Buttholio told another user. \u201cI\u2019ll wait. Go ahead. Over 50 articles. 15+ telecoms breached. I got the IMSI number to every single person that\u2019s ever registered in Verizon, Tmobile, ATNT and Verifone.\u201d\nOn Sept. 17, 2023, Buttholio posted in a Discord chat room dedicated to players of the video game Escape from Tarkov. \u201cCome to Korea, servers there is pretty much no extract camper or cheater,\u201d Buttholio advised.\nIn another message that same day in the gaming Discord, Buttholio told others they bought the game in the United States, but that they were playing it in Asia.\n\u201cUSA is where the game was purchased from, server location is actual in game servers u play on. I am a u.s. soldier so i bought it in the states but got on rotation so i have to use asian servers,\u201d they shared.\n\u2018REVERSESHELL\u2019\nThe account @Kiberphant0m was assigned the Telegram ID number 6953392511. A review of this ID at the cyber intelligence platform Flashpoint shows that on January 4, 2024 Kibertphant0m posted to the Telegram channel \u201cDstat,\u201d which is populated by cybercriminals involved in launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and selling DDoS-for-hire services [Full disclosure: Flashpoint is currently an advertiser on this website].\nImmediately after Kiberphant0m logged on to the Dstat channel, another user wrote \u201chi buttholio,\u201d to which Kiberphant0m replied with an affirmative greeting \u201cwsg,\u201d or \u201cwhat\u2019s good.\u201d On Nov. 1, Dstat\u2019s website dstat[.]cc was seized as part of \u201cOperation PowerOFF,\u201d an international law enforcement action against DDoS services.\nFlashpoint\u2019s data shows that @kiberphant0m told a fellow member of Dstat on April 10, 2024 that their alternate Telegram username was \u201c@reverseshell,\u201d and did the same two weeks later in the Telegram chat The Jacuzzi. The Telegram ID for this account is 5408575119.\nWay back on Nov. 15, 2022, @reverseshell told a fellow member of a Telegram channel called Cecilio Chat that they were a soldier in the U.S. Army. This user also shared the following image of someone pictured waist-down in military fatigues, with a camouflaged backpack at their feet:\n\nKiberphant0m\u2019s apparent alias ReverseShell posted this image on a Telegram channel Cecilio Chat, on Nov. 15, 2022. Image: Flashpoint.\n\nIn September 2022, Reverseshell was embroiled in an argument with another member who had threatened to launch a DDoS attack against Reverseshell\u2019s Internet address. After the promised attack materialized, Reverseshell responded, \u201cYall just hit military base contracted wifi.\u201d\nIn a chat from October 2022, Reverseshell was bragging about the speed of the servers they were using, and in reply to another member\u2019s question said that they were accessing the Internet via South Korea Telecom.\nTelegram chat logs archived by Flashpoint show that on Aug. 23, 2022, Reverseshell bragged they\u2019d been using automated tools to find valid logins for Internet servers that they resold to others.\n\u201cI\u2019ve hit US gov servers with default creds,\u201d Reverseshell wrote, referring to systems with easy-to-guess usernames and/or passwords. \u201cTelecom control servers, machinery shops, Russian ISP servers, etc. I sold a few big companies for like $2-3k a piece. You can sell the access when you get a big SSH into corporation.\u201d\nOn July 29, 2023, Reverseshell posted a screenshot of a login page for a major U.S. defense contractor, claiming they had an aerospace company\u2019s credentials to sell.\nPROMAN AND VARS_SECC\nFlashpoint finds the Telegram ID 5408575119 has used several aliases since 2022, including Reverseshell and Proman557.\nA search on the username Proman557 at the cyber intelligence platform Intel 471 shows that a hacker by the name \u201cProman554\u201d registered on Hackforums in September 2022, and in messages to other users Proman554 said they can be reached at the Telegram account Buttholio.\nIntel 471 also finds the Proman557 moniker is one of many used by a person on the Russian-language hacking forum Exploit in 2022 who sold a variety of Linux-based botnet malware.\nProman557 was eventually banned \u2014 allegedly for scamming a fellow member out of $350 \u2014 and the Exploit moderator warned forum users that Proman557 had previously registered under several other nicknames, including an account called \u201cVars_Secc.\u201d\nVars_Secc\u2019s thousands of comments on Telegram over two years show this user divided their time between online gaming, maintaining a DDoS botnet, and promoting the sale or renting of their botnets to other users.\n\u201cI use ddos for many things not just to be a skid,\u201d Vars_Secc pronounced. \u201cWhy do you think I haven\u2019t sold my net?\u201d They then proceeded to list the most useful qualities of their botnet:\n-I use it to hit off servers that ban me or piss me off\n\nFlashpoint shows that in June 2023, Vars_Secc responded to taunting from a fellow member in the Telegram channel SecHub who had threatened to reveal their personal details to the federal government for a reward.\n\u201cMan I\u2019ve been doing this shit for 4 years,\u201d Vars_Secc replied nonchalantly. \u201cI highly doubt the government is going to pay millions of dollars for data on some random dude operating a pointless ddos botnet and finding a few vulnerabilities here and there.\u201d\nFor several months in 2023, Vars_Secc also was an active member of the Russian-language crime forum XSS, where they sold access to a U.S. government server for $2,000. However, Vars_Secc would be banned from XSS after attempting to sell access to the Russian telecommunications giant Rostelecom. [In this, Vars_Secc violated the Number One Rule for operating on a Russia-based crime forum: Never offer to hack or sell data stolen from Russian entities or citizens].\nOn June 20, 2023, Vars_Secc posted a sales thread on the cybercrime forum Ramp 2.0 titled, \u201cSelling US Gov Financial Access.\u201d\n\u201cServer within the network, possible to pivot,\u201d Vars_Secc\u2019s sparse sales post read. \u201cHas 3-5 subroutes connected to it. Price $1,250. Telegram: Vars_Secc.\u201d\nVars_Secc also used Ramp in June 2023 to sell access to a \u201cVietnam government Internet Network Information Center.\u201d\n\u201cSelling access server allocated within the network,\u201d Vars_Secc wrote. \u201cHas some data on it. $500.\u201d\nBUG BOUNTIES\nThe Vars_Secc identity claimed on Telegram in May 2023 that they made money by submitting reports about software flaws to HackerOne, a company that helps technology firms field reports about security vulnerabilities in their products and services. Specifically, Vars_Secc said they had earned financial rewards or \u201cbug bounties\u201d from reddit.com, the U.S. Department of Defense, and Coinbase, among 30 others.\n\u201cI make money off bug bounties, it\u2019s quite simple,\u201d Vars_Secc said when asked what they do for a living. \u201cThat\u2019s why I have over 30 bug bounty reports on HackerOne.\u201d\nA month before that, Vars_Secc said they\u2019d found a vulnerability in reddit.com.\n\u201cI poisoned Reddit\u2019s cache,\u201d they explained. \u201cI\u2019m going to exploit it further, then report it to reddit.\u201d\nKrebsOnSecurity sought comment from HackerOne, which said it would investigate the claims. This story will be updated if they respond.\nThe Vars_Secc telegram handle also has claimed ownership of the BreachForums member \u201cBoxfan,\u201d and Intel 471 shows Boxfan\u2019s early posts on the forum had the Vars_Secc Telegram account in their signature. In their most recent post to BreachForums in January 2024, Boxfan disclosed a security vulnerability they found in Naver, the most popular search engine in South Korea (according to statista.com). Boxfan\u2019s comments suggest they have strong negative feelings about South Korean culture.\n\u201cHave fun exploiting this vulnerability,\u201d Boxfan wrote on BreachForums, after pasting a long string of computer code intended to demonstrate the flaw. \u201cFuck you South Korea and your discriminatory views. Nobody likes ur shit kpop you evil fucks. Whoever can dump this DB [database] congrats. I don\u2019t feel like doing it so I\u2019ll post it to the forum.\u201d\nThe many identities tied to Kiberphant0m strongly suggest they are or until recently were a U.S. Army soldier stationed in South Korea. Kiberphant0m\u2019s alter egos never mentioned their military rank, regiment, or specialization.\nHowever, it is likely that Kiberphant0m\u2019s facility with computers and networking was noticed by the Army. According to the U.S. Army\u2019s website, the bulk of its forces in South Korea reside within the Eighth Army, which has a dedicated cyber operations unit focused on defending against cyber threats.\nOn April 1, 2023, Vars_Secc posted to a public Telegram chat channel a screenshot of the National Security Agency\u2019s website. The image indicated the visitor had just applied for some type of job at the NSA.\n\nA screenshot posted by Vars_Secc on Telegram on April 1, 2023, suggesting they just applied for a job at the National Security Agency.\n\nThe NSA has not yet responded to requests for comment.\nReached via Telegram, Kiberphant0m acknowledged that KrebsOnSecurity managed to unearth their old handles.\n\u201cI see you found the IP behind it no way,\u201d Kiberphant0m replied. \u201cI see you managed to find my old aliases LOL.\u201d\nKiberphant0m denied being in the U.S. Army or ever being in South Korea, and said all of that was a lengthy ruse designed to create a fictitious persona. \u201cEpic opsec troll,\u201d they claimed.\nAsked if they were at all concerned about getting busted, Kiberphant0m called that an impossibility.\n\u201cI literally can\u2019t get caught,\u201d Kiberphant0m said, declining an invitation to explain why. \u201cI don\u2019t even live in the USA Mr. Krebs.\u201d\nBelow is a mind map that hopefully helps illustrate some of the connections between and among Kiberphant0m\u2019s apparent alter egos.\n\nA mind map of the connections between and among the identities apparently used by Kiberphant0m. Click to enlarge.\n\nKrebsOnSecurity would like to extend a special note of thanks to the New York City based security intelligence firm Unit 221B for their assistance in helping to piece together key elements of Kiberphant0m\u2019s different identities.",

Finastra, which provides software and services to 45 of the world&#8217;s top 50 banks, notified customers of the security incident after a cybercriminal began selling more than 400 gigabytes of data purportedly stolen from the company.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-50961\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/finastra.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"747\" height=\"453\" /></p>\n<p>London-based Finastra has offices in 42 countries and reported $1.9 billion in revenues last year. The company employs more than 7,000 people and serves approximately 8,100 financial institutions around the world. A major part of Finastra&#8217;s day-to-day business involves processing huge volumes of digital files containing instructions for wire and bank transfers on behalf of its clients.</p>\n<p>On November 8, 2024, Finastra notified financial institution customers that on Nov. 7 its security team detected suspicious activity on Finastra&#8217;s internally hosted file transfer platform. Finastra also told customers that someone had begun selling large volumes of files allegedly stolen from its systems.</p>\n<p>&#8220;On November 8, a threat actor communicated on the dark web claiming to have data exfiltrated from this platform,&#8221; reads <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/finastra-notice.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Finastra&#8217;s disclosure</a>, a copy of which was shared by a source at one of the customer firms.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There is no direct impact on customer operations, our customers&#8217; systems, or Finastra&#8217;s ability to serve our customers currently,&#8221; the notice continued. &#8220;We have implemented an alternative secure file sharing platform to ensure continuity, and investigations are ongoing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But its notice to customers does indicate the intruder managed to extract or &#8220;exfiltrate&#8221; an unspecified volume of customer data.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The threat actor did not deploy malware or tamper with any customer files within the environment,&#8221; the notice reads. &#8220;Furthermore, no files other than the exfiltrated files were viewed or accessed. We remain focused on determining the scope and nature of the data contained within the exfiltrated files.&#8221;<span id=\"more-69538\"></span></p>\n<p>In a written statement in response to questions about the incident, Finastra said it has been &#8220;actively and transparently responding to our customers\u2019 questions and keeping them informed about what we do and do not yet know about the data that was posted.&#8221; The company also shared an updated communication to its clients, which said while it was still investigating the root cause, &#8220;initial evidence points to credentials that were compromised.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Additionally, we have been sharing Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and our CISO has been speaking directly with our customers\u2019 security teams to provide updates on the investigation and our eDiscovery process,&#8221; the statement continues. Here is the rest of what they shared:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;In terms of eDiscovery, we are analyzing the data to determine what specific customers were affected, while simultaneously assessing and communicating which of our products are not dependent on the specific version of the SFTP platform that was compromised. The impacted SFTP platform is not used by all customers and is not the default platform used by Finastra or its customers to exchange data files associated with a broad suite of our products, so we are working as quickly as possible to rule out affected customers. However, as you can imagine, this is a time-intensive process because we have many large customers that leverage different Finastra products in different parts of their business. We are prioritizing accuracy and transparency in our communications.</p>\n<p>Importantly, for any customers who are deemed to be affected, we will be reaching out and working with them directly.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>On Nov. 8, a cybercriminal using the nickname &#8220;<strong>abyss0</strong>&#8221; posted on the English-language cybercrime community <strong>BreachForums</strong> that they&#8217;d stolen files belonging to some of Finastra&#8217;s largest banking clients. The data auction did not specify a starting or &#8220;buy it now&#8221; price, but said interested buyers should reach out to them on Telegram.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69542\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/finastra-sales-nov8.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69542\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-69542\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/finastra-sales-nov8.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"489\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/finastra-sales-nov8.png 1052w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/finastra-sales-nov8-768x500.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/finastra-sales-nov8-782x509.png 782w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-69542\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">abyss0&#8217;s Nov. 7 sales thread on BreachForums included many screenshots showing the file directory listings for various Finastra customers.

A review of abyss0&#8217;s posts to BreachForums reveals this user has offered to sell databases stolen in several dozen other breaches advertised over the past six months.</p>\n<p>The apparent timeline of this breach suggests abyss0 gained access to Finastra&#8217;s file sharing system at least a week before the company says it first detected suspicious activity, and that the Nov. 7 activity cited by Finastra may have been the intruder returning to exfiltrate more data.</p>\n<p>Maybe abyss0 found a buyer who paid for their early retirement.

                "content:encodedSnippet": "The financial technology firm Finastra is investigating the alleged large-scale theft of information from its internal file transfer platform, KrebsOnSecurity has learned. Finastra, which provides software and services to 45 of the world\u2019s top 50 banks, notified customers of the security incident after a cybercriminal began selling more than 400 gigabytes of data purportedly stolen from the company.\n\nLondon-based Finastra has offices in 42 countries and reported $1.9 billion in revenues last year. The company employs more than 7,000 people and serves approximately 8,100 financial institutions around the world. A major part of Finastra\u2019s day-to-day business involves processing huge volumes of digital files containing instructions for wire and bank transfers on behalf of its clients.\nOn November 8, 2024, Finastra notified financial institution customers that on Nov. 7 its security team detected suspicious activity on Finastra\u2019s internally hosted file transfer platform. Finastra also told customers that someone had begun selling large volumes of files allegedly stolen from its systems.\n\u201cOn November 8, a threat actor communicated on the dark web claiming to have data exfiltrated from this platform,\u201d reads Finastra\u2019s disclosure, a copy of which was shared by a source at one of the customer firms.\n\u201cThere is no direct impact on customer operations, our customers\u2019 systems, or Finastra\u2019s ability to serve our customers currently,\u201d the notice continued. \u201cWe have implemented an alternative secure file sharing platform to ensure continuity, and investigations are ongoing.\u201d\nBut its notice to customers does indicate the intruder managed to extract or \u201cexfiltrate\u201d an unspecified volume of customer data.\n\u201cThe threat actor did not deploy malware or tamper with any customer files within the environment,\u201d the notice reads. \u201cFurthermore, no files other than the exfiltrated files were viewed or accessed. We remain focused on determining the scope and nature of the data contained within the exfiltrated files.\u201d\nIn a written statement in response to questions about the incident, Finastra said it has been \u201cactively and transparently responding to our customers\u2019 questions and keeping them informed about what we do and do not yet know about the data that was posted.\u201d The company also shared an updated communication to its clients, which said while it was still investigating the root cause, \u201cinitial evidence points to credentials that were compromised.\u201d\n\u201cAdditionally, we have been sharing Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and our CISO has been speaking directly with our customers\u2019 security teams to provide updates on the investigation and our eDiscovery process,\u201d the statement continues. Here is the rest of what they shared:\n\u201cIn terms of eDiscovery, we are analyzing the data to determine what specific customers were affected, while simultaneously assessing and communicating which of our products are not dependent on the specific version of the SFTP platform that was compromised. The impacted SFTP platform is not used by all customers and is not the default platform used by Finastra or its customers to exchange data files associated with a broad suite of our products, so we are working as quickly as possible to rule out affected customers. However, as you can imagine, this is a time-intensive process because we have many large customers that leverage different Finastra products in different parts of their business. We are prioritizing accuracy and transparency in our communications.\nImportantly, for any customers who are deemed to be affected, we will be reaching out and working with them directly.\u201d\n\nOn Nov. 8, a cybercriminal using the nickname \u201cabyss0\u201d posted on the English-language cybercrime community BreachForums that they\u2019d stolen files belonging to some of Finastra\u2019s largest banking clients. The data auction did not specify a starting or \u201cbuy it now\u201d price, but said interested buyers should reach out to them on Telegram.\n\nabyss0\u2019s Nov. 7 sales thread on BreachForums included many screenshots showing the file directory listings for various Finastra customers. Image: Ke-la.com.\n\nAccording to screenshots collected by the cyber intelligence platform Ke-la.com, abyss0 first attempted to sell the data allegedly stolen from Finastra on October 31, but that earlier sales thread did not name the victim company. However, it did reference many of the same banks called out as Finastra customers in the Nov. 8 post on BreachForums.\n\nThe original October 31 post from abyss0, where they advertise the sale of data from several large banks that are customers of a large financial software company. Image: Ke-la.com.\n\nThe October sales thread also included a starting price: $20,000. By Nov. 3, that price had been reduced to $10,000. A review of abyss0\u2019s posts to BreachForums reveals this user has offered to sell databases stolen in several dozen other breaches advertised over the past six months.\nThe apparent timeline of this breach suggests abyss0 gained access to Finastra\u2019s file sharing system at least a week before the company says it first detected suspicious activity, and that the Nov. 7 activity cited by Finastra may have been the intruder returning to exfiltrate more data.\nMaybe abyss0 found a buyer who paid for their early retirement. We may never know, because this person has effectively vanished. The Telegram account that abyss0 listed in their sales thread appears to have been suspended or deleted. Likewise, abyss0\u2019s account on BreachForums no longer exists, and all of their sales threads have since disappeared.\nIt seems improbable that both Telegram and BreachForums would have given this user the boot at the same time. The simplest explanation is that something spooked abyss0 enough for them to abandon a number of pending sales opportunities, in addition to a well-manicured cybercrime persona.\nIn March 2020, Finastra suffered a ransomware attack that sidelined a number of the company\u2019s core businesses for days. According to reporting from Bloomberg, Finastra was able to recover from that incident without paying a ransom.\nThis is a developing story. Updates will be noted with timestamps.

In February, he and Ermakov were arrested on charges of operating a short-lived ransomware affiliate program in 2021 called <strong>Sugar</strong> (a.k.a.

Ermakov was recently found guilty and given two years probation.</p>\n<p>Shefel claims his Sugar ransomware affiliate program was a bust, and never generated any profits. Russia is known for not prosecuting criminal hackers within its borders who scrupulously avoid attacking Russian businesses and consumers. When asked why he now faces prosecution over Sugar, Shefel said he&#8217;s certain the investigation was instigated by\u00a0 <strong>Pyotr &#8220;Peter&#8221; Vrublevsky</strong> &#8212; the son of his former boss at ChronoPay.</p>\n<p>ChronoPay founder and CEO <strong>Pavel Vrublevsky</strong> was the key subject of my 2014 book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Spam-Nation-Organized-Cybercrime-Epidemic-ebook/dp/B00L5QGBL0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Spam Nation</em></a>, which described his role as head of one of Russia&#8217;s most notorious criminal spam operations.</p>\n<p>Vrublevsky Sr. recently declared bankruptcy, and is currently in prison on fraud charges. Russian authorities allege Vrublevsky operated several fraudulent SMS-based payment schemes. They also accused Vrublevsky of facilitating money laundering for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydra_Market\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hydra</a>, the largest Russian darknet market at the time. Hydra trafficked in illegal drugs and financial services, including cryptocurrency tumbling for money laundering, exchange services between cryptocurrency and Russian rubles, and the sale of falsified documents and hacking services.</p>\n<p>However, in 2022 KrebsOnSecurity reported on <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/03/spam-nation-villain-vrublevsky-charged-with-fraud/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a more likely reason for Vrublevsky&#8217;s latest criminal charges</a>: He&#8217;d been extensively documenting the nicknames, real names and criminal exploits of Russian hackers who worked with the protection of corrupt officials in the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), and operating a Telegram channel that threatened to expose alleged nefarious dealings by Russian financial executives.</p>\n<p>Shefel believes Vrublevsky&#8217;s son Peter paid corrupt cops to levy criminal charges against him after reporting the youth to Moscow police, allegedly for walking around in public with a loaded firearm.

Sugar Locker), which targeted single computers and end-users instead of corporations. Shefel is due to face those charges in a Moscow court on Friday, Nov. 15, 2024. Ermakov was recently found guilty and given two years probation.\nShefel claims his Sugar ransomware affiliate program was a bust, and never generated any profits. Russia is known for not prosecuting criminal hackers within its borders who scrupulously avoid attacking Russian businesses and consumers. When asked why he now faces prosecution over Sugar, Shefel said he\u2019s certain the investigation was instigated by\u00a0 Pyotr \u201cPeter\u201d Vrublevsky \u2014 the son of his former boss at ChronoPay.\nChronoPay founder and CEO Pavel Vrublevsky was the key subject of my 2014 book Spam Nation, which described his role as head of one of Russia\u2019s most notorious criminal spam operations.\nVrublevsky Sr. recently declared bankruptcy, and is currently in prison on fraud charges. Russian authorities allege Vrublevsky operated several fraudulent SMS-based payment schemes. They also accused Vrublevsky of facilitating money laundering for Hydra, the largest Russian darknet market at the time. Hydra trafficked in illegal drugs and financial services, including cryptocurrency tumbling for money laundering, exchange services between cryptocurrency and Russian rubles, and the sale of falsified documents and hacking services.\nHowever, in 2022 KrebsOnSecurity reported on a more likely reason for Vrublevsky\u2019s latest criminal charges: He\u2019d been extensively documenting the nicknames, real names and criminal exploits of Russian hackers who worked with the protection of corrupt officials in the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), and operating a Telegram channel that threatened to expose alleged nefarious dealings by Russian financial executives.\nShefel believes Vrublevsky\u2019s son Peter paid corrupt cops to levy criminal charges against him after reporting the youth to Moscow police, allegedly for walking around in public with a loaded firearm. Shefel says the Russian authorities told the younger Vrublevsky that he had lodged the firearms complaint.\nIn July 2024, the Russian news outlet Izvestia published a lengthy investigation into Peter Vrublevsky, alleging that the younger son took up his father\u2019s mantle and was responsible for advertising Sprut, a Russian-language narcotics bazaar that sprang to life after the Hydra darknet market was shut down by international law enforcement agencies in 2022.\n\nIzvestia reports that Peter Vrublevsky was the advertising mastermind behind this 3D ad campaign and others promoting the Russian online narcotics bazaar Sprut.\n\nIzvestia reports that Peter Vrublevsky is currently living in Switzerland, where he reportedly fled in 2022 after being \u201carrested in absentia\u201d in Russia on charges of running a violent group that could be hired via Telegram to conduct a range of physical attacks in real life, including firebombings and muggings.\nShefel claims his former partner Golubov was involved in the development and dissemination of early ransomware strains, including Cryptolocker, and that Golubov remains active in the cybercrime community.\nMeanwhile, Mr. Shefel portrays himself as someone who is barely scraping by with the few odd coding jobs that come his way each month. Incredibly, the day after our initial interview via Telegram, Shefel proposed going into business together.\nBy way of example, he suggested maybe a company centered around recovering lost passwords for cryptocurrency accounts, or perhaps a series of online retail stores that sold cheap Chinese goods at a steep markup in the United States.\n\u201cHi, how are you?\u201d he inquired. \u201cMaybe we can open business?\u201d",

But increasingly, thieves are relying on fake EDRs, which allow investigators to attest that people will be bodily harmed or killed unless a request for account data is granted expeditiously.</p>\n<p>The trouble is, these EDRs largely bypass any official review and do not require the requester to supply any court-approved documents. Also, it is difficult for a company that receives one of these EDRs to immediately determine whether it is legitimate.</p>\n<p>In this scenario, the receiving company finds itself caught between two unsavory outcomes: Failing to immediately comply with an EDR \u2014 and potentially having someone\u2019s blood on their hands \u2014 or possibly leaking a customer record to the wrong person.</p>\n<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, compliance with such requests tends to be extremely high. For example, in its most recent <a href=\"https://www.verizon.com/about/sites/default/files/US-Transparency-Report-2H-2023.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">transparency report</a> (PDF) <strong>Verizon</strong> said it received more than 127,000 law enforcement demands for customer data in the second half of 2023 &#8212; including more than 36,000 EDRs &#8212; and that the company provided records in response to approximately 90 percent of requests.</p>\n<p>One English-speaking cybercriminal who goes by the nicknames &#8220;<strong>Pwnstar</strong>&#8221; and &#8220;<strong>Pwnipotent</strong>&#8221; has been selling fake EDR services on both Russian-language and English cybercrime forums. Their prices range from $1,000 to $3,000 per successful request, and they claim to control &#8220;gov emails from over 25 countries,&#8221; including Argentina, Bangladesh, Brazil, Bolivia, Dominican Republic, Hungary, India, Kenya, Jordan, Lebanon, Laos, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Tunisia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Vietnam.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I cannot 100% guarantee every order will go through,&#8221; Pwnstar explained. &#8220;This is social engineering at the highest level and there will be failed attempts at times. Don&#8217;t be discouraged. You can use escrow and I give full refund back if EDR doesn&#8217;t go through and you don&#8217;t receive your information.&#8221;<span id=\"more-69445\"></span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69453\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69453\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-69453\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/pwnstar.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"644\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/pwnstar.png 1001w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/pwnstar-768x660.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/pwnstar-782x672.png 782w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-69453\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">An ad from Pwnstar for fake EDR services.</p></div>\n<p>A review of EDR vendors across many cybercrime forums shows that some fake EDR vendors sell the ability to send phony police requests to specific social media platforms, including forged court-approved documents. Others simply sell access to hacked government or police email accounts, and leave it up to the buyer to forge any needed documents.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When you get account, it&#8217;s yours, your account, your liability,&#8221; reads an ad in October on <strong>BreachForums</strong>. &#8220;Unlimited Emergency Data Requests. Once Paid, the Logins are completely Yours. Reset as you please. You would need to Forge Documents to Successfully Emergency Data Request.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Still other fake EDR service vendors claim to sell hacked or fraudulently created accounts on <strong>Kodex</strong>, a startup that aims to help tech companies do a better job screening out phony law enforcement data requests. Kodex is <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/04/fighting-fake-edrs-with-credit-ratings-for-police/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">trying to tackle the problem of fake EDRs</a> by working directly with the data providers to pool information about police or government officials submitting these requests, with an eye toward making it easier for everyone to spot an unauthorized EDR.</p>\n<p>If police or government officials wish to request records regarding Coinbase customers, for example, they must first register an account on Kodexglobal.com. Kodex&#8217;s systems then assign that requestor a score or credit rating, wherein officials who have a long history of sending valid legal requests will have a higher rating than someone sending an EDR for the first time.</p>\n<p>It is not uncommon to see fake EDR vendors claim the ability to send data requests through Kodex, with some even sharing redacted screenshots of police accounts at Kodex.</p>\n<p><strong>Matt Donahue</strong> is the former FBI agent who founded Kodex in 2021. Donahue said just because someone can use a legitimate police department or government email to create a Kodex account doesn&#8217;t mean that user will be able to send anything. Donahue said even if one customer gets a fake request, Kodex is able to prevent the same thing from happening to another.</p>\n<p>Kodex told KrebsOnSecurity that over the past 12 months it has processed a total of 1,597 EDRs, and that 485 of those requests (~30 percent) failed a second-level verification. Kodex reports it has suspended nearly 4,000 law enforcement users in the past year, including:</p>\n<p>-1,521 from the Asia-Pacific region;<br />\n-1,290 requests from Europe, the Middle East and Asia;<br />\n-460 from police departments and agencies in the United States;<br />\n-385 from entities in Latin America, and;<br />\n-285 from Brazil.</p>\n<p>Donahue said 60 technology companies are now routing all law enforcement data requests through Kodex, including an increasing number of financial institutions and cryptocurrency platforms.

                "content:encodedSnippet": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is urging police departments and governments worldwide to beef up security around their email systems, citing a recent increase in cybercriminal services that use hacked police email accounts to send unauthorized subpoenas and customer data requests to U.S.-based technology companies.\n\nIn an alert (PDF) published this week, the FBI said it has seen an uptick in postings on criminal forums regarding the process of emergency data requests (EDRs) and the sale of email credentials stolen from police departments and government agencies.\n\u201cCybercriminals are likely gaining access to compromised US and foreign government email addresses and using them to conduct fraudulent emergency data requests to US based companies, exposing the personal information of customers to further use for criminal purposes,\u201d the FBI warned.\nIn the United States, when federal, state or local law enforcement agencies wish to obtain information about an account at a technology provider \u2014 such as the account\u2019s email address, or what Internet addresses a specific cell phone account has used in the past \u2014 they must submit an official court-ordered warrant or subpoena.\nVirtually all major technology companies serving large numbers of users online have departments that routinely review and process such requests, which are typically granted (eventually, and at least in part) as long as the proper documents are provided and the request appears to come from an email address connected to an actual police department domain name.\nIn some cases, a cybercriminal will offer to forge a court-approved subpoena and send that through a hacked police or government email account. But increasingly, thieves are relying on fake EDRs, which allow investigators to attest that people will be bodily harmed or killed unless a request for account data is granted expeditiously.\nThe trouble is, these EDRs largely bypass any official review and do not require the requester to supply any court-approved documents. Also, it is difficult for a company that receives one of these EDRs to immediately determine whether it is legitimate.\nIn this scenario, the receiving company finds itself caught between two unsavory outcomes: Failing to immediately comply with an EDR \u2014 and potentially having someone\u2019s blood on their hands \u2014 or possibly leaking a customer record to the wrong person.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, compliance with such requests tends to be extremely high. For example, in its most recent transparency report (PDF) Verizon said it received more than 127,000 law enforcement demands for customer data in the second half of 2023 \u2014 including more than 36,000 EDRs \u2014 and that the company provided records in response to approximately 90 percent of requests.\nOne English-speaking cybercriminal who goes by the nicknames \u201cPwnstar\u201d and \u201cPwnipotent\u201d has been selling fake EDR services on both Russian-language and English cybercrime forums. Their prices range from $1,000 to $3,000 per successful request, and they claim to control \u201cgov emails from over 25 countries,\u201d including Argentina, Bangladesh, Brazil, Bolivia, Dominican Republic, Hungary, India, Kenya, Jordan, Lebanon, Laos, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Tunisia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Vietnam.\n\u201cI cannot 100% guarantee every order will go through,\u201d Pwnstar explained. \u201cThis is social engineering at the highest level and there will be failed attempts at times. Don\u2019t be discouraged. You can use escrow and I give full refund back if EDR doesn\u2019t go through and you don\u2019t receive your information.\u201d\n\nAn ad from Pwnstar for fake EDR services.\n\nA review of EDR vendors across many cybercrime forums shows that some fake EDR vendors sell the ability to send phony police requests to specific social media platforms, including forged court-approved documents. Others simply sell access to hacked government or police email accounts, and leave it up to the buyer to forge any needed documents.\n\u201cWhen you get account, it\u2019s yours, your account, your liability,\u201d reads an ad in October on BreachForums. \u201cUnlimited Emergency Data Requests. Once Paid, the Logins are completely Yours. Reset as you please. You would need to Forge Documents to Successfully Emergency Data Request.\u201d\nStill other fake EDR service vendors claim to sell hacked or fraudulently created accounts on Kodex, a startup that aims to help tech companies do a better job screening out phony law enforcement data requests. Kodex is trying to tackle the problem of fake EDRs by working directly with the data providers to pool information about police or government officials submitting these requests, with an eye toward making it easier for everyone to spot an unauthorized EDR.\nIf police or government officials wish to request records regarding Coinbase customers, for example, they must first register an account on Kodexglobal.com. Kodex\u2019s systems then assign that requestor a score or credit rating, wherein officials who have a long history of sending valid legal requests will have a higher rating than someone sending an EDR for the first time.\nIt is not uncommon to see fake EDR vendors claim the ability to send data requests through Kodex, with some even sharing redacted screenshots of police accounts at Kodex.\nMatt Donahue is the former FBI agent who founded Kodex in 2021. Donahue said just because someone can use a legitimate police department or government email to create a Kodex account doesn\u2019t mean that user will be able to send anything. Donahue said even if one customer gets a fake request, Kodex is able to prevent the same thing from happening to another.\nKodex told KrebsOnSecurity that over the past 12 months it has processed a total of 1,597 EDRs, and that 485 of those requests (~30 percent) failed a second-level verification. Kodex reports it has suspended nearly 4,000 law enforcement users in the past year, including:\n-1,521 from the Asia-Pacific region;\nDonahue said 60 technology companies are now routing all law enforcement data requests through Kodex, including an increasing number of financial institutions and cryptocurrency platforms. He said one concern shared by recent prospective customers is that crooks are seeking to use phony law enforcement requests to freeze and in some cases seize funds in specific accounts.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s being conflated [with EDRs] is anything that doesn\u2019t involve a formal judge\u2019s signature or legal process,\u201d Donahue said. \u201cThat can include control over data, like an account freeze or preservation request.\u201d\nIn a hypothetical example, a scammer uses a hacked government email account to request that a service provider place a hold on a specific bank or crypto account that is allegedly subject to a garnishment order, or party to crime that is globally sanctioned, such as terrorist financing or child exploitation.\nA few days or weeks later, the same impersonator returns with a request to seize funds in the account, or to divert the funds to a custodial wallet supposedly controlled by government investigators.\n\u201cIn terms of overall social engineering attacks, the more you have a relationship with someone the more they\u2019re going to trust you,\u201d Donahue said. \u201cIf you send them a freeze order, that\u2019s a way to establish trust, because [the first time] they\u2019re not asking for information. They\u2019re just saying, \u2018Hey can you do me a favor?\u2019 And that makes the [recipient] feel valued.\u201d\nEchoing the FBI\u2019s warning, Donahue said far too many police departments in the United States and other countries have poor account security hygiene, and often do not enforce basic account security precautions \u2014 such as requiring phishing-resistant multifactor authentication.\nHow are cybercriminals typically gaining access to police and government email accounts? Donahue said it\u2019s still mostly email-based phishing, and credentials that are stolen by opportunistic malware infections and sold on the dark web. But as bad as things are internationally, he said, many law enforcement entities in the United States still have much room for improvement in account security.\n\u201cUnfortunately, a lot of this is phishing or malware campaigns,\u201d Donahue said. \u201cA lot of global police agencies don\u2019t have stringent cybersecurity hygiene, but even U.S. dot-gov emails get hacked.

After scouring darknet markets for stolen Snowflake account credentials, the hackers began raiding the data storage repositories used by some of the world\u2019s largest corporations.</p>\n<p>Among those was <strong>AT&amp;T</strong>, which\u00a0<a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/07/hackers-steal-phone-sms-records-for-nearly-all-att-customers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">disclosed in July</a> that cybercriminals had stolen personal information and phone and text message records for roughly 110 million people \u2014 nearly all of its customers. <strong>Wired.com</strong> <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/atandt-paid-hacker-300000-to-delete-stolen-call-records/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported in July</a> that AT&amp;T paid a hacker $370,000 to delete stolen phone records.</p>\n<p>A report on the extortion attacks from the incident response firm <strong>Mandiant</strong> notes that Snowflake victim companies were privately approached by the hackers, who demanded a ransom in exchange for a promise not to sell or leak the stolen data. All told, more than 160 Snowflake customers were relieved of data, including <strong>TicketMaster</strong>,\u00a0<strong>Lending Tree</strong>,\u00a0<strong>Advance Auto Parts</strong>\u00a0and\u00a0<strong>Neiman Marcus</strong>.</p>\n<p>Moucka is alleged to have used the hacker handles <strong>Judische</strong> and <strong>Waifu</strong>, among many others. These monikers correspond to a prolific cybercriminal whose exploits were the subject of <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/09/the-dark-nexus-between-harm-groups-and-the-com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a recent story published here</a> about the overlap between Western, English-speaking cybercriminals and extremist groups that harass and extort minors into harming themselves or others.</p>\n<p>On May 2, 2024, Judische claimed on the fraud-focused Telegram channel <strong>Star Chat</strong> that they had hacked <strong>Santander Bank</strong>, one of the first known Snowflake victims. Judische would repeat that claim in Star Chat on May 13 \u2014 the day before Santander publicly disclosed a data breach \u2014 and would periodically blurt out the names of other Snowflake victims before their data even went up for sale on the cybercrime forums.</p>\n<p>404 Media <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/alleged-snowflake-hacker-appears-in-court-says-prison-in-lockdown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reports</a> that at a court hearing in Ontario this morning, Moucka called in from a prison phone and said he was seeking legal aid to hire an attorney.</p>\n<h2>TELECOM DOMINOES</h2>\n<p>Mandiant has attributed the Snowflake compromises to a group it calls \u201c<strong>UNC5537</strong>,\u201d with members based in North America and\u00a0<a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/08/t-mobile-investigating-claims-of-massive-data-breach/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Turkey</a>. Sources close to the investigation tell KrebsOnSecurity the UNC5537 member in Turkey is <strong>John Erin Binns</strong>, an elusive American man indicted by the\u00a0<strong>U.S. Department of Justice</strong>\u00a0(DOJ) for\u00a0<a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/08/t-mobile-investigating-claims-of-massive-data-breach/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a 2021 breach at T-Mobile</a> that exposed the personal information of at least 76.6 million customers.</p>\n<p><strong>Update</strong>: The Justice Department has <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">unsealed an indictment</a> (PDF) against Moucka and Binns, charging them with one count of conspiracy; 10 counts of wire fraud; four counts of computer fraud and abuse; two counts of extortion in relation to computer fraud; and two counts aggravated identity theft.</p>\n<p>In a statement on Moucka&#8217;s arrest, Mandiant said UNC5537 aka Alexander \u2018Connor\u2019 Moucka has proven to be one of the most consequential threat actors of 2024.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In April 2024, UNC5537 launched a campaign, systematically compromising misconfigured SaaS instances across over a hundred organizations,&#8221; wrote <strong>Austin Larsen</strong>, Mandiant&#8217;s senior threat analyst. &#8220;The operation, which left organizations reeling from significant data loss and extortion attempts, highlighted the alarming scale of harm an individual can cause using off-the-shelf tools.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sources involved in the investigation said UNC5537 has focused on hacking into telecommunications companies around the world. Those sources told KrebsOnSecurity that Binns and Judische are suspected of <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/bsnl-suffers-second-data-breach-in-six-months/articleshow/111264707.cms?from=mdr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stealing data from India&#8217;s largest state-run telecommunications firm</a> <strong>Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd</strong> (BNSL), and that the duo even bragged about being able to intercept or divert phone calls and text messages for a large portion of the population of India.</p>\n<p>Judische appears to have outsourced the sale of databases from victim companies who refuse to pay, delegating some of that work to a cybercriminal who uses the nickname <strong>Kiberphant0m</strong> on multiple forums. In late May 2024, Kiberphant0m began advertising the sale of hundreds of gigabytes of data stolen from BSNL.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Information is worth several million dollars but I&#8217;m selling for pretty cheap,&#8221; Kiberphant0m wrote of the BSNL data in a post on the English-language cybercrime community <strong>Breach Forums</strong>. &#8220;Negotiate a deal in Telegram.&#8221;</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-69334\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/kiberphant0m-bf.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"310\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/kiberphant0m-bf.png 1115w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/kiberphant0m-bf-768x317.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/kiberphant0m-bf-782x323.png 782w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></p>\n<p>Also in May 2024, Kiberphant0m took to the Russian-language hacking forum <strong>XSS</strong> to sell more than 250 gigabytes of data stolen from an unnamed mobile telecom provider in Asia, including a database of all active customers and software allowing the sending of text messages to all customers.</p>\n<p>On September 3, 2024, Kiberphant0m posted a sales thread on XSS titled &#8220;Selling American Telecom Access (100B+ Revenue).&#8221; Kiberphant0m&#8217;s asking price of $200,000 was apparently too high because they reposted the sales thread on Breach Forums a month later, with a headline that more clearly explained the data was stolen from <strong>Verizon</strong>&#8216;s &#8220;push-to-talk&#8221; (PTT) customers &#8212; primarily U.S. government agencies and first responders.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.404media.co/hackers-advertise-stolen-verizon-push-to-talk-call-logs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">404Media reported recently</a> that the breach does not appear to impact the main consumer Verizon network. Rather, the hackers broke into a third party provider and stole data on Verizon&#8217;s PTT systems, which are a separate product marketed towards public sector agencies, enterprises, and small businesses to communicate internally.</p>\n<h2>INTERVIEW WITH JUDISCHE</h2>\n<p>Investigators say Moucka shared a home in Kitchener with other tenants, but not his family. His mother was born in Chechnya, and he speaks Russian in addition to French and English. Moucka&#8217;s father died of a drug overdose at age 26, when the defendant was roughly five years old.</p>\n<p>A person claiming to be Judische began communicating with this author more than three months ago on Signal after KrebsOnSecurity started asking around about hacker nicknames previously used by Judische over the years.</p>\n<p>Judische admitted to stealing and ransoming data from Snowflake customers, but he said he&#8217;s not interested in selling the information, and that others have done this with some of the data sets he stole.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not really someone that sells data unless it&#8217;s crypto [databases] or credit cards because they&#8217;re the only thing I can find buyers for that actually have money for the data,&#8221; Judische told KrebsOnSecurity. &#8220;The rest is just ransom.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Judische has sent this reporter dozens of unsolicited and often profane messages from several different Signal accounts, all of which claimed to be an anonymous tipster sharing different identifying details for Judische. This appears to have been an elaborate effort by Judische to &#8220;detrace&#8221; his movements online and muddy the waters about his identity.</p>\n<p>Judische frequently claimed he had unparalleled &#8220;<strong>opsec</strong>&#8221; or <strong>operational security</strong>, a term that refers to the ability to compartmentalize and obfuscate one&#8217;s tracks online. In an effort to show he was one step ahead of investigators, Judische shared information indicating someone had given him a Mandiant researcher&#8217;s assessment of who and where they thought he was. Mandiant says those were discussion points shared with select reporters in advance of the researcher&#8217;s recent talk at the <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/press/announcing-labscon-2024-the-ultimate-cybersecurity-research-conference/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LabsCon security conference</a>.</p>\n<p>But in a conversation with KrebsOnSecurity on October 26, Judische acknowledged it was likely that the authorities were closing in on him, and said he would seriously answer certain questions about his personal life.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re coming after me for sure,&#8221; he said.<span id=\"more-67735\"></span></p>\n<p>In several previous conversations, Judische referenced suffering from an unspecified personality disorder, and when pressed said he has a condition called &#8220;schizotypal personality disorder&#8221; (STPD).</p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23061-schizotypal-personality-disorder#:~:text=Schizotypal%20personality%20disorder%20(STPD)%20is,to%20form%20and%20maintain%20relationships.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cleveland Clinic</a>, schizotypal personality disorder is marked by a consistent pattern of intense discomfort with relationships and social interactions: &#8220;People with STPD have unusual thoughts, speech and behaviors, which usually hinder their ability to form and maintain relationships.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Judische said he was prescribed medication for his psychological issues, but that he doesn&#8217;t take his meds. Which might explain why he never leaves his home.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I never go outside,&#8221; Judische allowed. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never had a friend or true relationship not online nor in person. I see people as vehicles to achieve my ends no matter how friendly I may seem on the surface, which you can see by how fast I discard people who are loyal or [that] I&#8217;ve known a long time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Judische later admitted he doesn&#8217;t have an official STPD diagnosis from a physician, but said he knows that he exhibits all the signs of someone with this condition.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t actually get diagnosed with that either,&#8221; Judische shared. &#8220;Most countries put you on lists and restrict you from certain things if you have it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Asked whether he has always lived at his current residence, Judische replied that he had to leave his hometown for his own safety.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t live safely where I&#8217;m from without getting robbed or arrested,&#8221; he said, without offering more details.</p>\n<p>A source familiar with the investigation said Moucka previously lived in Quebec, which he allegedly fled after being charged with harassing others on the social network <strong>Discord</strong>.</p>\n<p>Judische claims to have made at least $4 million in his Snowflake extortions. Judische said he and others frequently targeted business process outsourcing (BPO) companies, staffing firms that handle customer service for a wide range of organizations. They also went after managed service providers (MSPs) that oversee IT support and security for multiple companies, he claimed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Snowflake isn&#8217;t even the biggest BPO/MSP multi-company dataset on our networks, but what&#8217;s been exfiltrated from them is well over 100TB,&#8221; Judische bragged. &#8220;Only ones that don&#8217;t pay get disclosed (unless they disclose it themselves).

                "content:encodedSnippet": "A 25-year-old man in Ontario, Canada has been arrested for allegedly stealing data from and extorting more than 160 companies that used the cloud data service Snowflake.\n\nImage: https://www.pomerium.com/blog/the-real-lessons-from-the-snowflake-breach\n\nOn October 30, Canadian authorities arrested Alexander Moucka, a.k.a. Connor Riley Moucka of Kitchener, Ontario, on a provisional arrest warrant from the United States. Bloomberg first reported Moucka\u2019s alleged ties to the Snowflake hacks on Monday.\nAt the end of 2023, malicious hackers learned that many large companies had uploaded huge volumes of sensitive customer data to Snowflake accounts that were protected with little more than a username and password (no multi-factor authentication required). After scouring darknet markets for stolen Snowflake account credentials, the hackers began raiding the data storage repositories used by some of the world\u2019s largest corporations.\nAmong those was AT&T, which\u00a0disclosed in July that cybercriminals had stolen personal information and phone and text message records for roughly 110 million people \u2014 nearly all of its customers. Wired.com reported in July that AT&T paid a hacker $370,000 to delete stolen phone records.\nA report on the extortion attacks from the incident response firm Mandiant notes that Snowflake victim companies were privately approached by the hackers, who demanded a ransom in exchange for a promise not to sell or leak the stolen data. All told, more than 160 Snowflake customers were relieved of data, including TicketMaster,\u00a0Lending Tree,\u00a0Advance Auto Parts\u00a0and\u00a0Neiman Marcus.\nMoucka is alleged to have used the hacker handles Judische and Waifu, among many others. These monikers correspond to a prolific cybercriminal whose exploits were the subject of a recent story published here about the overlap between Western, English-speaking cybercriminals and extremist groups that harass and extort minors into harming themselves or others.\nOn May 2, 2024, Judische claimed on the fraud-focused Telegram channel Star Chat that they had hacked Santander Bank, one of the first known Snowflake victims. Judische would repeat that claim in Star Chat on May 13 \u2014 the day before Santander publicly disclosed a data breach \u2014 and would periodically blurt out the names of other Snowflake victims before their data even went up for sale on the cybercrime forums.\n404 Media reports that at a court hearing in Ontario this morning, Moucka called in from a prison phone and said he was seeking legal aid to hire an attorney.\nTELECOM DOMINOES\nMandiant has attributed the Snowflake compromises to a group it calls \u201cUNC5537,\u201d with members based in North America and\u00a0Turkey. Sources close to the investigation tell KrebsOnSecurity the UNC5537 member in Turkey is John Erin Binns, an elusive American man indicted by the\u00a0U.S. Department of Justice\u00a0(DOJ) for\u00a0a 2021 breach at T-Mobile that exposed the personal information of at least 76.6 million customers.\nUpdate: The Justice Department has unsealed an indictment (PDF) against Moucka and Binns, charging them with one count of conspiracy; 10 counts of wire fraud; four counts of computer fraud and abuse; two counts of extortion in relation to computer fraud; and two counts aggravated identity theft.\nIn a statement on Moucka\u2019s arrest, Mandiant said UNC5537 aka Alexander \u2018Connor\u2019 Moucka has proven to be one of the most consequential threat actors of 2024.\n\u201cIn April 2024, UNC5537 launched a campaign, systematically compromising misconfigured SaaS instances across over a hundred organizations,\u201d wrote Austin Larsen, Mandiant\u2019s senior threat analyst. \u201cThe operation, which left organizations reeling from significant data loss and extortion attempts, highlighted the alarming scale of harm an individual can cause using off-the-shelf tools.\u201d\nSources involved in the investigation said UNC5537 has focused on hacking into telecommunications companies around the world. Those sources told KrebsOnSecurity that Binns and Judische are suspected of stealing data from India\u2019s largest state-run telecommunications firm Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BNSL), and that the duo even bragged about being able to intercept or divert phone calls and text messages for a large portion of the population of India.\nJudische appears to have outsourced the sale of databases from victim companies who refuse to pay, delegating some of that work to a cybercriminal who uses the nickname Kiberphant0m on multiple forums. In late May 2024, Kiberphant0m began advertising the sale of hundreds of gigabytes of data stolen from BSNL.\n\u201cInformation is worth several million dollars but I\u2019m selling for pretty cheap,\u201d Kiberphant0m wrote of the BSNL data in a post on the English-language cybercrime community Breach Forums. \u201cNegotiate a deal in Telegram.\u201d\n\nAlso in May 2024, Kiberphant0m took to the Russian-language hacking forum XSS to sell more than 250 gigabytes of data stolen from an unnamed mobile telecom provider in Asia, including a database of all active customers and software allowing the sending of text messages to all customers.\nOn September 3, 2024, Kiberphant0m posted a sales thread on XSS titled \u201cSelling American Telecom Access (100B+ Revenue).\u201d Kiberphant0m\u2019s asking price of $200,000 was apparently too high because they reposted the sales thread on Breach Forums a month later, with a headline that more clearly explained the data was stolen from Verizon\u2018s \u201cpush-to-talk\u201d (PTT) customers \u2014 primarily U.S. government agencies and first responders.\n404Media reported recently that the breach does not appear to impact the main consumer Verizon network. Rather, the hackers broke into a third party provider and stole data on Verizon\u2019s PTT systems, which are a separate product marketed towards public sector agencies, enterprises, and small businesses to communicate internally.\nINTERVIEW WITH JUDISCHE\nInvestigators say Moucka shared a home in Kitchener with other tenants, but not his family. His mother was born in Chechnya, and he speaks Russian in addition to French and English. Moucka\u2019s father died of a drug overdose at age 26, when the defendant was roughly five years old.\nA person claiming to be Judische began communicating with this author more than three months ago on Signal after KrebsOnSecurity started asking around about hacker nicknames previously used by Judische over the years.\nJudische admitted to stealing and ransoming data from Snowflake customers, but he said he\u2019s not interested in selling the information, and that others have done this with some of the data sets he stole.\n\u201cI\u2019m not really someone that sells data unless it\u2019s crypto [databases] or credit cards because they\u2019re the only thing I can find buyers for that actually have money for the data,\u201d Judische told KrebsOnSecurity. \u201cThe rest is just ransom.\u201d\nJudische has sent this reporter dozens of unsolicited and often profane messages from several different Signal accounts, all of which claimed to be an anonymous tipster sharing different identifying details for Judische. This appears to have been an elaborate effort by Judische to \u201cdetrace\u201d his movements online and muddy the waters about his identity.\nJudische frequently claimed he had unparalleled \u201copsec\u201d or operational security, a term that refers to the ability to compartmentalize and obfuscate one\u2019s tracks online. In an effort to show he was one step ahead of investigators, Judische shared information indicating someone had given him a Mandiant researcher\u2019s assessment of who and where they thought he was. Mandiant says those were discussion points shared with select reporters in advance of the researcher\u2019s recent talk at the LabsCon security conference.\nBut in a conversation with KrebsOnSecurity on October 26, Judische acknowledged it was likely that the authorities were closing in on him, and said he would seriously answer certain questions about his personal life.\n\u201cThey\u2019re coming after me for sure,\u201d he said.\nIn several previous conversations, Judische referenced suffering from an unspecified personality disorder, and when pressed said he has a condition called \u201cschizotypal personality disorder\u201d (STPD).\nAccording to the Cleveland Clinic, schizotypal personality disorder is marked by a consistent pattern of intense discomfort with relationships and social interactions: \u201cPeople with STPD have unusual thoughts, speech and behaviors, which usually hinder their ability to form and maintain relationships.\u201d\nJudische said he was prescribed medication for his psychological issues, but that he doesn\u2019t take his meds. Which might explain why he never leaves his home.\n\u201cI never go outside,\u201d Judische allowed. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a friend or true relationship not online nor in person. I see people as vehicles to achieve my ends no matter how friendly I may seem on the surface, which you can see by how fast I discard people who are loyal or [that] I\u2019ve known a long time.\u201d\nJudische later admitted he doesn\u2019t have an official STPD diagnosis from a physician, but said he knows that he exhibits all the signs of someone with this condition.\n\u201cI can\u2019t actually get diagnosed with that either,\u201d Judische shared. \u201cMost countries put you on lists and restrict you from certain things if you have it.\u201d\nAsked whether he has always lived at his current residence, Judische replied that he had to leave his hometown for his own safety.\n\u201cI can\u2019t live safely where I\u2019m from without getting robbed or arrested,\u201d he said, without offering more details.\nA source familiar with the investigation said Moucka previously lived in Quebec, which he allegedly fled after being charged with harassing others on the social network Discord.\nJudische claims to have made at least $4 million in his Snowflake extortions. Judische said he and others frequently targeted business process outsourcing (BPO) companies, staffing firms that handle customer service for a wide range of organizations. They also went after managed service providers (MSPs) that oversee IT support and security for multiple companies, he claimed.\n\u201cSnowflake isn\u2019t even the biggest BPO/MSP multi-company dataset on our networks, but what\u2019s been exfiltrated from them is well over 100TB,\u201d Judische bragged. \u201cOnly ones that don\u2019t pay get disclosed (unless they disclose it themselves). A lot of them don\u2019t even do their SEC filing and just pay us to fuck off.\u201d\nINTEL SECRETS\nThe other half of UNC5537 \u2014 24-year-old John Erin Binns \u2014 was arrested in Turkey in late May 2024, and currently resides in a Turkish prison. However, it is unclear if Binns faces any immediate threat of extradition to the United States, where he is currently wanted on criminal hacking charges tied to the 2021 breach at T-Mobile.\nA person familiar with the investigation said Binns\u2019s application for Turkish citizenship was inexplicably approved after his incarceration, leading to speculation that Binns may have bought his way out of a sticky legal situation.\nUnder the Turkish constitution, a Turkish citizen cannot be extradited to a foreign state. Turkey has been criticized for its \u201cgolden passport\u201d program, which provides citizenship and sanctuary for anyone willing to pay several hundred thousand dollars.\n\nThis is an image of a passport that Binns shared in one of many unsolicited emails to KrebsOnSecurity since 2021. Binns never explained why he sent this in Feb. 2023.\n\nBinns\u2019s alleged hacker alter egos \u2014 \u201cIRDev\u201d and \u201cIntelSecrets\u201d \u2014 were at once feared and revered on several cybercrime-focused Telegram communities, because he was known to possess a powerful weapon: A massive botnet.

According to Binns, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) falsely told their counterparts in Turkey that he was a supporter or member of the Islamic State (ISIS), a claim he says led to his detention and torture by the Turkish authorities.\nHowever, in a 2020 lawsuit he filed against the CIA, Binns himself acknowledged having visited a previously ISIS-controlled area of Syria prior to moving to Turkey in 2017.\n\nA segment of a lawsuit Binns filed in 2020 against the CIA, in which he alleges U.S. put him on a terror watch list after he traveled to Syria in 2017.\n\nSources familiar with the investigation told KrebsOnSecurity that Binns was so paranoid about possible surveillance on him by American and Turkish intelligence agencies that his erratic behavior and online communications actually brought about the very government snooping that he feared.\nIn several online chats in late 2023 on Discord, IRDev lamented being lured into a law enforcement sting operation after trying to buy a rocket launcher online. A person close to the investigation confirmed that at the beginning of 2023, IRDev began making earnest inquiries about how to purchase a Stinger, an American-made portable weapon that operates as an infrared surface-to-air missile.\nSources told KrebsOnSecurity Binns\u2019 repeated efforts to purchase the projectile earned him multiple visits from the Turkish authorities, who were justifiably curious why he kept seeking to acquire such a powerful weapon.\nWAIFU\nA careful study of Judische\u2019s postings on Telegram and Discord since 2019 shows this user is more widely known under the nickname \u201cWaifu,\u201d a moniker that corresponds to one of the more accomplished \u201cSIM swappers\u201d in the English-language cybercrime community over the years.\nSIM swapping involves phishing, tricking or bribing mobile phone company employees for credentials needed to redirect a target\u2019s mobile phone number to a device the attackers control \u2014 allowing thieves to intercept incoming text messages and phone calls.\nSeveral SIM-swapping channels on Telegram maintain a frequently updated leaderboard of the 100 richest SIM-swappers, as well as the hacker handles associated with specific cybercrime groups (Waifu is ranked #24).

Judische said he prefers voice phishing or \u201cvishing\u201d attacks that result in the target installing data-stealing malware, as opposed to tricking the user into entering their username, password and one-time code.\n\u201cMost of my ops involve malware [because] credential access burns too fast,\u201d Judische explained.\nCRACKDOWN ON HARM GROUPS?\nThe Telegram channels that the Judische/Waifu accounts frequented over the years show this user divided their time between posting in channels dedicated to financial cybercrime, and harassing and stalking others in harm communities like Leak Society and Court.\nBoth of these Telegram communities are known for victimizing children through coordinated online campaigns of extortion, doxing, swatting and harassment. People affiliated with harm groups like Court and Leak Society will often recruit new members by lurking on gaming platforms, social media sites and mobile applications that are popular with young people, including Discord,\u00a0Minecraft,\u00a0Roblox,\u00a0Steam,\u00a0Telegram, and\u00a0Twitch.\n\u201cThis type of offence usually starts with a direct message through gaming platforms and can move to more private chatrooms on other virtual platforms, typically one with video enabled features, where the conversation quickly becomes sexualized or violent,\u201d warns a\u00a0recent alert\u00a0from the\u00a0Royal Canadian Mounted Police\u00a0(RCMP) about the rise of sextortion groups on social media channels.\n\u201cOne of the tactics being used by these actors is sextortion, however, they are not using it to extract money or for sexual gratification,\u201d the RCMP continued. \u201cInstead they use it to further manipulate and control victims to produce more harmful and violent content as part of their ideological objectives and radicalization pathway.\u201d\nSome of the largest such known groups include those that go by the names 764, CVLT, Kaskar, 7997,\u00a08884,\u00a02992,\u00a06996,\u00a0555,\u00a0Slit Town,\u00a0545,\u00a0404,\u00a0NMK,\u00a0303, and\u00a0H3ll.\nOn the various cybercrime-oriented channels Judische frequented, he often lied about his or others\u2019 involvement in various breaches. But Judische also at times shared nuggets of truth about his past, particularly when discussing the early history and membership of specific Telegram- and Discord-based cybercrime and harm groups.\nJudische claimed in multiple chats, including on Leak Society and Court, that they were an early member of the Atomwaffen Division (AWD), a white supremacy group whose members are suspected of having committed multiple murders in the U.S. since 2017.\nIn 2019, KrebsOnSecurity exposed how a loose-knit group of neo-Nazis, some of whom were affiliated with AWD, had doxed and/or swatted nearly three dozen journalists at a range of media publications. Swatting involves communicating a false police report of a bomb threat or hostage situation and tricking authorities into sending a heavily armed police response to a targeted address.\nJudsiche also told a fellow denizen of Court that years ago he was active in an older harm community called \u201cRapeLash,\u201d a truly vile Discord server known for attracting Atomwaffen members. A 2018 retrospective on RapeLash posted to the now defunct neo-Nazi forum Fascist Forge explains that RapeLash was awash in gory, violent images and child pornography.\nA Fascist Forge member named \u201cHuddy\u201d recalled that RapeLash was the third incarnation of an extremist community also known as \u201cFashWave,\u201d short for Fascist Wave.\n\u201cI have no real knowledge of what happened with the intermediary phase known as \u2018FashWave 2.0,\u2019 but FashWave 3.0 houses multiple known Satanists and other degenerates connected with AWD, one of which got arrested on possession of child pornography charges, last I heard,\u201d Huddy shared.\nIn June 2024, a Mandiant employee\u00a0told Bloomberg\u00a0that UNC5537 members have made death threats against cybersecurity experts investigating the hackers, and that in one case the group used artificial intelligence to create fake nude photos of a researcher to harass them.\nAllison Nixon is chief research officer with the New York-based cybersecurity firm Unit 221B. Nixon is among several researchers who have faced harassment and specific threats of physical violence from Judische.\nNixon said Judische is likely to argue in court that his self-described psychological disorder(s) should somehow excuse his long career in cybercrime and in harming others.\n\u201cThey ran a misinformation campaign in a sloppy attempt to cover up the hacking campaign,\u201d Nixon said of Judische. \u201cCoverups are an acknowledgment of guilt, which will undermine a mental illness defense in court. We expect that violent hackers from the [cybercrime community] will experience increasingly harsh sentences as the crackdown continues.\u201d\n5:34 p.m. ET: Updated story to include a clarification from Mandiant.

Connor Riley Moucka of Kitchener, Ontario, on a provisional arrest warrant from the United States.

Residents, local veterans, active members, and organizations celebrated with music, food, and fun while raising money to support the home with projects focused on wellness, vitality, and camaraderie.\nNov 8th, 2024 Veterans Day Event at AFRH\nOver the years, our Veterans Organization has consistently held annual pushup competitions for Mission 22, Wreaths Across America events & fundraising, participated in Run to Home Base, and much more! We talked to some of our employees involved in these events, and heres what they told us!\nHow did these events come to be?\nIn 2018, the Recorded Future Veterans Organization was founded by Jared Jalbert, Director, Strategy and Operations (Public Sector), and Lauren Mitchell, Account Executive (Intelligence Community).\nWe were two veterans dedicated to bringing other veterans together to celebrate with and care for each other. Our mission was created to empower veterans through volunteerism, education, cybersecurity support, and hiring programs. - Lauren.\nJared introduced Lauren to the home after he was brought in by one of his family members who volunteered there. Wreaths Across America was started by Jared who brings his family to participate in the event and pay homage to several family members and friends buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Participation in the Run to Home Base started after Lauren received services through the program and advocates for mental health awareness and care for our veterans.\nFuturists, Family, and Friends at Old Mission Cemetery in San Luis Obispo, CA in 2023\nWhat do you want to come out of these events/initiatives?\nThese events allow veterans of all ages, from WWII to those currently serving, to come together and reflect on the great honor and accomplishments of their time in service. They also provide every veterans family and friends an opportunity to be celebrated and thanked for their sacrifices to support their service members and the pride of being part of history. - Sean.\nEngagement, support, and awareness. Our Veterans have sacrificed so much. We need to ensure we are doing everything we can to support them. Additionally, bringing awareness to non-veterans about the struggles that veterans face. - Will.\nWill in San Diego, California in 2016\nWhy do these events matter?\nIt serves as a reminder of the selfless dedication, sacrifice, and sense of duty that military veterans of the United States Armed Forces and their families have demonstrated. During these events, I think about both my grandfathers service, but also about my sisters military career, still serving today. - Sean.\nFor me, it is a way to say Thank You and appreciate what service was like for other Veterans. We each serve differently, whether in a different era, branch, role, or situation. Being able to understand and appreciate other veterans' sacrifice and service is both humbling and eye-opening. - Will.\nVeterans sacrifice so much during their time in service, and post-military life can be a difficult and lonely transition.

Recent incidents, including break-ins at water treatment facilities in Finland and explosions at arms factories in Poland, highlight Russias use of gray zone tactics to undermine Western military, economic, and political capabilities without crossing the threshold of open conflict. Insikt Groups analysis identifies a pattern of Russian hybrid warfare involving covert operatives, agent networks, and plausible deniability tactics that echo Soviet-era sabotage strategies. With these tactics, <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/russia-seeks-exploit-western-war-fatigue-win-ukraine\">Russia aims to degrade NATOs capacity to support Ukraine</a>, increase internal tensions, and strain emergency resources.</p><h3 id=\"russian-sabotage-activities-escalate-amid-fraught-tensions\">Russian Sabotage Activities Escalate Amid Fraught Tensions</h3><p>As tensions between Russia and NATO remain high, Russia is very likely expanding its sabotage operations across Europe, with a focus on undermining NATOs support for Ukraine. These covert activities align with Russias broader hybrid warfare strategy, aiming to destabilize NATO countries, weaken their military capabilities, and strain political alliances. Recent incidents analyzed by Insikt Group reveal the calculated and persistent nature of Russian sabotage, using covert operatives, agent networks, and plausible deniability to avoid direct attribution.</p><h2 id=\"objectives\">Objectives</h2><p>Since <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/executive-overview-of-russian-aggression-against-ukraine\">Russias invasion of Ukraine in 2022</a>, European governments have increasingly reported suspected sabotage activities linked to Russia. This gray zone warfare includes operations that damage critical infrastructure without escalating to open conflict. Russia perceives itself as being in a passive phase of war with NATO countries due to their military support for Ukraine, thus justifying these low-profile but effective actions as part of a broader strategy to weaken adversaries.</p><h3 id=\"recent-incidents-of-sabotage\">Recent Incidents of Sabotage</h3><p>In June 2024, Insikt Group identified several incidents across six European countries bordering Russia that align with <a href=\"https://therecord.media/alarm-over-russia-sabotage-europe-spreads\">Russian sabotage tactics</a>:</p><ul><li><strong>Finland:</strong> Break-ins at water treatment facilities were reported, raising concerns about potential contamination and public safety risks. These breaches are indicative of economic sabotage targeting essential resources.</li><li><strong>Poland:</strong> Explosions at the Mesko arms factory and fires at the Broad Gauge Metallurgy Line transshipment terminal caused significant disruptions. Given the strategic importance of these facilities in supplying arms to Ukraine, these incidents are likely intended to hinder NATOs logistical support to Ukraine.</li><li><strong>Norway:</strong> Multiple arson attacks on vehicles and fires at critical transport hubs have disrupted infrastructure, increasing operational strain on local authorities.</li></ul><p>These incidents exemplify Russias likely objectives: to degrade NATO&#39;s operational readiness, overwhelm emergency response systems, and create an atmosphere of insecurity among European populations.</p><h3 id=\"russian-sabotage-tactics\">Russian Sabotage Tactics</h3><p>Russian sabotage activities rely on techniques that ensure plausible deniability. Intelligence networks recruit agents, often disaffected individuals or groups, who can execute these operations without drawing direct links to the Russian state. For example, covert operatives may infiltrate target nations under civilian covers, such as tourists or diplomats, or recruit local agents to avoid suspicion.</p><p>Russian sabotage tactics can be categorized into three groups:</p><ul><li><strong>Economic sabotage</strong>: Targeting infrastructure essential to economic stability, such as water treatment facilities and supply chains</li><li><strong>Military sabotage</strong>: Disrupting arms production, transportation, and military readiness through attacks on weapons factories or logistics hubs</li><li><strong>Political destabilization</strong>: Amplifying socio-political divisions and instilling fear within local populations by creating a persistent threat of sabotage</li></ul><h3 id=\"legacy-of-soviet-era-sabotage-strategies\">Legacy of Soviet-Era Sabotage Strategies</h3><p>Russian sabotage objectives today are largely consistent with Soviet-era strategies, as detailed by defector accounts and declassified documents. The Soviet Union frequently deployed covert operatives to weaken adversaries before and during conflicts.

                "content:encodedSnippet": "Summary\nRussia is likely ramping up its sabotage operations across Europe, targeting critical infrastructure to destabilize NATO allies and disrupt their support for Ukraine. Recent incidents, including break-ins at water treatment facilities in Finland and explosions at arms factories in Poland, highlight Russias use of gray zone tactics to undermine Western military, economic, and political capabilities without crossing the threshold of open conflict. Insikt Groups analysis identifies a pattern of Russian hybrid warfare involving covert operatives, agent networks, and plausible deniability tactics that echo Soviet-era sabotage strategies. With these tactics, Russia aims to degrade NATOs capacity to support Ukraine, increase internal tensions, and strain emergency resources.\nRussian Sabotage Activities Escalate Amid Fraught Tensions\nAs tensions between Russia and NATO remain high, Russia is very likely expanding its sabotage operations across Europe, with a focus on undermining NATOs support for Ukraine. These covert activities align with Russias broader hybrid warfare strategy, aiming to destabilize NATO countries, weaken their military capabilities, and strain political alliances. Recent incidents analyzed by Insikt Group reveal the calculated and persistent nature of Russian sabotage, using covert operatives, agent networks, and plausible deniability to avoid direct attribution.\nObjectives\nSince Russias invasion of Ukraine in 2022, European governments have increasingly reported suspected sabotage activities linked to Russia. This gray zone warfare includes operations that damage critical infrastructure without escalating to open conflict. Russia perceives itself as being in a passive phase of war with NATO countries due to their military support for Ukraine, thus justifying these low-profile but effective actions as part of a broader strategy to weaken adversaries.\nRecent Incidents of Sabotage\nIn June 2024, Insikt Group identified several incidents across six European countries bordering Russia that align with Russian sabotage tactics:\n\nFinland: Break-ins at water treatment facilities were reported, raising concerns about potential contamination and public safety risks. These breaches are indicative of economic sabotage targeting essential resources.\nPoland: Explosions at the Mesko arms factory and fires at the Broad Gauge Metallurgy Line transshipment terminal caused significant disruptions. Given the strategic importance of these facilities in supplying arms to Ukraine, these incidents are likely intended to hinder NATOs logistical support to Ukraine.\nNorway: Multiple arson attacks on vehicles and fires at critical transport hubs have disrupted infrastructure, increasing operational strain on local authorities.\n\nThese incidents exemplify Russias likely objectives: to degrade NATO's operational readiness, overwhelm emergency response systems, and create an atmosphere of insecurity among European populations.\nRussian Sabotage Tactics\nRussian sabotage activities rely on techniques that ensure plausible deniability. Intelligence networks recruit agents, often disaffected individuals or groups, who can execute these operations without drawing direct links to the Russian state. For example, covert operatives may infiltrate target nations under civilian covers, such as tourists or diplomats, or recruit local agents to avoid suspicion.\nRussian sabotage tactics can be categorized into three groups:\n\nEconomic sabotage: Targeting infrastructure essential to economic stability, such as water treatment facilities and supply chains\nMilitary sabotage: Disrupting arms production, transportation, and military readiness through attacks on weapons factories or logistics hubs\nPolitical destabilization: Amplifying socio-political divisions and instilling fear within local populations by creating a persistent threat of sabotage\n\nLegacy of Soviet-Era Sabotage Strategies\nRussian sabotage objectives today are largely consistent with Soviet-era strategies, as detailed by defector accounts and declassified documents. The Soviet Union frequently deployed covert operatives to weaken adversaries before and during conflicts. Today, Russian operatives continue to use cover identities, recruit agents, and employ rudimentary means (like arson or improvised explosives) to maintain plausible deniability. This continuity highlights the enduring influence of Soviet military doctrines in Russias current approach to hybrid warfare.\nMitigations\nTo counter the growing threat of Russian sabotage, NATO and its member states should strengthen infrastructure security and improve intelligence-sharing mechanisms across borders. Key steps include:\n\nUse Recorded Future Intelligence Clouds Facility Risk feature to monitor notable events occurring in close proximity to critical infrastructure facilities.\nUse the Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud to track potential Russian sabotage events and monitor commonly used tactics.\nEnhance national and local counterintelligence, surveillance, and physical security monitoring measures around critical infrastructure, such as those identified in previously documented Russian sabotage operations.\nIncrease cooperation and intelligence-sharing among European nations on Russian sabotage activities and collaborate on identifying transnational Russian agent networks.\nMonitor for signs of escalating Russian hybrid activities, such as sudden upticks in unexplained accidents or environmental incidents, and communicate risks to relevant businesses and industries.\n\nOutlook\nRussias sabotage activities are unlikely to wane as tensions with NATO continue. As hybrid warfare evolves, so too will Russian tactics, with an increased emphasis on leveraging emerging technologies and maintaining deniability. The stakes for European security are high; Russian sabotage has the potential to not only disrupt essential services but also create political instability and weaken public trust in governments ability to protect their citizens.\nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.",

In a recent investigation, Recorded Futures Insikt Group discovered a Chinese state-sponsored threat actor group, designated TAG-112, responsible for compromising Tibetan community websites and delivering Cobalt Strike, a potent cyber-espionage tool.</p><h2 id=\"key-findings\">Key Findings</h2><p>In late May 2024, TAG-112 compromised at least two Tibetan community websites: Tibet Post (tibetpost[.]net) and Gyudmed Tantric University (gyudmedtantricuniversity[.]org). The attackers exploited vulnerabilities in the Joomla content management system (CMS) used by these sites to implant malicious JavaScript. This JavaScript prompted visitors to download a fake security certificate, which, when opened, deployed the Cobalt Strike payload.</p><p>TAG-112s infrastructure shows notable overlap with TAG-102 (<a href=\"https://therecord.media/china-based-hackers-evasive-isps-malware\">Evasive Panda</a>), a more sophisticated Chinese state-sponsored group known for targeting Tibetan entities. However, Insikt Group has identified TAG-112 as a separate entity due to differences in attack maturity and tactics, such as using Cobalt Strike rather than custom malware and foregoing JavaScript obfuscation.</p><h3 id=\"malicious-javascript-and-spoofed-tls-error\">Malicious JavaScript and Spoofed TLS Error</h3><p>The attack begins with the malicious JavaScript embedded in the compromised websites. When a user visits one of these sites, the script detects the operating system and browser type, confirming compatibility with Windows. If compatible, the script initiates a connection with TAG-112s command-and-control (C2) domain, update[.]maskrisks[.]com, which then returns an HTML page spoofing a legitimate TLS certificate error.</p><p>This spoofed error page is crafted to mimic Google Chromes TLS certificate warning, deceiving users into clicking a link to &quot;download a security certificate.&quot; Upon clicking, users unknowingly initiate the download of <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/detect-cobalt-strike-inside-look\">Cobalt Strike</a>, a legitimate tool commonly used by security testers but often exploited by attackers for remote access and command execution.</p><h3 id=\"exploiting-website-vulnerabilities\">Exploiting Website Vulnerabilities</h3><p>TAG-112 likely gained access to the compromised Tibetan websites through vulnerabilities in Joomla, a popular CMS. Websites built on Joomla are frequently targeted by attackers if they are not adequately maintained and updated.

The group used Cloudflare to shield its servers&#39; IP addresses, complicating efforts to trace the infrastructure back to its origin. Insikt Group identified multiple IP addresses linked to TAG-112s C2 servers, some active as early as March 2024. The primary domain, maskrisks[.]com, was registered in March 2024 through Namecheap, with subdomains such as mail[.]maskrisks[.]com and checkupdate[.]maskrisks[.]com added for further operational flexibility.</p><h3 id=\"tag-112s-use-of-cobalt-strike\">TAG-112s Use of Cobalt Strike</h3><p>Cobalt Strike is a commercial penetration testing tool that has become a favorite among threat actors due to its versatility and powerful capabilities for remote access, lateral movement, and command-and-control. Insikt Group identified six distinct Cobalt Strike Beacon samples linked to TAG-112, with their C2 communication directed to mail[.]maskrisks[.]com. This malware enables TAG-112 to monitor and control compromised systems, gathering intelligence and potentially leveraging these infected systems for further espionage activities.</p><h3 id=\"connections-to-tag-102-evasive-panda\">Connections to TAG-102 (Evasive Panda)</h3><p>TAG-112 shares several operational characteristics with TAG-102 (Evasive Panda), another <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/chinese-cyberespionage-operations\">Chinese APT known for targeting the Tibetan community</a>. Both groups have used similar methods, including spoofed error pages to deliver malicious files. However, TAG-112s operations are less sophisticated than TAG-102, indicating that it may be a subgroup or less experienced branch. For instance, while TAG-102 has deployed customized malware and used obfuscation techniques, TAG-112 relies on the readily available Cobalt Strike tool without obfuscating its JavaScript.</p><p>Despite the lack of obfuscation, TAG-112s tactics and overlaps with TAG-102 highlight the Chinese governments ongoing interest in Tibetan and other ethnic and religious minority communities. Such campaigns are part of a broader strategy of surveillance and control, targeting groups perceived as threats to the stability and control of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).</p><h3 id=\"mitigation-recommendations\">Mitigation Recommendations</h3><p>TAG-112s campaign underscores the importance of proactive cybersecurity measures, particularly for organizations that may be high-value targets for state-sponsored actors. Recorded Future recommends the following steps:</p><ol><li><strong>Intrusion Detection and Prevention</strong>: Configure intrusion detection (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to alert on any indicators of compromise (IoCs) associated with TAG-112.

The risks posed by these attacks are substantial, but public and private entities can take steps to mitigate them. \nOrganizations need to improve cybersecurity defenses, including monitoring for signs of psychological attacks. Collaboration between governments, private enterprises, and cybersecurity experts will be crucial in identifying and mitigating these threats. Exercises and simulations, such as red teaming, can help organizations test their readiness for potential attacks. Industry leaders must consider incorporating scenarios that mirror Russias SIAs to strengthen defenses and identify vulnerabilities.\nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.",

                "content:encoded": "<p>Globally, regulations and directives are significantly altering the way organizations address cyber resilience, emphasizing the necessity for a more proactive stance. This is evident in both the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) and the second version of the Network and Information Systems Directive (NIS2).</p><h2 id=\"what-is-dora\">What is DORA?</h2><p>DORA <a href=\"https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/digital-operational-resilience-act-dora_en\">establishes</a> technical standards for EU member states to adopt as it relates to covered entities and their critical third-party Information &amp; Communications Technology (ICT) providers across EU member states. ICT is considered to be so influential and essential to economic development and business growth that it has been credited with ushering in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. However, this reliance on ICT means that organizations must focus on digital resilience to minimize risk of not being able to deliver critical and important services. </p><h2 id=\"who-does-dora-apply-to\">Who Does DORA Apply To?</h2><p>The measures detailed by DORA will be applicable to both traditional and non-traditional financial entities operating in the EU and their ICT providers. ICT is broad and covers tools like cloud computing, software, hardware, transactions, communications, data, internet access, and more. </p><h2 id=\"why-is-dora-being-implemented\">Why is DORA Being Implemented?</h2><p>The increasing reliance on digital technologies in the financial sector has been heard loud and clear - thus DORA was proposed. DORA aims to make sure that financial institutions can withstand, respond to, and recover from ICT-related disruptions and threats. Ultimately the Act aims to elevate the operational resilience of financial entities, safeguard financial stability, and protect consumers from the adverse impacts of digital disruptions. </p><h2 id=\"impact-of-cyber-attacks-on-financial-sector\">Impact of Cyber Attacks on Financial Sector</h2><p>The financial sector saw a dramatic increase in Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, with a 154% rise from 2022 to 2023. In EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) the financial services sector accounted for 66% of all DDoS attacks, compared with 28% in North America. This surge in DDoS attacks against EMEA financial services institutions is likely due to geopolitical tensions and hacktivist activities related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, making the financial sector the most targeted by these types of attacks. (<a href=\"https://www.fsisac.com/newsroom/pr-akamai-ddos-report-2024\">FS ISAC</a>) </p><p>Though not specifically against the Financial Sector, the MOVEit transfer attack highlights the impact of ICT. In 2023, a ransomware group named CL0P exploited a zero-day vulnerability in MOVEit, a managed file transfer software. This attack affected multiple organizations, including financial institutions and healthcare providers. CL0Ps <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/2023-annual-report\">MOVEit campaign</a> garnered upwards of $100M in profit for the group, impacting over 2,750 organizations and 94 million individuals. It highlights the far-reaching impact software supply chain attacks can have.</p><h2 id=\"pillars-of-dora\">Pillars of DORA</h2><ul><li><strong>ICT Risk Management and Governance:</strong> DORA will seek to mandate that the managing body of an organization holds ultimate responsibility for overseeing ICT risk. It emphasizes the need for a well-documented ICT risk management framework to swiftly, efficiently, and comprehensively tackle both cyber and physical risks. </li><li><strong>Incident Response and Reporting:</strong> Organizations will be required to maintain documented systems for monitoring, managing, logging, classifying, and reporting ICT-related incidents. This ensures prompt and effective responses to any issues that arise. </li><li><strong>Digital Operational Resilience Testing:</strong> Financial institutions under DORA must regularly test their defenses and identify any vulnerabilities in their ICT systems. This proactive approach helps maintain robust protections against potential threats. </li><li><strong>Third-Party Risk Management:</strong> DORA seeks to impose  requirements not only for financial institutions, but also for their ICT providers. Critical ICT third-party service providers are often subject to oversight from relevant managing bodies. Financial firms should actively manage ICT third-party risks through contractual agreements and diligent oversight, ensuring a comprehensive risk management strategy to ensure compliance.</li></ul><h2 id=\"what-is-nis2\">What is NIS2?</h2><p>NIS2 aims to improve the cybersecurity capabilities across the EU by ensuring a high common level of cybersecurity across member states. NIS2 expands on the previous directive by addressing some gaps and shortcomings identified over the past few years.</p><h2 id=\"key-changes-introduced-by-nis2\">Key Changes Introduced by NIS2</h2><p>NIS2 introduces several significant changes aimed at enhancing cybersecurity measures and ensuring a more uniform implementation across the EU.

                "content:encodedSnippet": "Globally, regulations and directives are significantly altering the way organizations address cyber resilience, emphasizing the necessity for a more proactive stance. This is evident in both the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) and the second version of the Network and Information Systems Directive (NIS2).\nWhat is DORA?\nDORA establishes technical standards for EU member states to adopt as it relates to covered entities and their critical third-party Information & Communications Technology (ICT) providers across EU member states. ICT is considered to be so influential and essential to economic development and business growth that it has been credited with ushering in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. However, this reliance on ICT means that organizations must focus on digital resilience to minimize risk of not being able to deliver critical and important services. \nWho Does DORA Apply To?\nThe measures detailed by DORA will be applicable to both traditional and non-traditional financial entities operating in the EU and their ICT providers. ICT is broad and covers tools like cloud computing, software, hardware, transactions, communications, data, internet access, and more. \nWhy is DORA Being Implemented?\nThe increasing reliance on digital technologies in the financial sector has been heard loud and clear - thus DORA was proposed. DORA aims to make sure that financial institutions can withstand, respond to, and recover from ICT-related disruptions and threats. Ultimately the Act aims to elevate the operational resilience of financial entities, safeguard financial stability, and protect consumers from the adverse impacts of digital disruptions. \nImpact of Cyber Attacks on Financial Sector\nThe financial sector saw a dramatic increase in Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, with a 154% rise from 2022 to 2023. In EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) the financial services sector accounted for 66% of all DDoS attacks, compared with 28% in North America. This surge in DDoS attacks against EMEA financial services institutions is likely due to geopolitical tensions and hacktivist activities related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, making the financial sector the most targeted by these types of attacks. (FS ISAC) \nThough not specifically against the Financial Sector, the MOVEit transfer attack highlights the impact of ICT. In 2023, a ransomware group named CL0P exploited a zero-day vulnerability in MOVEit, a managed file transfer software. This attack affected multiple organizations, including financial institutions and healthcare providers. CL0Ps MOVEit campaign garnered upwards of $100M in profit for the group, impacting over 2,750 organizations and 94 million individuals. It highlights the far-reaching impact software supply chain attacks can have.\nPillars of DORA\n\nICT Risk Management and Governance: DORA will seek to mandate that the managing body of an organization holds ultimate responsibility for overseeing ICT risk. It emphasizes the need for a well-documented ICT risk management framework to swiftly, efficiently, and comprehensively tackle both cyber and physical risks. \nIncident Response and Reporting: Organizations will be required to maintain documented systems for monitoring, managing, logging, classifying, and reporting ICT-related incidents. This ensures prompt and effective responses to any issues that arise. \nDigital Operational Resilience Testing: Financial institutions under DORA must regularly test their defenses and identify any vulnerabilities in their ICT systems. This proactive approach helps maintain robust protections against potential threats. \nThird-Party Risk Management: DORA seeks to impose  requirements not only for financial institutions, but also for their ICT providers. Critical ICT third-party service providers are often subject to oversight from relevant managing bodies. Financial firms should actively manage ICT third-party risks through contractual agreements and diligent oversight, ensuring a comprehensive risk management strategy to ensure compliance.\n\nWhat is NIS2?\nNIS2 aims to improve the cybersecurity capabilities across the EU by ensuring a high common level of cybersecurity across member states. NIS2 expands on the previous directive by addressing some gaps and shortcomings identified over the past few years.\nKey Changes Introduced by NIS2\nNIS2 introduces several significant changes aimed at enhancing cybersecurity measures and ensuring a more uniform implementation across the EU. Some of the key changes include: \n\nBroader Scope: NIS2 extends its coverage to more sectors, including public administration, space, manufacturing of critical products, and food supply chains, reflecting the evolving landscape of digital threats. \nStricter Security Requirements: The directive sets higher standards for cybersecurity risk management measures, incident reporting, and supply chain security. Organizations may need to implement a range of technical and organizational measures to protect their networks and information systems. \nEnhanced Cooperation and Information Sharing:  NIS2 promotes greater cooperation between member states and encourages information sharing among public and private entities to improve the overall security posture.\nIncident Reporting: Organizations are required to report significant incidents to relevant authorities within 24 hours, ensuring a swift response to potential threats.\n\nAreas of Focus for Organizations\nBoth DORA and NIS2 highlight the importance of risk management, supply chain security, and development and maintenance of robust incident response plans. In order to adapt to these requirements, there are some key areas for businesses to focus on: \nImplementing both proactive and reactive processes towards mitigating risk\nImplementing both proactive and reactive processes towards mitigating risk is crucial for true cyber resilience. Proactive measures, such as regular risk assessments, vulnerability scans, and the deployment of security controls, enable organizations to anticipate and prevent potential threats before they materialize. This forward-thinking approach helps to fortify an organizations defenses, ensuring that they are resilient against emerging cyber threats. On the other hand, reactive processes, including incident response plans, real-time monitoring, and forensic investigations, can be essential for addressing and mitigating the impact of security incidents when they occur. \nFocusing on your third-party suppliers as a part of your organizations attack surface\nThird-party vendors are a critical component to todays modern business, helping to accelerate product deliveries, spur innovation, increase efficiency, and lower average costs. The average company shares confidential information with 583 parties, according to a Ponemon Institute study. Its no surprise why Gartner estimates that by 2025 nearly half of organizations worldwide will have experienced attacks on their software supply chains, a three-fold increase from 2021.  \nThe challenge is that more than 2/3 of organizations have a limited, ad hoc understanding, or none at all of their third and fourth party risk. \nTraditionally the primary mechanism for managing down cyber supply chain risk has been through preventative measures: due diligence reviews, lengthy questionnaires, and extensive back and forth communication. These efforts are a blanket approach that is cumbersome, lacks scalability, and is difficult to enforce. Prevention is always an admirable pursuit, but detection is critical, especially in an increasingly connected world.

These strict timelines mean a streamlined incident response process is critical, getting information into the hands of analysts as quickly as possible. \nUnder NIS2, organizations may be required to submit an early warning within 24 hours of any significant incident and a full notification report within 72 hours, which needs to include the assessment of the incident, severity and impact, and related IOCs. In this case, getting information into the hands of the analysts as quickly as possible is critical. \nHow Threat Intelligence Can Help\nGain a complete view of your threat landscape to identify what matters to you\n\nQuickly identify top threat actors of interest, especially targeting your third-parties\nDetermine most concerning malware based on your companys technologies\n\n\nImplement security controls and make adjustments as necessary\n\nUnderstand the technical parameters of malware used in threat actor campaigns to close specific ports\nUpdate block lists with continuously validated IP addresses and domains for command & control (C2), botnet and remote access trojan (RAT) infrastructure\nAutomatically reset passwords in an identity access management (IAM) system with recently stolen credentials\n\n\nMitigate software threats originating from 3rd and 4th party vendors\n\nEnrich vulnerabilities on scanned third-party products with data on weaponization\nDynamic risk scoring for third-parties, updated in real-time\n\n\nDetect new threats with context\n\nReceive a notification within minutes of a potential breach impacting a key third-party, such as a database offered for sale\nDetect references to your brand and secret keywords on ransomware extortion sites to quickly understand the severity of potential leaked documents\n\n\nDecrease time to respond and report\n\nEquip users with essential information, updated in real time, on their threat landscape\nReduce time spent searching, summarizing, and writing reports by hours \nRecorded Future AI answers your questions about threat patterns, implications, and intelligence sources\n\n\n\nA Cyber-Resilient Future\nRisk management, supply chain security, and incident response are pivotal components of DORA, each playing a crucial role in strengthening an organizations cybersecurity framework.

However, recent findings by Insikt Group reveal that Predator&#39;s infrastructure is back with modifications to evade detection and anonymize users. This resurgence highlights Predators ongoing use by customers in countries such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Angola. While Predator continues to pose significant privacy and security risks, especially to high-profile individuals like politicians and executives, new infrastructure changes make tracking users more difficult. Despite these efforts, defenders can mitigate risks by following cybersecurity best practices, including regular device updates, using lockdown mode, and deploying mobile device management systems. As spyware like Predator evolves, global efforts to regulate and curb its use remain crucial.</p><h2 id=\"predator-spyware-resurfaces-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-threat\">Predator Spyware Resurfaces: What You Need to Know About the Threat</h2><p>After Intellexa, the creators of the infamous Predator spyware, faced sanctions and exposure, a noticeable reduction in Predator activity was observed. However, according to recent analysis by the Insikt Group, Predator is far from disappearing. The spyware infrastructure has resurfaced, posing renewed risks to privacy and security. With its return, operators have implemented new methods to obscure their activities, complicating efforts to trace and attribute their attacks.</p><p><strong>The Resurgence of Predator Spyware Infrastructure</strong></p><p>In 2024, public reporting and US government sanctions led to a sharp decline in Predator spyware activity. At the time, it appeared that global political efforts aimed at curbing spyware abuse were making significant progress. However, Insikt Groups recent findings point to a re-emergence of Predators infrastructure. New infrastructure tied to Predator was detected in multiple countries, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Angola.</p><p>This sophisticated spyware, primarily used by government actors, allows operators to infiltrate devices, gaining access to sensitive data like messages and contacts and even activating cameras and microphones without the users knowledge. </p><p><strong>Changes in Infrastructure and Evasion Tactics</strong></p><p>Predator&#39;s operators have significantly enhanced their infrastructure, adding layers of complexity to evade detection. The new infrastructure includes an additional tier in its multi-tiered delivery system, which anonymizes customer operations, making it even harder to identify which countries are using the spyware. This change makes it more difficult for researchers and cybersecurity defenders to track the spread of Predator.</p><p>Despite these changes, the mode of operation remains largely the same. The spyware likely continues to use both one-click and zero-click attack vectors, exploiting browser vulnerabilities and network access to install itself on targeted devices. Even though there are no reports of fully remote zero-click attacks, like those associated with Pegasus, Predator remains a dangerous tool in the hands of those targeting high-profile individuals.</p><p><strong>High-Profile Targets Remain at Risk</strong></p><p>One of the most concerning aspects of Predators return is its likely continued targeting of high-profile individuals. Politicians, executives, journalists, and activists are at the highest risk due to the intelligence value they hold for governments or other malicious actors. The costly licensing of Predator further suggests that operators reserve its use for strategic, high-value targets.</p><p>This widespread use of mercenary spyware, particularly against political opposition, has sparked concern in regions like the European Union. Investigations in Greece and Poland have already revealed how spyware has been used against opposition figures and journalists, raising serious questions about the legality and ethics of such surveillance.</p><p><strong>Best Practices for Defense</strong></p><p>Given Predator&#39;s renewed presence and the sophistication of its infrastructure, individuals and organizations must stay vigilant. Insikt Group has outlined several defensive measures that can help mitigate the risk of Predator spyware infiltration:</p><ol><li><strong>Regular Software Updates </strong> Keeping devices up to date with the latest security patches is crucial for reducing vulnerabilities that spyware like Predator exploits.</li><li><strong>Device Reboots </strong> Periodically rebooting devices can disrupt spyware operations, though it may not completely eliminate advanced spyware.</li><li><strong>Lockdown Mode </strong> Activating lockdown mode on devices can help block unauthorized access and exploitation attempts.</li><li><strong>Mobile Device Management (MDM) </strong> Implementing MDM systems allows organizations to manage and secure employee devices, ensuring they adhere to security protocols.</li><li><strong>Security Awareness Training </strong> Educating employees about spearphishing and other social engineering tactics can reduce the likelihood of falling victim to spyware attacks.</li></ol><p>These measures are particularly important for individuals in sensitive roles, such as those working in government, civil society, or corporate leadership positions.</p><p><strong>The Future of Spyware and Global Regulations</strong></p><p>Despite efforts to curb the use of spyware, the market for mercenary spyware is expected to grow. As demand for surveillance tools continues, more companies will likely emerge, developing new products and finding ways to bypass security defenses. The profitability of spyware and the competition within the industry make it likely that we will see even more sophisticated tools in the future.</p><p>In response to these threats, global efforts to regulate spyware continue. Investigations like those underway in the European Union may lead to stricter regulations on spyware sales and use. However, until significant international action is taken, Predator and similar tools will remain a persistent threat.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>The re-emergence of Predator spyware is a stark reminder of the growing dangers posed by mercenary spyware.

                "content:encodedSnippet": "Following exposure and sanctions by the US government, Intellexas Predator spyware activity appeared to decline. However, recent findings by Insikt Group reveal that Predator's infrastructure is back with modifications to evade detection and anonymize users. This resurgence highlights Predators ongoing use by customers in countries such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Angola. While Predator continues to pose significant privacy and security risks, especially to high-profile individuals like politicians and executives, new infrastructure changes make tracking users more difficult. Despite these efforts, defenders can mitigate risks by following cybersecurity best practices, including regular device updates, using lockdown mode, and deploying mobile device management systems. As spyware like Predator evolves, global efforts to regulate and curb its use remain crucial.\nPredator Spyware Resurfaces: What You Need to Know About the Threat\nAfter Intellexa, the creators of the infamous Predator spyware, faced sanctions and exposure, a noticeable reduction in Predator activity was observed. However, according to recent analysis by the Insikt Group, Predator is far from disappearing. The spyware infrastructure has resurfaced, posing renewed risks to privacy and security. With its return, operators have implemented new methods to obscure their activities, complicating efforts to trace and attribute their attacks.\nThe Resurgence of Predator Spyware Infrastructure\nIn 2024, public reporting and US government sanctions led to a sharp decline in Predator spyware activity. At the time, it appeared that global political efforts aimed at curbing spyware abuse were making significant progress. However, Insikt Groups recent findings point to a re-emergence of Predators infrastructure. New infrastructure tied to Predator was detected in multiple countries, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Angola.\nThis sophisticated spyware, primarily used by government actors, allows operators to infiltrate devices, gaining access to sensitive data like messages and contacts and even activating cameras and microphones without the users knowledge. \nChanges in Infrastructure and Evasion Tactics\nPredator's operators have significantly enhanced their infrastructure, adding layers of complexity to evade detection. The new infrastructure includes an additional tier in its multi-tiered delivery system, which anonymizes customer operations, making it even harder to identify which countries are using the spyware. This change makes it more difficult for researchers and cybersecurity defenders to track the spread of Predator.\nDespite these changes, the mode of operation remains largely the same. The spyware likely continues to use both one-click and zero-click attack vectors, exploiting browser vulnerabilities and network access to install itself on targeted devices. Even though there are no reports of fully remote zero-click attacks, like those associated with Pegasus, Predator remains a dangerous tool in the hands of those targeting high-profile individuals.\nHigh-Profile Targets Remain at Risk\nOne of the most concerning aspects of Predators return is its likely continued targeting of high-profile individuals. Politicians, executives, journalists, and activists are at the highest risk due to the intelligence value they hold for governments or other malicious actors. The costly licensing of Predator further suggests that operators reserve its use for strategic, high-value targets.\nThis widespread use of mercenary spyware, particularly against political opposition, has sparked concern in regions like the European Union. Investigations in Greece and Poland have already revealed how spyware has been used against opposition figures and journalists, raising serious questions about the legality and ethics of such surveillance.\nBest Practices for Defense\nGiven Predator's renewed presence and the sophistication of its infrastructure, individuals and organizations must stay vigilant. Insikt Group has outlined several defensive measures that can help mitigate the risk of Predator spyware infiltration:\n\nRegular Software Updates  Keeping devices up to date with the latest security patches is crucial for reducing vulnerabilities that spyware like Predator exploits.\nDevice Reboots  Periodically rebooting devices can disrupt spyware operations, though it may not completely eliminate advanced spyware.\nLockdown Mode  Activating lockdown mode on devices can help block unauthorized access and exploitation attempts.\nMobile Device Management (MDM)  Implementing MDM systems allows organizations to manage and secure employee devices, ensuring they adhere to security protocols.\nSecurity Awareness Training  Educating employees about spearphishing and other social engineering tactics can reduce the likelihood of falling victim to spyware attacks.\n\nThese measures are particularly important for individuals in sensitive roles, such as those working in government, civil society, or corporate leadership positions.\nThe Future of Spyware and Global Regulations\nDespite efforts to curb the use of spyware, the market for mercenary spyware is expected to grow. As demand for surveillance tools continues, more companies will likely emerge, developing new products and finding ways to bypass security defenses. The profitability of spyware and the competition within the industry make it likely that we will see even more sophisticated tools in the future.\nIn response to these threats, global efforts to regulate spyware continue. Investigations like those underway in the European Union may lead to stricter regulations on spyware sales and use. However, until significant international action is taken, Predator and similar tools will remain a persistent threat.\nConclusion\nThe re-emergence of Predator spyware is a stark reminder of the growing dangers posed by mercenary spyware. While initial sanctions and public exposure seemed to have diminished its presence, recent developments show that Predator is still very much active. Its infrastructure has evolved, making it harder to track and identify users, but with the right cybersecurity practices in place, individuals and organizations can reduce their risk of becoming targets.\nAs the spyware market continues to expand, it is essential for governments and cybersecurity professionals to stay ahead of these threats. Public reporting, ongoing research, and stronger regulations are critical in minimizing the damage caused by tools like Predator.\nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.\nAppendix A  Indicators of Compromise\n\nDomains:\nhappytotstoys[.]com\nholidaypriceguide[.]com\nlesautreseux[.]com\nmasoloyakati[.]com\nnoisyball[.]com\nnyirangongovrai[.]com\ntoysfourtots[.]com\nyokananu[.]net\n\nIP Addresses:\n169.239.129[.]76\n185.123.102[.]40\n185.235.137[.]6\n185.243.113[.]169\n185.243.113[.]169\n193.29.56[.]252\n193.29.59[.]164\n45.86.163[.]178\n98.142.253[.]18\n\n\n\n\nAppendix B  Mitre ATT&CK Techniques\n  \n   Tactic: Technique   ATT&CK Code  \n  \n   Resource Development: Acquire Infrastructure: Domains   T1583.001  \n    \n   Resource Development: Acquire Infrastructure: Virtual Private Server   T1583.003  \n    \n   Resource Development: Acquire Infrastructure: Server   T1583.004  \n    \n   Initial Access: Spearphishing Link   T1566.002",

                "content:encodedSnippet": "Insikt Group has identified a significant increase in cyber threat activity from GreenCharlie, an Iran-nexus group that overlaps with  Mint Sandstorm, Charming Kitten, and APT42. Targeting US political and government entities, GreenCharlie utilizes sophisticated phishing operations and malware like GORBLE and POWERSTAR. The group's infrastructure, which includes domains registered with dynamic DNS (DDNS) providers, enables the groups phishing attacks.\nGreenCharlies Persistent Threat\nSince June 2024, Insikt Group has tracked infrastructure linked to GreenCharlie, an Iran-nexus cyber threat group with connections to Mint Sandstorm, Charming Kitten, and APT42. Insikt Group analysis linked GreenCharlie infrastructure to malware which is reported to have been used to target US political campaign officials, government entities, and strategic assets. \nGreenCharlie is associated with malware, including POWERSTAR (also known as CharmPower and GorjolEcho) and GORBLE, the latter of which was identified by Google-Mandiant. Both GORBLE and POWERSTAR are variants of the same malware family, designed to enable espionage activity via spearphishing campaigns. \nIran and its associated cyber-espionage actors have consistently demonstrated both the intent and capability to engage in influence and interference operations targeting US elections and domestic information spaces. These campaigns are likely to continue utilizing hack-and-leak tactics aimed at undermining or supporting political candidates, influencing voter behavior, and fostering discord.\nThe groups infrastructure is meticulously crafted, utilizing dynamic DNS (DDNS) providers like Dynu, DNSEXIT, and Vitalwerks to register domains used in phishing attacks. These domains often employ deceptive themes related to cloud services, file sharing, and document visualization to lure targets into revealing sensitive information or downloading malicious files.\nRecorded Futures Network Intelligence has identified multiple Iran-based IP addresses communicating with GreenCharlies infrastructure. The use of ProtonVPN and ProtonMail further indicates an attempt to obfuscate the groups activities, a common tactic among Iranian APTs.\nGreenCharlies phishing operations are highly targeted, often employing social engineering techniques that exploit current events and political tensions. The group has registered numerous domains since May 2024, many of which are likely used for phishing activities. These domains are linked to DDNS providers, which allow for rapid changes in IP addresses, making it difficult to track the groups activities.\nThe malware deployed by GreenCharlie, including GORBLE and POWERSTAR, follows a multi-stage infection process. After initial access through phishing, the malware establishes communication with command-and-control (C2) servers, enabling the attackers to exfiltrate data or deliver additional payloads.\nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.\nAppendix A  Indicators of Compromise\n\nDomains:\nactiveeditor[.]info\npersonalwebview[.]info\nlonglivefreedom.ddns[.]net\nhugmefirstddd.ddns[.]net\nicenotebook.ddns[.]net\nsoftservicetel.ddns[.]net\nconfigtools.linkpc[.]net\nwebviewerpage[.]info\nwww.selfpackage[.]info\nselfpackage[.]info\nitemselectionmode[.]info\ntermsstatement.duckdns[.]org\nmobiletoolssdk.dns-dynamic[.]net\nresearchdocument[.]info\ntimelinepage.dns-dynamic[.]net\nsearchstatistics.duckdns[.]org\nmessagepending[.]info\nwww.chatsynctransfer[.]info\nsynctimezone.dns-dynamic[.]net\nchatsynctransfer[.]info\ntimezone-update.duckdns[.]org\nonetimestorage[.]info\ntowerreseller.dns-dynamic[.]net\ntranslatorupdater.dns-dynamic[.]net\napi.overall-continuing[.]site\nbackend.cheap-case[.]site\nadmin.cheap-case[.]site\ndemo.cheap-case[.]site\ndev.cheap-case[.]site\napp.cheap-case[.]site\napi.cheap-case[.]site\neditioncloudfiles.dns-dynamic[.]net\nfileeditiontools.linkpc[.]net\nentryconfirmation.duckdns[.]org\ndoceditor.duckdns[.]orgv\nprojectdrivevirtualcloud.co[.]uk\ncontinueresource.forumz[.]info\ndestinationzone.duia[.]eu\nonlinecloudzone[.]info\nstorageprovider.duia[.]eu\nlineeditor.32-b[.]it\nlineeditor.001www[.]com\nlineeditor.mypi[.]co\ndynamicrender.line[.]pm\nnextcloudzone.dns-dynamic[.]net\nrealpage.redirectme[.]net\nsharestoredocs.theworkpc[.]com\nthisismyapp.accesscam[.]org\nthisismydomain.chickenkiller[.]com\npagerendercloud.linkpc[.]net\nsplitviewer.linkpc[.]net\npageviewer.linkpc[.]net\npreparingdestination.fixip[.]org\njoincloud.mypi[.]co\njoincloud.duckdns[.]org\nrealcloud[.]info\ndirectfileinternal[.]info\nsourceusedirection.mypi[.]co\nviewdestination.vpndns[.]net\noverflow.duia[.]eu\ntracedestination.duia[.]eu\ncontinue.duia[.]eu\nlinereview.duia[.]eu\nhighlightsreview.line.pm\nnextcloud.duia[.]us\nsmartview.dns-dynamic.net\ncontentpreview.redirectme[.]net\nfinaledition.redirectme[.]net\ndynamictranslator.ddnsgeek[.]com\npersonalstoragebox.linkpc[.]net\npersonalcloudparent[.]info\ncloudarchive[.]info\ncloudregionpages[.]info\nstreaml23.duia[.]eu\npkglessplans[.]xyz\nworldstate.duia[.]us\ncallfeedback.duia[.]ro\nreviewedition.duia[.]eu\nfilereader.dns-dynamic[.]net\nvector.kozow[.]com\ncloudtools.duia[.]eu\nuptimezonemetadta.run[.]place\ndocumentcloudeditor.ddnsgeek[.]com\ncoldwarehexahash.dns-dynamic[.]net\nreadquickarticle.dns-dynamic[.]net\nuptime-timezone.dns-dynamic[.]net\nIP Addresses:\n185.241.61[.]86\n172.86.77[.]85\n146.70.95[.]251\n91.232.105[.]185\n54.39.143[.]112\n38.180.91[.]213\n38.180.123[.]135\n38.180.123[.]113\n38.180.123[.]187\n38.180.146[.]214\n38.180.146[.]212\n38.180.146[.]194\n38.180.146[.]174\n38.180.123[.]231\n38.180.123[.]234\n38.180.146[.]252\n37.1.194[.]250\nIran-based IP Addresses:\n193.111.236[.]130\n185.143.233[.]120\n94.74.175[.]209 \n94.74.145[.]184 \n93.119.48[.]60\n37.148.63[.]24\n37.255.251[.]17 \n5.106.153[.]245\n5.106.169[.]235 \n5.106.185[.]98 \n5.106.202[.]101 \n5.106.219[.]243\nMalware Hash:\nC3486133783379e13ed37c45dc6645cbee4c1c6e62e7988722931eef99c8eaf3\n33a61ff123713da26f45b399a9828e29ad25fbda7e8994c954d714375ef92156\n4ac088bf25d153ec2b9402377695b15a28019dc8087d98bd34e10fed3424125f\n\n\n            \n\n\nAppendix B  Mitre ATT&CK Techniques\n\nTactic: TechniqueATT&CK Code\nResource Development: Acquire Infrastructure: DomainsT1583.001\nResource Development: Establish Accounts: Email Accounts T1585.002\nInitial Access: Spearphishing AttachmentT1566.001\nInitial Access: Spearphishing LinkT1566.002\nExecution: Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShellT1059.001\nExecution: Command and Scripting Interpreter: Unix ShellT1059.004\nPersistence: Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys/Startup FolderT1547.001 \nPersistence: Scheduled Task/Job: Scheduled TaskT1053.005\n    \nDiscovery: System Information DiscoveryT1082\nDiscovery: Process DiscoveryT1057\n    \nCommand and Control: Application Layer Protocol: Web ProtocolsT1071.001",

                "content:encodedSnippet": "Recorded Futures Payment Fraud Intelligence team has identified a scam e-commerce network, named the ERIAKOS campaign, targeting Facebook users. This campaign, detected on April 17, 2024, involves 608 fraudulent websites using brand impersonation and malvertising tactics to steal personal and financial data. Notably, the scam websites were accessible only via mobile devices and ad lures, likely to evade automated scanners. Recorded Future recommends blocklisting suspicious merchant accounts and closely monitoring customer transactions. The use of advanced screening techniques in this campaign suggests a growing trend that might challenge current detection technologies.\nERIAKOS Scam Campaign: Unveiling a Complex Web of Fraud\nOn April 17, 2024, Recorded Futures Payment Fraud Intelligence team uncovered a network of 608 scam e-commerce websites, orchestrated by a single threat actor or group, targeting Facebook users. Named the ERIAKOS campaign after the CDN used (oss[.]eriakos[.]com), these scam sites employed brand impersonation and malvertising tactics to steal victims' financial and personal data. These fraudulent sites were accessible only through mobile devices and ad lures, a tactic aimed at evading automated detection systems and our first direct observation of such a TTP.This sophisticated campaign exclusively targeted mobile users who accessed the scam sites via ad lures on Facebook. This strategic move significantly reduced the likelihood of detection by automated scanners. Merchant accounts linked to these scam websites processed payments through major card networks and Chinese PSPs, adding another layer of complexity to the fraud.\nFinancial institutions are at risk of financial fraud, including chargeback disputes and irrecoverable losses. Impersonated businesses face reputational damage, particularly among defrauded victims. To mitigate these risks, Recorded Future advises blacklisting the suspicious merchant accounts identified in the report and monitoring transactions for potential fraud indicators.\nMitigation Strategies\nTo combat this threat, financial institutions should:\n\nIdentify and blacklist merchant accounts associated with the scam domains.\nBlock customer transactions with these merchants.\nMonitor historical transaction data to detect potential exposure to these scams.\nEncourage customers to report suspicious websites and transactions.\nShare scam website leads with Recorded Future for broader threat identification.\nLeverage Recorded Future Payment Fraud intelligence (PFI) to detect and mitigate possible scam websites using the PFI common-point-of-purchase (CPP) dataset.\nLeverage Recorded Future Brand Intelligence to detect and mitigate brand impersonation threats.\n\nFor consumers, the following precautions are recommended:\n\nOnly provide personal and payment information on secure, trusted websites.\nResearch companies thoroughly before making purchases.\nVerify the legitimacy of e-commerce websites and their payment subdomains.\nBe cautious of unsolicited communications or advertisements.\nReport any scams to your card issuer and the Better Business Bureau (BBB).\n\nTechnical Analysis\nRecorded Future identified four key indicators linking the 608 domains to the ERIAKOS campaign:\n\nContent Delivery Network: All scam sites used oss[.]eriakos[.]com.\nDomain Registrar: Domains were registered with Alibaba Cloud Computing Ltd.\nIP Addresses: Two specific IP addresses (47[.]251[.]129[.]84 and 47[.]251[.]50[.]19) were consistently used.\nDomain Misconfiguration: The scam domains exhibited specific misconfigurations between their main domains and www subdomains.\n\nThese indicators, combined with merchant account data, enabled Recorded Future to map the full extent of the scam network. The use of Chinese PSPs to process payments further complicated the detection and takedown efforts.\nOutlook\nThe ERIAKOS campaigns use of advanced screening techniques to evade detection signals a potential trend in scam tactics. If these methods become more widespread, current detection technologies may struggle to identify and mitigate similar threats, leading to prolonged scam lifespans and increased victim exposure.\nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.",

Two major Asia-Pacific intergovernmental organizations, along with multiple diplomatic, trade, and private sector entities globally, were likely compromised by TAG-100.\nKey Findings\n\nTAG-100 has compromised organizations in at least ten countries across Africa, Asia, North America, South America, and Oceania.\nThe group used open-source Go backdoors Pantegana and SparkRAT post-exploitation.\nTAG-100 targeted various internet-facing products, including Citrix NetScaler, F5 BIG-IP, Zimbra, Microsoft Exchange, SonicWall, Cisco ASA, Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect, and Fortinet FortiGate.\nFollowing the release of a PoC exploit for Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect firewall vulnerability CVE-2024-3400, TAG-100 conducted reconnaissance and attempted exploitation against dozens of US-based organizations.\n\nImpact and Implications\nThe exploitation of vulnerable internet-facing devices by TAG-100 is particularly concerning due to the limited visibility and logging capabilities of these devices. This reduces the risk of detection post-exploitation and exposes organizations to operational downtime, reputational damage, and regulatory fines. The use of open-source tools also allows state-sponsored threat actors to outsource cyber operations to less capable groups, increasing the intensity and frequency of attacks on enterprise networks.\nMitigations\nOrganizations should:\n\nConfigure intrusion detection and prevention systems to alert on and block suspicious IP addresses and domains.\nEnsure security monitoring for all external-facing services and devices.\nPrioritize patching vulnerabilities, especially those exploited in the wild.\nImplement network segmentation and multi-factor authentication.\nUse the Recorded Future Threat Intelligence module to detect and block malicious infrastructures like Pantegana, SparkRAT, and Cobalt Strike command-and-control (C2) servers in real-time.\nThe Recorded Future Third-Party Intelligence module helps monitor real-time outputs to identify suspected intrusion activities involving key vendors and partners.\nMonitoring Malicious Traffic Analysis (MTA) enables Recorded Future clients to proactively alert and monitor infrastructure involved in communication with known TAG-100 C2 IP addresses.\n\nOutlook\nTAG-100s activities highlight a persistent threat to internet-facing devices, with both financially motivated and state-sponsored threat actors likely to continue exploiting these vulnerabilities. The US and UK governments are working to improve security, but vulnerable network edges remain a significant risk. Financially motivated and state-sponsored threat actors will likely continue exploiting these vulnerabilities.\nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.",

Because threat intelligence solutions can be used in a wide variety of ways, it is important to identify your potential use cases before you choose a <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com\">threat intelligence platform</a>, rather than picking a solution and then trying to conform your use cases to the strengths of that solution.</p><p>Threat intelligence use cases can streamline the incident response process. In its recent <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/5037731\">Market Guide</a>, the technology research company Gartner suggests that end users of cyber threat intelligence solutions identify their best solution by <strong>taking a use-case-centric approach</strong>.</p><p>For example, you may wish to gain insights into the identity, methods, and motives of threat actors targeting you so that you can avoid future threats and adjust or update your security; you may wish to create case studies for use in training exercises; or you may wish to gather more threat data so that you can <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/vulnerability-intelligence\">prioritize vulnerability management based on the risks</a> that your organization is particularly vulnerable to  Gartner provides a long list of possible use cases that are important to consider before choosing a solution.</p><p>Before making expensive and informed security decisions on how to improve your security operations and programs, review Gartners five examples below on the most effective uses of threat intelligence platforms.</p><br><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/5_threat_intelligence_use_cases_f78bcb495e.webp\" alt=\"Threat Intelligence Use Cases\"></p><br><h3 id=\"1-enriching-other-security-technologies-by-integrating-threat-intelligence\">1. Enriching Other Security Technologies by Integrating Threat Intelligence</h3><p>These are the basics  integrating cyber threat intelligence into your already existing security processes improves decision-making for incident response and enhances your security policy. According to Gartner, cyber threat intelligence has recently begun to be widely incorporated into most security technology verticals, including security information and event management (SIEM), firewalls and unified <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/integrations/threat-intelligence-management\">threat management systems</a>, intrusion detection and prevention, secure web gateways and secure email gateways, endpoint protection, web application protection, distributed denial of service, vulnerability management, security orchestration, and more.</p><p>If your organization does not already include threat intelligence in its security program, a good place to start is by <strong>looking at what you are already using and seeing how threat intelligence can make it more effective</strong>. Many threat intelligence solutions offer machine-readable intelligence that can integrate frictionlessly with the security products you already use, and an increasing number of solutions are using open-source standards, making it easier than ever to share data across platforms.</p><h3 id=\"2-vulnerability-prioritization-for-security-teams\">2. Vulnerability Prioritization For Security Teams</h3><p>One of the best uses for an effective <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/threat-intelligence-program\">threat intelligence program</a> is to gather data and perform analysis that will help your organization create a simple metric for evaluating vulnerabilities. This metric should be a measure of the overlap between the problems you can fix and the solutions that will make the biggest difference, given the time and resources available to you.</p><p>The traditional approach to prioritizing vulnerabilities comes from the attitude that the best security approach is to patch everything, all the time, everywhere. Achieving this goal would, in theory, lead to a perfectly impenetrable system  but it sets an impossibly high standard. So organizations that follow this approach will inevitably make compromises and go after the biggest problems first.</p><p>But, contrary to popular belief, the biggest problems (based on how much damage they actually cause) are not issues like zero-day threats or clever new exploits, but the same old vulnerabilities that continue to be exploited, precisely because so many organizations prioritize new threats within their threat hunting instead of focusing on improving their fundamentals.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/threat-actors/threat-actor-types\">Threat actors</a> are just as limited  if not more so  by time and the resources available to them as you are. They naturally will tend to use the simplest, least resource-intensive exploit as long as it continues to provide results.</p><p>In its analysis of vulnerabilities discovered over the last decade, Gartner found that <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/vulnerability-database\">new CVEs</a> were found at a mostly steady rate, while the number of exploits grew exponentially over the same period. This indicates that the vast majority of new exploits were variations on old ones  making it clear that any organizations top priority should be patching already-known vulnerabilities rather than worrying about new threats.</p><h3 id=\"3-open-deep-and-dark-web-monitoring\">3. Open, Deep, and Dark Web Monitoring</h3><p>A <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/threat-intelligence\">threat intelligence solution</a> should gather its threat data from both open and closed sources on the internet.</p><p>Open sources, in short, are publicly available to everyone on the internet. This includes all the data that is indexed on search engines, which is sometimes called the surface web. Although this comprises some 4.56 billion pages, the public part of the internet only makes up about four percent of all data online.</p><p>The other 96 percent is divided between the deep web and the dark web. The deep web, which makes up about 90 percent of that data, refers to those parts of the internet that are locked away behind secure logins or paywalls, leaving them out of the reach of search engine crawlers. Most of this information includes scientific, academic, or government reports, personal information like financial records or medical histories, and private company databases.</p><p>The dark web, which makes up the remaining six percent of all the data on the internet, is made up of websites that can only be reached through browsers like Tor, which provide encryption and anonymity. Although this is not exclusively the case, many websites provide marketplaces for illegal goods and services.</p><p><a href=\"https://recordedfuture.com/cvss-score-vulnerabilities\">Vulnerabilities and their exploits</a> are commonly discussed and traded in spaces on both the dark and deep web, both by parties that would wish to keep them safe, and by threat actors. That makes it essential to gather threat data from these <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/intelligence-sources-collection/threat-intelligence-sources\">threat intelligence sources</a> to maintain a more comprehensive and up-to-date picture of what threats are out there.</p><p>Because accessing these spaces requires more skill and comes with higher risks, one of the principal values of certain threat intelligence solutions is that they will do it for you. According to <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/5037731\">Gartners Market Guide</a>, it can take many years of experience to effectively infiltrate these spaces and provide effective and timely analysis, and the most effective threat intelligence program will come with expert analysis that cannot be replicated by any algorithm.</p><h3 id=\"4-brand-monitoring\">4. Brand Monitoring</h3><p>Although discussions about vulnerabilities and exploits will mostly take place in the closed parts of the internet, there is still great value in choosing an actionable threat intelligence platform that will monitor open sources as well, particularly for emerging <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/intelligence-sources-collection/social-media-threat-intelligence\">cyber threats on social media channels</a>. Identifying threats in this arena is a skill in itself, requiring an awareness of your organizations brand and the many ways a threat actor may seek to exploit it.</p><p>Because these threats appear in public spaces and are subject to wider scrutiny, they can be more subtle, often relying on social engineering techniques instead of software exploits, and take a degree of expertise to recognize.</p><p>For example, a <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/brand-intelligence\">threat intelligence solution that includes brand monitoring</a> may look for fake or malicious social media profiles that have been accepted by your staff or even mimic your staffs profiles, identify malicious links that have been posted to your social media profiles, or even evaluate intellectual property loss and theft.</p><p>Cyber attacks that can be identified through social media and brand monitoring include phishing, false flag schemes, domain fraud, or activist or trolling attacks. Professionally developed threat intelligence solutions are much more efficient and will generate fewer false positives than open-source tools or ad hoc approaches.</p><h3 id=\"5-threat-indicator-investigation-enrichment-and-response\">5. Threat Indicator Investigation, Enrichment, and Response</h3><p>Not every attack can be prevented, of course, and one of the values of many threat intelligence solutions is their ability to improve the speed and accuracy of your incident response through operational threat intelligence.

The intelligence community plays a crucial role in utilizing OSINT for national security and cybersecurity efforts. </p><br><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/osint_how_is_open_source_intelligence_used_991120581e.webp\" alt=\"How is Open Source Intelligence Used?\"></p><br><p>There are two common use cases:</p><h3 id=\"1-ethical-hacking-and-penetration-testing\">1. Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing</h3><p>Security professionals use open source intelligence to identify potential weaknesses in friendly networks so that they can be remediated before they are exploited by threat actors. Commonly found weaknesses include:</p><ul><li>Accidental leaks of sensitive data, like through <a href=\"https://recordedfuture.com/blog/social-media-threat-intelligence\">social media</a>. Identifying and protecting sensitive data is crucial to reduce the risk of cybersecurity threats.</li><li>Open ports or unsecured internet-connected devices</li><li>Unpatched software, such as websites running old versions of common CMS products</li><li>Leaked or exposed assets, such as proprietary code on pastebins</li></ul><h3 id=\"2-identifying-external-threats\">2. Identifying External Threats</h3><p>As weve discussed many times in the past, the internet is an excellent source of insights into an organizations most pressing <a href=\"https://recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/cyber-threats/emerging-threats\">emerging threats</a>. From identifying which new <a href=\"https://recordedfuture.com/blog/exploiting-old-vulnerabilities\">vulnerabilities are being actively exploited</a> to intercepting threat actor chatter about an upcoming attack, open source intelligence enables security professionals to prioritize their time and resources to address the most significant current threats.</p><p>In most cases, this type of work requires an analyst to identify and correlate multiple data points to validate a threat before action is taken. OSINT tools are used to gather and analyze data from public and open sources, including social media networks and the deep web, to identify and correlate multiple data points for threat validation. For example, while a single threatening tweet may not be cause for concern, that same tweet would be viewed in a different light if it were tied to a threat group known to be active in a specific industry.</p><p>One of the most important things to understand about open source intelligence is that it is often used in combination with other intelligence subtypes. Intelligence from closed sources such as internal telemetry, closed <a href=\"https://recordedfuture.com/blog/dark-web-networks\">dark web communities</a>, and external intelligence-sharing communities is regularly used to filter and verify open source intelligence. There are a variety of tools available to help analysts perform these functions, which well look at a bit later on.</p><h2 id=\"the-dark-side-of-open-source-intelligence\">The Dark Side of Open Source Intelligence</h2><p>At this point, its time to address the second major issue with open source intelligence: <strong>if something is readily available to intelligence analysts, its also readily available to threat actors.</strong></p><p><strong>Threat actors use open source intelligence tools and techniques to identify potential targets and exploit weaknesses in target networks.</strong> Once a vulnerability is identified, it is often an <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-i-hacked-40-websites-in-7-minutes-5b4c28bc8824\">extremely quick and simple process</a> to exploit it and achieve a variety of malicious objectives. They also seek out sensitive data that can be exploited for malicious purposes, such as launching targeted attacks or selling the information on the dark web.</p><p>This process is the main reason why so many small and medium-sized enterprises get hacked each year. It isnt because threat groups specifically take an interest in them, but rather because vulnerabilities in their network or website architecture are found using simple open source intelligence techniques. In short, they are easy targets.</p><p>And open source intelligence doesnt only enable technical attacks on IT systems and networks. <strong>Different <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/threat-actors/threat-actor-types\">types of threat actors</a> also seek out information about individuals and organizations that can be used to inform sophisticated social engineering campaigns using <a href=\"https://recordedfuture.com/blog/podcast-episode-31\">phishing</a> (email), vishing (phone or voicemail), and SMiShing (SMS).</strong> Often, seemingly innocuous information shared through social networks and blogs can be used to develop highly convincing social engineering campaigns, which in turn are used to trick well-meaning users into compromising their organizations network or assets.</p><p>This is why using open source intelligence for security purposes is so important  It gives you an opportunity to find and fix weaknesses in your organizations network and remove sensitive information <em>before</em> a threat actor uses the same tools and techniques to exploit them.</p><h2 id=\"open-source-intelligence-techniques-and-osint-tools\">Open Source Intelligence Techniques and OSINT Tools</h2><p>Now that weve covered the uses of open source intelligence (both good and bad) its time to look at some of the techniques that can be used to gather and process open source information.</p><br><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/osint_techniques_c41b559086.webp\" alt=\"OSINT Techniques\"></p><br><p>First, <strong>you must have a clear strategy and <a href=\"https://recordedfuture.com/blog/analytical-threat-intelligence-frameworks\">framework</a> in place for acquiring and using open source intelligence. Its not recommended to approach open source intelligence from the perspective of finding anything and everything that might be interesting or useful</strong>  as weve already discussed, the sheer volume of information available through open sources will simply overwhelm you.</p><p>It is also crucial to select the right OSINT tool for your specific intelligence gathering goals. These tools, such as Spiderfoot, searchcode, Searx, Twint, and Metagoofil, can help discover and store large quantities of data, find links and patterns among different pieces of information, and collate discovered information into actionable intelligence.</p><p>Instead, <strong>you must know exactly what youre trying to achieve</strong>  for example, to identify and remediate weaknesses in your network  and focus your energies specifically on accomplishing those goals.</p><p>Second, <strong>you must identify a set of tools and techniques for collecting and processing open source information</strong>. Once again, the volume of information available is much too great for manual processes to be even slightly effective.</p><h3 id=\"passive-vs-active-osint\">Passive vs. Active OSINT</h3><p>Broadly speaking, collection of open source intelligence falls into two categories: passive collection and active collection.</p><p><strong>Passive collection</strong> often involves the use of <a href=\"https://recordedfuture.com/blog/threat-intelligence-platform\">threat intelligence platforms (TIPs)</a> to combine a variety of <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/intelligence-sources-collection/threat-intelligence-feeds\">threat feeds</a> into a single, easily accessible location. While this is a major step up from manual intelligence harvesting, the risk of information overload is still significant.</p><p>More advanced threat intelligence solutions like Recorded Future solve this problem by using artificial intelligence, <a href=\"https://recordedfuture.com/blog/machine-learning-threat-intelligence\">machine learning</a>, and natural language processing to automate the process of prioritizing and dismissing alerts based on an organizations specific needs. Additionally, using an OSINT tool can further streamline this process by gathering and analyzing massive amounts of data from public and open sources, <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/intelligence-sources-collection/social-media-threat-intelligence\">including social media networks</a> and the deep web.</p><p>In a similar manner, organized threat groups often use botnets to collect valuable information using techniques like traffic sniffing and keylogging.</p><p><strong>Active collection</strong> is the use of a variety of techniques to search for specific insights or information. For security professionals, this type of collection work is usually done for one of two reasons:</p><ol><li>A passively collected alert has highlighted a potential threat and further insight is required.</li><li>The focus of an intelligence gathering exercise is very specific, such as a penetration testing exercise.</li></ol><p>To close things out, well take a look at some of the most commonly used tools for collecting and processing open source intelligence.</p><p>While there are many free and useful tools available to security professionals and threat actors alike, <strong>some of the most commonly used (and abused) open source intelligence tools are search engines like Google</strong>  just not as most of us know them.</p><p>As weve already explained, <strong>one of the biggest issues facing security professionals is the regularity with which normal, well-meaning users accidentally leave sensitive assets and information exposed to the internet</strong>. There are a series of advanced search functions called <a href=\"https://recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/threat-analysis-techniques/google-dorks\">Google dork</a> queries that can be used to identify the information and assets they expose.</p><p>Google dork queries are based on the search operators used by IT professionals and hackers on a daily basis to conduct their work. Common examples include filetype:, which narrows search results to a specific file type, and site:, which only returns results from a specified website or domain.</p><p>The Public Intelligence website offers a <a href=\"https://publicintelligence.net/feds-google-dorking\">more thorough rundown of Google dork queries</a>, in which they give the following example search:</p><p><em>sensitive but unclassified filetype:pdf site:publicintelligence.net</em></p><p>If you type this search term into a search engine, it returns only PDF documents from the <a href=\"http://publicintelligence.net/\">Public Intelligence website</a> that contain the words sensitive but unclassified somewhere in the document text. As you can imagine, with hundreds of commands at their disposal, security professionals and threat actors can use similar techniques to search for almost anything.</p><p>Moving beyond search engines, there are literally hundreds of tools that can be used to identify network weaknesses or exposed assets. For example, you can use<a href=\"https://wappalyzer.com/\"> Wappalyzer</a> to identify which technologies are used on a website, and combine the results with<a href=\"https://sploitus.com/\"> Sploitus</a> or the <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/\">National Vulnerability Database</a> to determine whether any relevant vulnerabilities exist. Taking things a step further, you could use a more advanced threat intelligence solution like Recorded Future to determine whether any <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/vulnerability-database\">recent vulnerabilities</a> are being actively exploited, or included in any active exploit kits.</p><h2 id=\"osint-faq\">OSINT FAQ</h2><h3 id=\"is-osint-legal\">Is OSINT legal?</h3><p>Yes, OSINT is generally legal since it involves <a href=\"https://recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/intelligence-sources-collection/information-gathering\">gathering information</a> that is publicly available. However, the legality can become a gray area depending on how the information is used or if attempts are made to access restricted or private data under the guise of OSINT. It is crucial to ensure that while gathering information, sensitive data is protected to prevent it from being exploited by attackers.</p><h3 id=\"what-is-the-dark-side-of-osint\">What is the dark side of OSINT?</h3><p>The dark side of OSINT emerges when sensitive data is gathered and misused for malicious purposes. This can include stalking, harassment, doxxing, or even planning cyber-attacks. While OSINT itself is a valuable tool for many positive uses, like any tool, it can be misused in the wrong hands.</p><h3 id=\"how-is-osint-utilized-to-gather-intelligence-from-the-dark-web-and-what-precautions-should-be-taken\">How is OSINT utilized to gather intelligence from the dark web, and what precautions should be taken?</h3><p>OSINT is employed to uncover hidden services and forums on the dark web, aiding in <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/incident-response-management/cyber-crime-investigation\">cybercrime investigations</a> or threat detection. The use of OSINT tools, such as Spiderfoot and Twint, is crucial in uncovering and analyzing data from these hidden sources. However, venturing into the dark web requires precautions:</p><ol><li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> Ensure actions comply with legal and ethical guidelines.</li><li><strong>Privacy Protection:</strong> Avoid infringing on individual privacy.</li><li><strong>Secure Browsing:</strong> Use tools like Tor for secure browsing.</li><li><strong>Malware Protection:</strong> Employ robust malware protection to guard against malicious software.</li><li><strong>Data Verification:</strong> Verify the accuracy of the information collected through multiple sources.</li></ol><p>These measures help ensure the safe and lawful use of OSINT in gathering intelligence from the dark web.</p><h2 id=\"start-with-the-end-in-mind\">Start With the End in Mind</h2><p>The most important factor in the success of any open source intelligence initiative is the presence of a clear strategy  once you know what youre trying to accomplish and youve set objectives accordingly, identifying the most useful tools and techniques will be much more achievable.</p><p>To learn more about how Recorded Future can help organizations better understand and prevent threats, <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/demo?utm_campaign=rf-blog-bottom-book-a-demo-text-cta&utm_source=recordedfuture&utm_medium=webiste&utm_content=rf-blog-bottom-book-a-demo-text-cta&utm_term=rf-blog-bottom-book-a-demo-text-cta\">request a personalized demo</a> today.</p><p><em>This article was originally published February 19, 2019, and last updated on Jun 24, 2024.</em></p>",

Often, seemingly innocuous information shared through social networks and blogs can be used to develop highly convincing social engineering campaigns, which in turn are used to trick well-meaning users into compromising their organizations network or assets.\nThis is why using open source intelligence for security purposes is so important  It gives you an opportunity to find and fix weaknesses in your organizations network and remove sensitive information before a threat actor uses the same tools and techniques to exploit them.\nOpen Source Intelligence Techniques and OSINT Tools\nNow that weve covered the uses of open source intelligence (both good and bad) its time to look at some of the techniques that can be used to gather and process open source information.\n\n\n\nFirst, you must have a clear strategy and framework in place for acquiring and using open source intelligence. Its not recommended to approach open source intelligence from the perspective of finding anything and everything that might be interesting or useful  as weve already discussed, the sheer volume of information available through open sources will simply overwhelm you.\nIt is also crucial to select the right OSINT tool for your specific intelligence gathering goals. These tools, such as Spiderfoot, searchcode, Searx, Twint, and Metagoofil, can help discover and store large quantities of data, find links and patterns among different pieces of information, and collate discovered information into actionable intelligence.\nInstead, you must know exactly what youre trying to achieve  for example, to identify and remediate weaknesses in your network  and focus your energies specifically on accomplishing those goals.\nSecond, you must identify a set of tools and techniques for collecting and processing open source information. Once again, the volume of information available is much too great for manual processes to be even slightly effective.\nPassive vs. Active OSINT\nBroadly speaking, collection of open source intelligence falls into two categories: passive collection and active collection.\nPassive collection often involves the use of threat intelligence platforms (TIPs) to combine a variety of threat feeds into a single, easily accessible location. While this is a major step up from manual intelligence harvesting, the risk of information overload is still significant.\nMore advanced threat intelligence solutions like Recorded Future solve this problem by using artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing to automate the process of prioritizing and dismissing alerts based on an organizations specific needs. Additionally, using an OSINT tool can further streamline this process by gathering and analyzing massive amounts of data from public and open sources, including social media networks and the deep web.\nIn a similar manner, organized threat groups often use botnets to collect valuable information using techniques like traffic sniffing and keylogging.\nActive collection is the use of a variety of techniques to search for specific insights or information. For security professionals, this type of collection work is usually done for one of two reasons:\n\nA passively collected alert has highlighted a potential threat and further insight is required.\nThe focus of an intelligence gathering exercise is very specific, such as a penetration testing exercise.\n\nTo close things out, well take a look at some of the most commonly used tools for collecting and processing open source intelligence.\nWhile there are many free and useful tools available to security professionals and threat actors alike, some of the most commonly used (and abused) open source intelligence tools are search engines like Google  just not as most of us know them.\nAs weve already explained, one of the biggest issues facing security professionals is the regularity with which normal, well-meaning users accidentally leave sensitive assets and information exposed to the internet. There are a series of advanced search functions called Google dork queries that can be used to identify the information and assets they expose.\nGoogle dork queries are based on the search operators used by IT professionals and hackers on a daily basis to conduct their work. Common examples include filetype:, which narrows search results to a specific file type, and site:, which only returns results from a specified website or domain.\nThe Public Intelligence website offers a more thorough rundown of Google dork queries, in which they give the following example search:\nsensitive but unclassified filetype:pdf site:publicintelligence.net\nIf you type this search term into a search engine, it returns only PDF documents from the Public Intelligence website that contain the words sensitive but unclassified somewhere in the document text. As you can imagine, with hundreds of commands at their disposal, security professionals and threat actors can use similar techniques to search for almost anything.\nMoving beyond search engines, there are literally hundreds of tools that can be used to identify network weaknesses or exposed assets. For example, you can use Wappalyzer to identify which technologies are used on a website, and combine the results with Sploitus or the National Vulnerability Database to determine whether any relevant vulnerabilities exist. Taking things a step further, you could use a more advanced threat intelligence solution like Recorded Future to determine whether any recent vulnerabilities are being actively exploited, or included in any active exploit kits.\nOSINT FAQ\nIs OSINT legal?\nYes, OSINT is generally legal since it involves gathering information that is publicly available. However, the legality can become a gray area depending on how the information is used or if attempts are made to access restricted or private data under the guise of OSINT. It is crucial to ensure that while gathering information, sensitive data is protected to prevent it from being exploited by attackers.\nWhat is the dark side of OSINT?\nThe dark side of OSINT emerges when sensitive data is gathered and misused for malicious purposes. This can include stalking, harassment, doxxing, or even planning cyber-attacks. While OSINT itself is a valuable tool for many positive uses, like any tool, it can be misused in the wrong hands.\nHow is OSINT utilized to gather intelligence from the dark web, and what precautions should be taken?\nOSINT is employed to uncover hidden services and forums on the dark web, aiding in cybercrime investigations or threat detection. The use of OSINT tools, such as Spiderfoot and Twint, is crucial in uncovering and analyzing data from these hidden sources. However, venturing into the dark web requires precautions:\n\nLegal Compliance: Ensure actions comply with legal and ethical guidelines.\nPrivacy Protection: Avoid infringing on individual privacy.\nSecure Browsing: Use tools like Tor for secure browsing.\nMalware Protection: Employ robust malware protection to guard against malicious software.\nData Verification: Verify the accuracy of the information collected through multiple sources.\n\nThese measures help ensure the safe and lawful use of OSINT in gathering intelligence from the dark web.\nStart With the End in Mind\nThe most important factor in the success of any open source intelligence initiative is the presence of a clear strategy  once you know what youre trying to accomplish and youve set objectives accordingly, identifying the most useful tools and techniques will be much more achievable.\nTo learn more about how Recorded Future can help organizations better understand and prevent threats, request a personalized demo today.\nThis article was originally published February 19, 2019, and last updated on Jun 24, 2024.",

HVEs and DVEs are expected to conduct various physical threat activities, including violent attacks and disruptive demonstrations, in 2024. The resurgence of the Islamic States Khorasan Province (ISKP) in Afghanistan may increase the frequency of HVE attacks. While mass-casualty plots are likely to be stopped by law enforcement, lone actor and small cell operations remain significant threats. </p><p><strong>Israel-Hamas Conflict and US Elections Drive Violent Extremist Threats in 2024</strong></p><p>The geopolitical turmoil surrounding the Israel-Hamas conflict and the upcoming 2024 US presidential election has created a volatile environment that is likely to spur increased activities from HVEs and DVEs throughout the year. These developments are expected to drive physical threat activities, posing significant risks to public and private sector leaders, facilities, and communities.</p><p><strong>Homegrown Violent Extremists (HVEs)</strong></p><p>HVEs, particularly supporters of the Islamic State (IS) and al-Qaeda, are poised to remain significant threats in 2024. The Israel-Hamas conflict serves as a potent motivator, likely leading to increased recruitment and mobilization efforts by jihadist groups. ISKP in Afghanistan has enhanced its external operations capabilities, raising concerns about more frequent and sophisticated attacks in the US. These extremists typically conduct attacks as lone actors or in small cells, making it challenging for law enforcement to intercept and prevent such incidents.</p><p><strong>Domestic Violent Extremists</strong></p><p>In 2024, DVEs are very likely to carry out physical threat activities against US government personnel, racial, ethnic, and religious minorities, commercial facilities, and US critical infrastructure.

                "content:encodedSnippet": "The ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict, the upcoming 2024 US presidential election, and the rise of violent extremist content online are likely to escalate homegrown and domestic violent extremist (HVE and DVE) threats. HVEs and DVEs are expected to conduct various physical threat activities, including violent attacks and disruptive demonstrations, in 2024. The resurgence of the Islamic States Khorasan Province (ISKP) in Afghanistan may increase the frequency of HVE attacks. While mass-casualty plots are likely to be stopped by law enforcement, lone actor and small cell operations remain significant threats. \nIsrael-Hamas Conflict and US Elections Drive Violent Extremist Threats in 2024\nThe geopolitical turmoil surrounding the Israel-Hamas conflict and the upcoming 2024 US presidential election has created a volatile environment that is likely to spur increased activities from HVEs and DVEs throughout the year. These developments are expected to drive physical threat activities, posing significant risks to public and private sector leaders, facilities, and communities.\nHomegrown Violent Extremists (HVEs)\nHVEs, particularly supporters of the Islamic State (IS) and al-Qaeda, are poised to remain significant threats in 2024. The Israel-Hamas conflict serves as a potent motivator, likely leading to increased recruitment and mobilization efforts by jihadist groups. ISKP in Afghanistan has enhanced its external operations capabilities, raising concerns about more frequent and sophisticated attacks in the US. These extremists typically conduct attacks as lone actors or in small cells, making it challenging for law enforcement to intercept and prevent such incidents.\nDomestic Violent Extremists\nIn 2024, DVEs are very likely to carry out physical threat activities against US government personnel, racial, ethnic, and religious minorities, commercial facilities, and US critical infrastructure. While white supremacist and neo-Nazi violent extremists are most likely among DVEs to conduct mass-casualty terrorist attacks, we project that anti-government and anarchist violent extremists will increase physical threat operations in 2024. High levels of contestation and polarization during the 2024 US election cycle will very likely lead to greater levels of DVE violence.\nKey targets include facilities and personnel associated with racial, ethnic, and religious minorities, the LGBTQIA+ community, government agencies, and critical infrastructure. The motivations behind these attacks are often rooted in ideological beliefs and reactions to domestic political or geopolitical events.\nTo monitor threats from violent extremists, organizations can leverage the Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud to track references to their organizations, reactions to ongoing geopolitical and domestic political events, and promotion of TTPs for physical threat activities in sources popular among DVEs and HVEs. \nTo read the entire analysis with endnotes, click here to download the report as a PDF.",

Then I decided that I wanted a more secure  pun intended  career path that didnt hinge on my creative output. I sub-majored in network security in university and took a chance on a cybersecurity graduate position, which I really ended up liking. Ive kind of been doing both ever since. </p><h3 id=\"whats-your-role-at-canva\">Whats your role at Canva?</h3><p>(Zito) I lead the Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) team. Since starting in this industry, I have tried a little bit of everything  incident response, security engineering, vulnerability management. Eventually, I settled on specializing in CTI and have been doing that ever since.</p><p>When I joined Canva, the role was actually to help build out the detection and response capability. While interviewing, I had some candid discussions with the head of security at the time, and we both agreed it didnt make sense for there to be any dedicated CTI capability without a mature detection and response team first. Theres honestly no point in threat intelligence if theres no way to action it, and to do that you need a solid incident response team as your foundation. Imagine flipping over all these rocks and theres no-one around to deal with the spiders!</p><p>After a year or two, we felt we were ready to build out a CTI program, which weve done from scratch.  While weve made a huge amount of progress, were still a very lean team and Im still on a bit of everything train: I engineer our collections, automation and intelligence sharing infrastructure; maintain intelligence requirements and alerting use cases; still tag-team on incidents where intelligence analysis can benefit; and design ways for strategic threat intelligence to make its way to the right areas of the business.</p><h3 id=\"to-bianca-forbes-how-did-you-get-started-in-cybersecurity-and-what-is-your-role-at-canva\">(To Bianca Forbes) How did you get started in cybersecurity? And what is your role at Canva?</h3><p>(Bianca Forbes) I actually started out in penetration testing, which I did for three years, before moving into cyber threat intelligence. When I first got into CTI, I didnt know much about it. After getting thrown in the deep end, I came to really enjoy researching and tracking adversaries as well as the contacts in the intelligence community that I made. Ive been doing it ever since.</p><p>At Canva, I help run the CTI program with Jasmina. I focus primarily on intelligence operations: tracking adversaries, reporting on trends in the threat landscape, providing analysis expertise in investigations, and crafting threat hunting packages.</p><h3 id=\"how-did-you-get-buy-in-for-building-a-cyber-threat-intelligence-cti-program-why-should-other-companies-consider-investing-in-threat-intelligence\">How did you get buy-in for building a Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) program? Why should other companies consider investing in threat intelligence?</h3><p>(Zito) To use an industry buzzword  CTI really helps security teams shift left. Traditionally, without CTI, you may be detecting and responding to threats using only the information you have from within your own network. Youre looking for something bad but youre not always sure what, how, or when. </p><p><strong>In my mind, once you detect a threat, you&#39;ve already got it in your environment. Its too late. It&#39;s already happened.</strong></p><p>I think what really helped me get buy-in was to actually start producing CTI products to showcase their value. At the heart of it, the value of threat intelligence is influencing: you use your deliverables to convince the business to do something, whether its investing in a capability, changing the way something is done, or paying more attention to an identified risk. </p><p>You obviously have to start small and be very curated when you dont have dedicated resources. Ive seen it go wrong when emerging teams simply rehash the news or flick on all the threat feeds, which causes a lot of frustration for the people who have to do extra work as a result of the onslaught of new, incoming information. You have to start somewhere but you also have to know what you want out of it all. This is where threat modeling can help. Understanding your organizations crown jewels and what the risks are (your intelligence requirements) helps you be more strategic about where to start.</p><p>In my talk at Recorded Future Predict23 in Singapore, I mentioned a few tips based on lessons learned over time.</p><p><strong>Tip #1:</strong> Instead of sending out daily security news summaries to a mailing list, try referencing a security report in an action item sent directly to the team who can remediate a specific security risk. </p><p>Being that filter between all the sensationalized articles and what your organization actually needs to action helped us build rapport and trust between teams. If you meet your peers halfway, actually read the report and try to make a call on what needs to be done and by whom, youve reduced a lot of mental labor for everyone involved. An added bonus is that you subconsciously train folks to pay attention to when you send them something, otherwise I wager pretty strongly that those daily digests are going to end up in the junk pile a lot of the time.</p><p><strong>Tip #2:</strong> Instead of turning on threat intelligence modules and data feeds in all of your security tools, try only ingesting high-fidelity observables that directly map to a threat youre concerned about. </p><p>That doesnt mean you need to intentionally miss out on a bunch of data during collections. Something Bianca and I have built out is kind of like a tier-based system. All of the observables from our commercial and open source come into the threat intelligence platform (TIP), and they actually all go to the SIEM as well, but that doesnt mean they all are treated the same way. The bulk, raw data is used for enrichment and historical referencing. Then, as part of our usual operational cadence, we will research and validate a subset of observables that meet our intelligence requirements. </p><p>Based on our research, well add extra context and metadata to those observables and intentionally mark them as curated so that they become active in our security tools and can be used in detection or prevention rules. This way, we combat the perception that CTI is just a stream of low-fidelity observables that cause a lot of noise and alert fatigue. </p><p>Once we had that foundation of trust and confidence in the value and fidelity of the curated data, we could then weigh in on the detection engineering process by providing expertise on what metadata can be used  out of the remaining uncurated observable data  to satisfy specific detection use cases.</p><h3 id=\"as-youre-putting-together-your-cyber-threat-intelligence-function-what-kind-of-information-is-needed\">As you&#39;re putting together your Cyber Threat Intelligence function, what kind of information is needed?</h3><p>(Zito) Once you&#39;ve got your intelligence requirements  pick three to start off with and then work back from there you could ask yourself:</p><ul><li>What information do I need to answer those questions? </li><li>Is it open source information? Is it commercial intelligence? A mixture of both?</li><li>What data do I need?  How will I then consume that data? </li><li>Do I have a threat intelligence platform?</li></ul><p>You need to figure out where you&#39;re going to put all of that information, and understand whether you have the technical capability to actually manage all of that infrastructure yourself. If you&#39;re a small team and you don&#39;t have a lot of engineering resources, maybe you&#39;ll actually start off with something commercial and buy instead of build so you dont have to think about managing infrastructure and can instead focus on actual analysis.</p><p>It can be tempting to get started using open source tooling. I love that theres passionate people out there collectively building free tools to help with CTI operations. I would be cautious here about the time and skills needed to maintain some of these systems, as they can require a bit of TLC and jerry-rigging. Again, starting small and being intentional about your desired outcome is your best shot at incremental success.</p><p>When it comes to people, there are a lot of varying skills among CTI practitioners. For example, because of Bianca&#39;s pentesting background, shes very technically proficient and good at researching how adversary TTPs evolve; and there are other folks who specialize in what I would call more traditional intelligence analysis. It really just depends on your organization and what&#39;s going to work best to satisfy your intelligence requirements.  </p><p>If, like Canva, your organization is tech and software-centric, maybe its important you have people with the technical ability to understand how the latest obscure exploit could actually impact you, if at all. Whereas, if you are in critical infrastructure, maybe you need a bit more of that geopolitical background to help you understand which APT groups are a threat to your organization by understanding why somebody would try to come after critical infrastructure in the first place. </p><h3 id=\"how-do-you-think-about-connecting-your-people-tools-and-workflows\">How do you think about connecting your people, tools and workflows?</h3><p>(Zito) If you think about the teams consuming your intelligence products as customers, you need to understand their ways of working, their pain points, and what they need from you to support them. I usually pick one customer at a time, and pilot a workflow end-to-end based after sitting down with them and understanding <strong><em>their</em></strong> requirements.</p><p>If youre into games, pretend this is a role-playing game (RPG) and youre the support class. Your job is throwing heals and buffs. Youre likely not on the front lines in the heat of the battle, so its not really fair if you insist on calling all the shots.</p><p>If you use your blue team / SOC as an example first customer, they very likely have their own tooling for detections, their own case management system to house investigations and incidents, and their own internal comms channels. Nobody wants to receive an email with an attached report that has a bunch of random observables listed at the end in no particular format, that they then have to manually put into a system. What a waste of time!</p><p>When you talk to your blue team, you may learn that if they could have anything they wanted, it would be for someone to do all that for them and to not have to think about it. Theres no real reason they need to read a report for the threat to be blocked. If they need context, theyll be able to find it <strong>if</strong> an alert ever triggers. </p><p>Unfortunately, we (CTI) really dont want to be copy-paste robots either. So we automate. In cases where the analysis has already been done and all we need to do is block some hashes or C2 IPs, why does anyone have to be involved in the process? CTI should be able to click a button to validate an observable, and based on metadata, it goes where it needs to go. Thats essentially what we ended up building. </p><p>And that actually means now that when an intelligence report is published, its much more likely to be read, because the last one wasnt just a day ago. <strong>We want people to feel confident that silence from us equals no threat to worry about.</strong></p><p>(Forbes) A good example of an integrated workflow with Recorded Future is how we develop threat hunting packages. Our team is continually tracking trends in the threat landscape and we have processes to help us identify what is relevant to us. Reflecting back on the idea behind the tier-based system we have for observables, we consume all of the threat hunting packages Recorded Future publishes. Once we identify a threat trend we want to hunt for, we can use the relevant ingested packages as a building block for the final deliverable. Its especially helpful considering they come with YARA rules and TTPs, so it reduces some of the manual work we have to do. </p><p>Once a hunting package is developed, weve built an automated message that sends all the relevant information to the threat hunting team, again, integrating with their workflow and tooling. Another benefit of working closely with our customers when designing integrations is we can get valuable feedback about the outcomes of our intelligence products.</p><p>Another example workflow is how we mitigate risks associated with our supply chain vendors. By populating our suppliers watch list within Recorded Future, we can then look for things like who&#39;s attacking our suppliers. An example would be if one of our critical vendors has been posted on a ransomware blog site. Oftentimes we&#39;ll learn about that through Recorded Future before the vendor even reaches out and says, Hey, we&#39;ve had an incident. Yeah, we know we&#39;ve been watching. Recorded Future allows us to get on the front foot in those types of situations.</p><h3 id=\"how-do-you-showcase-the-value-that-youre-bringing-to-the-rest-of-the-security-organization-and-to-the-rest-of-the-company\">How do you showcase the value that youre bringing to the rest of the security organization? And to the rest of the company?</h3><p>(Zito) We track the fidelity of our deliverables by showing how much information and data we consume and how much of that turned into some kind of action. </p><p>For example, if we pulled in 100 threat reports; shortlisted 20 based on the topic meeting our intelligence requirements; and only 3 turned into an internal threat bulletin with recommended actions - thats actually a good thing. It shows that we filtered and curated information really well before it got on anyones to-do list.</p><p>It doesnt stop at recommendations or information shared, though. We also want to know how much of the work we have generated for other teams resulted in something useful. If we published a threat hunting package and no malicious activity was uncovered, thats great. But what else did we discover? Were there any new detection ideas as a result? Is there any additional telemetry that we could monitor? </p><p>When we&#39;re talking about showing value to the broader organization, it&#39;s really about taking the macro trends from all of those metrics and surfacing it into high level insights. Imagine if you started out thinking malware was your biggest threat because thats what your industrys threat landscape is telling you. </p><p>Once you start collecting data about the outcomes of your intelligence products  What category of observables triggered the most alerts? How many threat bulletins resulted in a security investigation and subsequent uplift, and in what areas? </p><p>You may learn your biggest threat is something entirely different. Or, if you dont, at least the data validates your current assessment. Either way, this can help you drive your overall security strategy by supporting continued investment into existing focus areas or highlighting areas that may need more attention.</p>",
