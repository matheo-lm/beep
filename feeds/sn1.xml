					<description><![CDATA[Kristin Del Rosso &#038; Madeleine Devost explore the growing trend of foreign ownership of farmland and its implications for national security.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Who really owns America’s farmland, and why does it matter? In this deep dive into the secretive world of foreign investment in U.S. agricultural land, Kristin Del Rosso and Madeleine Devost explore the growing trend of foreign ownership, which has surged by 50% since 2017, and its profound implications for national security. Using the USDA’s data, the presenters shed light on how these investments could potentially impact everything from local economies to national defense.</p>
<p>The talk dives into the complexities of the USDA’s data collection methods, revealing how manual processes and outdated systems obscure the true extent of foreign ownership. It also discusses the critical role of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) in safeguarding national interests, and the urgent need for improved data sharing and automation between CFIUS and the USDA.</p>
<p>Through real-life examples, including controversial land purchases near sensitive military sites, Kristin and Madeleineillustrate the potential risks and propose actionable recommendations to enhance transparency and security.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Latest Ghostwriter campaign brings Belarusian opposition into its sights for the first time as it continues weaponizing XLS docs to drop malware.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">SentinelLABS has observed a campaign targeting opposition activists in Belarus as well as Ukrainian military and government organizations.</li>
<li aria-level="1">The campaign has been in preparation since July-August 2024 and entered the active phase in November-December 2024.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Recent malware samples and command-and-control (C2) infrastructure activity indicate that the operation remains active in recent days.</li>
<li aria-level="1">SentinelLABS assesses that this cluster of threat activity is an extension of the long-running Ghostwriter campaign identified in previous public reporting.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ghostwriter | Background</h2>
<p>Ghostwriter is a long-running campaign likely active since 2016 and subsequently described in various public reports throughout 2020 to 2024. The actor behind Ghostwriter campaigns is closely linked with Belarusian government espionage efforts, while most commonly reported under the APT names <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/unc1151-linked-to-belarus-government/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UNC1151</a> (Mandiant) or <a href="https://cert.gov.ua/search/UAC-0057" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UAC-0057</a> (CERT-UA). Some public reports may use the term &#8220;Ghostwriter APT&#8221; interchangeably to refer to both the threat actor and its associated campaigns.</p>
<p>Previous <a href="https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/2699483/Ghostwriter-Report-Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">research</a> on the evolution of Ghostwriter noted how it operated successfully across a range of platforms, blending information manipulation with hacking to target a number of European countries. Reporting throughout 2022 to 2024 described <a href="https://cert.gov.ua/article/6280159" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">activity</a> in which malicious Excel documents were used to deliver PicassoLoader and Cobalt Strike payloads. Observed document lures were themed around issues pertaining to the Ukraine military and the <a href="https://cyble.com/blog/unc1151-strikes-again-unveiling-their-tactics-against-ukraines-ministry-of-defence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">likely targeting</a> of the Ministry of Defense.</p>
<p>SentinelLABS has observed new activity with multiple weaponized Excel documents containing lures pertaining to the interests of the Ukraine government, the Ukraine military and domestic Belarusian opposition. While some of the TTPs we have observed overlap with previous reporting, others are new, including adaptations of previously observed payloads such as PicassoLoader.</p>
<h2>Weaponized XLS 1 | &#8220;Political Prisoners in Minsk Courts&#8221;</h2>
<p>SentinelLABS analyzed an attack that started with a Google Drive shared document landing in the target’s inbox. The email originated from an account using the name “Vladimir Nikiforech” (<code>vladimir.nikiforeach@gmail[.]com</code>). The email link pointed to a downloadable RAR archive, which according to the internal timestamps was created on 2025-01-14 00:47:54, containing a malicious Excel workbook (<code>ebb30fd99c2e6cbae392c337df5876759e53730d</code>) with the file name <code>политзаключенные(по судам минска).xls</code> (“Political prisoners (across courts of Minsk).xls”).</p>
<p>The title of the lure indicates an interesting shift in Ghostwriter targeting. Although attribution for the 2021 Ghostwriter campaign <a href="https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/2699483/Ghostwriter-Report-Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pointed to</a> the Belarus state, this is the first time we have seen lures directly aimed at Belarus government opposition. The timing of the attack could have been motivated by the presidential election that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Belarusian_presidential_election" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took place</a> shortly after on Jan 26, 2025.</p>
<p>The XLS document contains an obfuscated VBA macro which is activated when the document is opened and the user allows Office macros to run.</p>
<figure id="attachment_114850" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-114850" style="width: 1837px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_3.jpg" alt="Obfuscated macro inside the XLS spreadsheet" width="1837" height="752" class="size-full wp-image-114850" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_3.jpg 1837w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_3-300x123.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_3-1024x419.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_3-768x314.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_3-1536x629.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1837px) 100vw, 1837px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-114850" class="wp-caption-text">Obfuscated macro inside the XLS spreadsheet</figcaption></figure>
<p>On execution, the macro writes a file to <code>%Temp%\Realtek(r)Audio.dll</code>.</p>
<p>The DLL file is loaded with the following command line invocation:</p>
<pre>
C:\Windows\System32\regsvr32.exe /u /s "C:\Temp\Realtek(r)Audio.dll”
</pre>
<p>This starts the standard Windows process <code>regsvr32.exe</code>, which calls the <code>DllUnregisterServer</code> function implemented inside the DLL; the function then loads and executes the .NET assembly described next.</p>
<p>Analysis of <code>Dwnldr.dll</code> shows that it is a DLL file with a .NET assembly embedded inside. The file is protected with <a href="https://mkaring.github.io/ConfuserEx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ConfuserEx</a> &#8211; a publicly available tool that helps to obfuscate .NET programs and observed in previous Ghostwriter campaigns.</p>
<p>The DLL file hosts a payload that appears to be a simplified variant of PicassoDownloader, a malware family also linked to Ghostwriter activity. The internal filename (<code>Dwnldr.dll</code>) was previously used by the Ghostwriter threat actor; however, this variant bears only high-level similarities to previous versions, with significant changes to the underlying code, possibly to make it a cheaper and more expendable tool.</p>
<p>As a part of application protection provided by the obfuscator, the Downloader creates a copy of itself in memory, and then modifies it. It does so by decrypting additional code of the assembly. It also uses a clever evasion technique, altering its own PE header in memory and breaking internal links to the .NET assembly. This makes it impossible for security products to parse it as a .NET module.</p>
<p>During code execution, after the protection layer passes control to core functionality, the Downloader writes a decoy Excel workbook file to <code>%AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\temp.xlsx</code> and downloads additional file(s) from the Web.</p>
<p>The <code>temp.xlsx</code> decoy file (<code>18151b3801bd716b5a33cfc85dbdc4ba84a00314</code>) is immediately opened in Excel in an attempt to make the victim believe that it contains the original content of the <code>политзаключенные (по судам минска).xls</code> file.</p>
<figure id="attachment_114854" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-114854" style="width: 1999px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_11.jpg" alt="Decoy document containing lists of people with criminal charges, prosecutors’ and judges’ names" width="1999" height="803" class="size-full wp-image-114854" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_11.jpg 1999w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_11-300x121.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_11-1024x411.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_11-768x309.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_11-1536x617.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-114854" class="wp-caption-text">Decoy document containing lists of people with criminal charges, prosecutors’ and judges’ names</figcaption></figure>
<p>The spreadsheet contains the names of people with criminal charges along with the names of prosecutors and judges: content that invites the reader to believe it could be leaked from a government source. However, the information was already in the public domain and can be found on the website of a proscribed Belarusian human rights organization, <a href="https://prisoners.spring96.org/ru/list" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spring96</a>.</p>
<p>Once the decoy Excel file is opened, the Downloader attempts to fetch the next stage from the following URL:</p>
<pre>
https://everythingandthedog[.]shop/petsblog/2020/2/25/tips-for-taking-difficult-dogs-on-a-walk.jpg
</pre>
<figure id="attachment_114852" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-114852" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_13.jpg" alt="The JPG image file fetched from the C2" width="720" height="960" class="size-full wp-image-114852" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_13.jpg 720w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_13-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-114852" class="wp-caption-text">The JPG image file fetched from the C2</figcaption></figure>
<p>We note that the <code>.shop</code> top level domain was also reported in other Ghostwriter activity seen in 2024.</p>
<p>When the malware issues the HTTP request, it uses a hardcoded User-Agent string:</p>
<pre>
Mozilla/5.0 (<b>Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7</b>) AppleWebKit/555.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/97.0.4692.71 Safari/537.36
</pre>
<p>The fetched file (<code>8d2bb96e69df059f279d97989690ce3e556a8318</code>) is a benign JPEG file, originating from publicly available photo stock, with no extra payload or any hidden cave where code could be embedded. We confirmed that an identical file can be found online, located on a web site that is nearly identical to the one used by attackers. It would seem the attackers not only reused the JPG file contents from a legitimate website but also copied its original URL, changing only the top level domain:</p>
<pre>
https://www.everythingandthedog<b>.com</b>/petsblog/2020/2/25/tips-for-taking-difficult-dogs-on-a-walk.
</pre>
<p>Once the file is downloaded, it is renamed and then saved to <code>%APPDATA%\Roaming\Microsoft\SystemCertificates\CertificateCenter.dll</code>.</p>
<p>Later, it is registered to load during autostart by leveraging the Registry Run key:</p>
<pre>
HKCU\System\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\Microsoft Certificate Center
</pre>
<p>with its value pointing to expanded environment variable string:</p>
<pre>
rundll32.exe C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\SystemCertificates\CertificateCenter.dll,#1
</pre>
<p>This Registry entry makes <code>rundll32.exe</code> load the DLL and execute its exported function with ordinal 1 whenever a user logs on.</p>
<figure id="attachment_114847" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-114847" style="width: 1999px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_6.jpg" alt="Overview of the malware stages for Weaponized XLS 1" width="1999" height="1180" class="size-full wp-image-114847" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_6.jpg 1999w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_6-300x177.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_6-1024x604.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_6-768x453.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_6-1536x907.jpg 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-114847" class="wp-caption-text">Overview of the malware stages for Weaponized XLS 1</figcaption></figure>
<p>During our analysis we only observed the benign JPG file being downloaded. However, based on the code analysis, we believe that the real targets receive an actual DLL. We assume that such a targeted payload delivery process is carefully controlled by the attackers and that they deliver the payload only after confirming the requesting client&#8217;s profile (browser user agent, IP address of the client, and matching time of the operation window). <a href="https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/menace-unleashed-excel-file-deploys-cobalt-strike-at-ukraine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Research</a> in a previous campaign found that a Cobalt Strike payload was delivered to targets only if the host IP was located in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Given the timing and targeting of the attack, we hypothesized that it may not have been an isolated incident. Further research led us to discover other samples closely resembling Weaponized XLS 1, suggesting that multiple attacks using the same techniques had been planned or executed. The samples used in these suspected attacks are described below.</p>
<h2>Weaponized XLS 2 | Ukraine Gov “Anti-Corruption Initiative”</h2>
<p>A file bearing the Ukrainian name <code>Zrazok.xls</code> (“Sample.xls”) is an XLS file (<code>301ffdf0c7b67e01fd2119c321e7ae09b7835afc</code>) with an obfuscated VBA macro embedded. However, the script code and obfuscation technique are different from the case we discussed earlier.</p>
<p>For this script, the attackers used a popular obfuscator tool called <a href="https://github.com/sevagas/macro_pack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Macropack</a>, an open-source but seemingly abandoned project originally developed for red-teaming and penetration testing exercises.</p>
<figure id="attachment_114845" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-114845" style="width: 1837px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_8.jpg" alt="Macropack-obfuscated VBA macro found inside the spreadsheet" width="1837" height="752" class="size-full wp-image-114845" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_8.jpg 1837w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_8-300x123.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_8-1024x419.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_8-768x314.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_8-1536x629.jpg 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1837px) 100vw, 1837px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-114845" class="wp-caption-text">Macropack-obfuscated VBA macro found inside the spreadsheet</figcaption></figure>
<p>As in the previous case, once the macro code is executed, the .NET ConfuserEx-obfuscated Downloader DLL (written to <code>%AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\bruhdll32.dll</code>) is loaded with <code>rundll32.exe</code> and respective commandline arguments to run an exported function. After this, the new module drops a decoy XLS file and opens it with Excel.</p>
<figure id="attachment_114851" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-114851" style="width: 1790px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_2.jpg" alt="The decoy document prepared for a Ukrainian reader (an action plan for anti-corruption initiative in government organisations in Ukraine)" width="1790" height="1255" class="size-full wp-image-114851" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_2.jpg 1790w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_2-300x210.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_2-1024x718.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_2-768x538.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_2-1536x1077.jpg 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1790px) 100vw, 1790px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-114851" class="wp-caption-text">The decoy document prepared for a Ukrainian reader (an action plan for anti-corruption initiative in government organisations in Ukraine)</figcaption></figure>
<p>This module attempts to download the next stage from the following URL (unavailable at the time of writing):</p>
<pre>
https://sciencealert[.]shop/images/2024/11/black-hole-coronaxx.jpg
</pre>
<p>When the malware issues the HTTP request it uses a hardcoded User-Agent string that differs slightly from the previous case:</p>
<pre>
Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/97.0.4692.71 Safari/537.36
</pre>
<p>Notably, this file (<code>52e894acf0e14d27f8997d2174c1f40d6d87bba9</code>) was previously uploaded to <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/4497bb70ca95b115d7be403141e34f7fb06070b8dd6ccf034d9a71c1c48826e4/details" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VirusTotal</a> on December 19, 2024.</p>
<figure id="attachment_114846" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-114846" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_7.jpg" alt="Image file fetched from the malicious URL" width="1024" height="415" class="size-full wp-image-114846" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_7.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_7-300x122.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_7-768x311.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-114846" class="wp-caption-text">Image file fetched from the malicious URL</figcaption></figure>
<p>As with the previous case, the image file and its URL path appear to be copied from a public blog, published on Nov 16, 2024:</p>
<pre>
https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-reveal-the-shape-of-a-black-holes-corona-for-the-very-first-time
</pre>
<p>Again, the file name and the path on the malicious server were nearly identical to the legitimate one, with the actor changing only the top level domain from <code>.com</code> to <code>.shop</code>.</p>
<pre>
https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/black-hole-coronaxx.jpg
</pre>
<p>In this case, the downloaded file is expected to be an archive in a GZIP format. Once downloaded, the malware decompresses it and saves it to the following location:</p>
<pre>
%APPDATA%\Roaming\Microsoft\SystemCertificates\CertificateCenter.dll
</pre>
<p>It also creates an additional text config file at:</p>
<pre>
%APPDATA%\Roaming\Microsoft\SystemCertificates\config
</pre>
<p>The config file contains the following data:</p>
<pre>
&lt;Project xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003"&gt;
 &lt;PropertyGroup&gt;
  &lt;AssemblyName&gt;Certificate&lt;/AssemblyName&gt;
  &lt;OutputPath&gt;Bin\&lt;/OutputPath&gt;
 &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;
 &lt;ItemGroup&gt;
  &lt;Compile Include="CertificateCenter.dll" /&gt;
 &lt;/ItemGroup&gt;
 &lt;Target Name="Build"&gt;
  &lt;MakeDir Directories="$(OutputPath)" Condition="!Exists('$(OutputPath)')" /&gt;
  &lt;Csc Sources="@(Compile)" OutputAssembly="$(OutputPath)$(AssemblyName).exe" /&gt;
 &lt;/Target&gt;
&lt;/Project&gt;
</pre>
<p>The config file is used by the Downloader to execute <code>MSBuild.exe</code>, instructing it to build a new application:</p>
<pre>
C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\MSBuild.exe %AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\SystemCertificates\config
</pre>
<p>This suggests that the <code>CertificateCenter.dll</code> file is not a binary as the file extension would suggest but rather contains program source code. The command, if successful, produces an executable file in the following location:</p>
<pre>
%AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\SystemCertificates\Bin\Certificate.exe
</pre>
<p>and likely contains the next stage of the infection chain.</p>

<h2>Weaponized XLS 3 | &#8220;Supplies for Ukraine Armed Forces&#8221;</h2>
<p>A file bearing the Ukrainian name <code>Донесення 5 реч - зразок.xls</code> (“Report 5 items &#8211; sample.xls”) is an XLS file (<code>9d110879d101bcaec7accc3001295a53dc33371f</code>) hosting another VBA payload obfuscated with Macropack.</p>
<p>As in the previous cases, once the macro code is executed, the .NET ConfuserEx-obfuscated Downloader DLL (written to <code>%AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\bruhdll32.dll</code>) is loaded with <code>rundll32.exe</code> and respective commandline arguments to run an exported function. After this, the new module drops a decoy XLS file on disk and opens it with Excel.</p>
<figure id="attachment_114849" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-114849" style="width: 1989px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_4.jpg" alt="The decoy document prepared for a Ukrainian reader (a report template for the Ukrainian armed forces supplies)" width="1989" height="1256" class="size-full wp-image-114849" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_4.jpg 1989w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_4-300x189.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_4-1024x647.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_4-768x485.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_4-1536x970.jpg 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1989px) 100vw, 1989px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-114849" class="wp-caption-text">The decoy document prepared for a Ukrainian reader (a report template for the Ukrainian armed forces supplies)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Again, the malware uses the same payload retrieval technique and downloads a JPG file from yet another <code>.shop</code> domain:</p>
<pre>
https://cookingwithbooks[.]shop/images/qwerty.jpg
</pre>
<p>The URL is unavailable at the time of writing, but data from VirusTotal indicates that the downloaded file is identical to the black hole image described above in the Weaponized XLS 2 section. The malware logic is also identical with Weaponized XLS 2.</p>
<h2>Weaponized XLS 4 &amp; 5 | Variations on a Theme</h2>
<p>In addition to the previous findings, we discovered further related XLS files that were similarly weaponized. The files <code>Донесення 5 реч фонд зборів- зразок.xls</code> (“Report 5 items collection fund- sample.xls”; <code>2c06c01f9261fe80b627695a0ed746aa8f1f3744</code>) and <code>Додаток 8 реч новий.xls</code> (“Addition 8 items new &#8211; sample.xls”; <code>853da593d2a489c2bd72a284a362d7c68c3a4d4c</code>) were first uploaded from Ukraine in Feb 2025.</p>
<p>Both files contain a Macropack-obfuscated VBA macro; however, they differ in structure. Functionally, both drop a DLL to the previously noted path <code>%AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\bruhdll32.dll</code>.</p>
<p>Again, the DLL is loaded with <code>rundll32.exe</code> and respective command line arguments to execute an exported function. Next, the victim sees a decoy workbook open in Excel.</p>

<p>The decoys are similar and the obfuscation technique, code structure, and the embedded URL are common to both:</p>
<pre>
https://pigglywigglystores[.]shop/wp-content/themes/fp-wp-j-piggly-wiggly-nc/resources/images/logo/logo.png
</pre>
<p>The User-Agent string in the HTTP request, however, is different, with the operating system and architectures specified as “Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64”.</p>
<pre>
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/97.0.4692.71 Safari/537.36 Edg/97.0.1072.71
</pre>
<p>These variants of the malware also contain another embedded .NET DLL, internally referred to as LibCMD from the original filename <code>LibCMD.dll</code> (<code>4ae6b8adc980ba8a212b838f3ca6a9718d9a3757</code>). This is a small file, whose purpose is simply to start <code>cmd.exe</code> and connect to stdin/stdout.</p>
<p>The file contains a tampered PE link timestamp. It is never saved to disk; instead, it is loaded dynamically in memory as a .NET assembly and executed.</p>

<h2>Attribution</h2>
<p>Analysis of techniques used by threat actors can often be helpful in establishing the origin of the attack and the malware it uses. In this case, the obfuscation techniques are quite specific across all the samples we analyzed, allowing us to establish a medium confidence link between them and a malware cluster known as PicassoLoader, a downloader toolkit.</p>
<p>PicassoLoader has been used in cyber attacks targeting government, military, and civilian entities in Ukraine and Poland and is exclusively associated with the Ghostwriter threat actor (<i>aka</i> UNC1151, UAC-0057, Blue Dev 4, Moonscape, TA445).</p>
<p>Throughout 2024, Ghostwriter has repeatedly used a combination of Excel workbooks containing Macropack-obfuscated VBA macros and dropped embedded .NET downloaders obfuscated with ConfuserEx. In our case, the Downloader malware appears to be a simplified implementation of the PicassoLoader.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Ghostwriter threat actor has been consistently active in the past years and continues its attempts to compromise targets aligned with the interests of Belarus and its closest ally, Russia. It has mounted multiple attacks reported by CERT UA and other security researchers throughout 2024.</p>
<p>While Belarus doesn’t actively participate in military campaigns in the war in Ukraine, cyber threat actors associated with it appear to have no reservation about conducting cyberespionage operations against Ukrainian targets.</p>
<p>The campaign described in this publication also serves as confirmation that Ghostwriter is closely tied with the interests of the Belarusian government waging an aggressive pursuit of its opposition and organizations associated with it.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Data leak reveals how a top tier cybersecurity vendor helps the PRC enforce content monitoring and manipulation of public opinion in China.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">SentinelLABS has analyzed a data leak containing infrastructure details and work logs from employees of a state-affiliated private sector security firm in China.</li>
<li aria-level="1">The leaked data contains references to web content monitoring services used to enforce censorship for public and private sector customers.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Work logs reveal that the firm provided bespoke monitoring services to a state-owned enterprise when a corruption scandal impacted this organization, providing insights into how the state and CCP coordinate with some cybersecurity companies to manage fallout from corruption scandals.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>SentinelLABS has analyzed a data leak from TopSec (北京天融), a Chinese cybersecurity firm offering services such as Endpoint Detection &amp; Response (EDR) and vulnerability scanning, while offering boutique solutions to align with government initiatives and intelligence requirements.</p>
<p>The data leak includes a document with 7,000+ lines of work logs and code used to orchestrate infrastructure for the firm’s DevOps practices and downstream customers and includes scripts that connect to several Chinese government hostnames, academic institutions and news sites.</p>
<p>We identified work logs and system features that indicate TopSec is likely enabling content moderation for internet censorship purposes, a key <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/community-watch-chinas-vision-for-the-future-of-the-internet/">strategy</a> used by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to monitor and control public opinion on issues that the state deems contentious or antisocial.</p>
<p>Further, we found evidence indicating that TopSec provided bespoke services to a state-owned enterprise on the date that a corruption investigation was announced targeting the organization’s top official.</p>
<p>The Chinese cybersecurity market has long been a mystery for many researchers in the west. Unlike Europe and parts of the Middle East, which foster some degree of collaboration, the Chinese cybersecurity market is obscured behind the wall that divides China from the global internet. This finding reveals not only the types of technologies that are used by a prestigious Chinese tech firm, but how they are providing security services to private and public sector customers inside China.</p>
<h2>TopSec</h2>
<p>TopSec is a provider of monitoring and IT security solutions, as well as big data and cloud services. Established in 1995, TopSec prides itself on its long history and prioritizes national cyberspace security as a core element of its mission statement.</p>
<p>Company registration details reveal that TopSec holds over 1,000 patents, 87 software copyrights, and has 12 subsidiaries. The company is also a <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/sleight-of-hand-how-china-weaponizes-software-vulnerability/">Tier 1 vulnerability supplier</a> to China’s civilian intelligence ministry. According to TopSec&#8217;s 2024 annual corporate report for shareholders, the company has been offering cloud monitoring services–including IT security monitoring capabilities–since 2004. By 2020, these TopSec services were in use across all 31 of China’s administrative regions.</p>

<p>The leaked documents we analyzed reference multiple organizations in both the private and public sectors, likely customers or otherwise associated with TopSec, a selection of which is listed below. These references include probable deployment sites of monitoring probes and mentions in-work progress records.</p>
<p>Public sector organizations referenced in the documents include entities integral to China’s political system, such as the Municipal Commissions for Discipline Inspection, which enforce party regulations and investigate corruption. Another example is the Illegal and Harmful Information Reporting Center, an entity dedicated to combating what the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) considers illegal and harmful behavior in the online space. TopSec customers referenced in these documents include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dongwu Fund Management Co., Ltd</li>
<li>Gucheng County Petition Bureau</li>
<li>Illegal and Harmful Information Reporting Center</li>
<li>Linhai Rural Commercial Bank</li>
<li>Petkit</li>
<li>Shanghai Diepai Automobile Technology Co</li>
<li>Shanghai Fengyilong Electronic</li>
<li>Shanghai Medical Packaging Materials Factory</li>
<li>Shanghai Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection</li>
<li>Shanghai Municipal Supervisory Commission</li>
<li>Tibet Autonomous Region</li>
<li>Tibet Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China</li>
<li>Wuhu Discipline Inspection and Supervision Network</li>
</ul>
<p>We observed references to three projects associated with Bureaus of the Ministry of Public Security in the northeastern city of Dandong, as well as the Songjiang and Pudong districts of Shanghai, with the latter project referred to as the &#8220;Cloud Monitoring Service Project&#8221;. The Ministry of Public Security is responsible for maintaining public order and overseeing law enforcement and surveillance activities to ensure compliance with national regulations.</p>
<pre>
[2024-2025 Shanghai Public Security Bureau Pudong Branch Cloud Monitoring Service Project (Phase II)]
The statistics of events that occurred today are as follows:
Aggregated events: 883 Valid: 129 Invalid: 672 On-hand: 82
Single events: 5637 Valid: 187 Invalid: 2781 On-hand: 2669
In terms of event volume, it is basically the same as that of our competitors.
</pre>
<p>A public procurement announcement for the &#8220;Cloud Monitoring Service Project&#8221; suggests that it involves monitoring the security posture and content of websites under the Bureaus&#8217; jurisdiction, with alerts issued in case of security breaches or policy violations. TopSec was likely involved in the bidding process alongside competitor companies. Public documents, however, show TopSec did not win the contract.</p>

<h2>Infrastructure Features</h2>
<p>We identified this leak as a submission to a multi-scanner platform that fired off a rule that looks for common abuse activities associated with Kubernetes. The main file we analyzed (SHA-1: <code>1bccef07ad0348e326248fe321259e2bd8f8cf8b</code>) contains numerous work logs, which are a description of the work performed by a TopSec employee and the amount of time the task took, often accompanied by scripts, commands, or data related to the task.</p>
<figure id="attachment_114590" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-114590" style="width: 755px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_5.jpg" alt="Example of work logs from the file along with English translation" width="755" height="154" class="size-full wp-image-114590" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_5.jpg 755w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_5-300x61.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 755px) 100vw, 755px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-114590" class="wp-caption-text">Example of work logs from the file along with English translation</figcaption></figure>
<p>In addition to work logs, the leak contains many commands and playbooks used to administrate TopSec’s services via multiple common DevOps and infrastructure technologies that are used worldwide, including Ansible, Docker, ElasticSearch, Gitlab, Kafka, Kibana, Kubernetes, and Redis. There are many artifacts showing JSON data for web APIs used by TopSec services. There are also network configurations, SSH and port mapping commands with hardcoded credentials, which present a huge security risk should anyone obtain access to the environment–and would likely provide access to TopSec’s downstream customers as well.</p>
<figure id="attachment_114598" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-114598" style="width: 686px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_14.jpg" alt="Ansible commands from leaked file used to access infrastructure" width="686" height="190" class="size-full wp-image-114598" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_14.jpg 686w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_14-300x83.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-114598" class="wp-caption-text">Ansible commands from leaked file used to access infrastructure</figcaption></figure>
<p>The leaked file is very large, disorganized, and the formatting is inconsistent, which complicates analysis. It is highly likely that we have not identified all capabilities outlined in the leak. Our analysis approach focused on translating the Chinese language content, identifying known technologies, and identifying interesting references in the commands and API JSON artifacts, particularly those where there were upticks in work logs performed around specific dates documented in the work logs or web API data.</p>
<p>The data leak includes a file that starts with infrastructure management code, including some which initializes several Docker images to enable security monitoring related features. These containers run probes, which are likely used for network monitoring. We are unable to fully assess the capabilities of these containers without access to them. However, the containers are run with several flags such as <code>--privileged</code> and <code>--net host</code> that suggest deep access to the monitored data. This may indicate the probes inspect network traffic or perform privileged tasks in the deployment environment.</p>
<p>Deeper in the file, there are work logs which contain dates indicating when certain tasks were performed and notes from the TopSec staff who worked on specific infrastructure projects. One project referenced repeatedly is called Sparta or Sparda, with the spelling changing regularly. Notes from the TopSec staff indicate that Sparta handles sensitive word processing, an indication of censorship keyword monitoring.</p>
<p>On a technical level, Sparta is a framework that uses GraphQL APIs to receive content from downstream web applications. Work logs indicate that TopSec migrated from a system called Apollo, which is plausibly a reference to <a href="https://github.com/apollographql">Apollo-GraphQL</a>, an open-source framework offered by a company based in San Francisco. The work logs also indicate that Sparta is equipped to process Chinese language characters. This suggests that TopSec likely developed Sparta as an in-house solution that is tailored to the localized needs of TopSec’s customers and does not rely on a US-based solution.</p>
<p>Additionally, we observed a note indicating that detection alerts considered severe are likely distributed to internal teams via WeChat for prioritized handling. WeChat is a widely-used messaging and social media platform in China, known for its broad range of features, including messaging, social networking, and payment services. Its integration into daily life makes it an essential tool for communication and business operations within the country.</p>
<pre>
Severe monitoring events are sent to corporate WeChat
</pre>
<p>Since WeChat operates under Chinese regulations, there are significant implications regarding data privacy and government access. Under Chinese laws, such as the <a href="https://digichina.stanford.edu/work/translation-cybersecurity-law-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china-effective-june-1-2017/">Cybersecurity Law</a>, companies like Tencent, which owns WeChat, are required to cooperate with government entities, allowing them to access data when requested.</p>
<h2>Web Content Monitoring</h2>
<p>Our analysis found that TopSec’s capabilities include web content monitoring, as indicated by references to a service called <code>Website Monitoring Service</code> and detection events with internal identifiers prefixed with <code>Web</code>, such as <code>WebTamper</code>, <code>WebHiddenLink</code>, <code>WebAvailHttp</code>, <code>WebDns</code>, <code>WebTr</code>, and <code>WebSensitive</code>.</p>
<p>This feature of the platform is likely part of what would have been proposed in response to the bid issued by the Shanghai Pudong Bureau for the &#8220;Cloud Monitoring Service Project&#8221;, offering the Bureau tools to monitor website security and content as part of their broader surveillance and compliance efforts.</p>
<pre>
Inspect website monitoring-related services
[ . . . ]
[2024-06-12T18:00:00 to 2024-06-12T22:00:00 Event volume: 553] 2024-06-12T18:00:00 to 2024-06-12T22:00:00 Event volume: 553
WebSensitive 56
WebTamper 149
WebHiddenLink 348
</pre>
<p>While the exact logic behind how the Web events are triggered remains unclear, the event names and metadata present in the documents provide insight into the purpose of some of these events. For instance, the <code>WebAvailHttp</code> event is likely triggered when a website is considered unavailable due to its response time (measured in milliseconds as <code>respTimeMs</code> in the figure below) exceeding a predefined threshold (<code>respThresholdMs</code>).</p>
<figure id="attachment_114595" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-114595" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_17.jpg" alt="Metadata on the WebAvailHttp event" width="330" height="357" class="size-full wp-image-114595" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_17.jpg 330w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_17-277x300.jpg 277w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 330px) 100vw, 330px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-114595" class="wp-caption-text">Metadata on the <em>WebAvailHttp</em> event</figcaption></figure>
<p>Further, the <code>WebHiddenLink</code> event is likely triggered when web content contains hidden links — links that obscure their destination or mislead users, posing a security risk. Examples include links concealed within small or transparent elements, deceptive anchor text, and styling tricks that make links appear as plain text.</p>
<figure id="attachment_114601" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-114601" style="width: 423px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_11.jpg" alt="The WebHiddenLink event" width="423" height="92" class="size-full wp-image-114601" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_11.jpg 423w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_11-300x65.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 423px) 100vw, 423px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-114601" class="wp-caption-text">The <em>WebHiddenLink</em> event</figcaption></figure>
<h3>Web Content Monitoring | Sensitive Words</h3>
<p>The <code>WebSensitive</code> event is likely triggered when web content contains so-called <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2211695822000897">sensitive words</a> (敏感词 in Simplified Chinese). These words are related to political criticism, violence, or pornography, and are central to China&#8217;s domestic Internet censorship efforts aimed at ensuring compliance with government policies. Detecting the presence of such words in web content helps prevent the dissemination of information considered inappropriate or harmful by PRC authorities.</p>
<pre>
Assist the product to check for missed scans and manual analysis and marking errors of sensitive word events
</pre>
<p>TopSec’s ability to detect sensitive words demonstrates the impact that state policies related to the cyber domain have on the design and implementation of monitoring solutions developed by the private sector in China. These policies shape the strategies and technologies used to monitor, filter, and control online content, ensuring that IT systems comply with governmental regulations and censorship guidelines.</p>
<p><code>WebSensitive</code> alerts may be used by private sector organizations to monitor user-generated content on their websites in order to trigger actions such as issuing warnings, deleting content, or restricting access when sensitive words are detected. Government entities may also consume these alerts to track the presence of sensitive words on their own websites or across broader online spaces to enforce compliance with national censorship regulations. For example, the latter may have been an objective of the previously mentioned &#8220;Cloud Monitoring Service Project&#8221; by the Shanghai Pudong Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security.</p>
<p>We observed a task list indicating a focused effort to ensure consistent monitoring for sensitive words between 7:00 AM and 8:00 AM on the 14th (converted from GMT to China Standard Time), with the month and year not specified. The preceding document content suggests that the reference is to September 2023. One item in the task list instructs verification of the availability and capacity of sensitive word detection capabilities during this period, while another item records the forwarding of &#8216;asset identifiers&#8217; for collected &#8216;validated events&#8217; to an individual named Zhao Nannan (赵楠楠). The task list issuing this instruction very likely includes a typo stating the validated events were from 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM on September 14.</p>

2. 	Check the number of agents for sensitive words between 23:00 on the 13th (GMT) and 14:00 at 00:00 (排查敏感词13日23点到14点0点之间的代办数量) 2h
3. 	Check cloud baseline 500 errors 1h
4. 	Collect asset identifiers of valid events on the 13th and provide them to Zhao Nannan 1h
5. 	Check the task execution failure of ipv6 probe 1h

<p>The identification of an individual named Zhao Nannan as the likely recipient of this information, alongside the context of the monitoring effort, leads us to conclude with moderate confidence that this effort was in response to political events in Shanghai.</p>
<p>We identified a woman named Zhao Nannan as having worked at the 3rd Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security in Shanghai, which is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240622033538/https://www.trimps.ac.cn/gass/index.html">responsible</a> for network security and technical investigations. Our observations presented earlier in this post suggest close ties between Shanghai-based Bureaus of the Ministry of Public Security and TopSec, one example being TopSec&#8217;s participation in a project bidding process launched by the Shanghai Pudong Bureau.</p>

<p>However, Zhao Nannan no longer works for the MPS 3rd Bureau in Shanghai. According to an online announcement from the Shanghai State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), Zhao Nannan was one of six successful applicants to SASAC for a network security role. The announcement even references her past role at the MPS 3rd Bureau. Congratulations are due to her, as she scored the highest among the applicants for the role–恭喜!</p>

<p>On the morning of September 14th, when Zhao Nannan received alerts for sensitive content, her new employer announced on its WeChat account that the head of the Shanghai SASAC, Bai Tinghui, was under investigation for corruption. The news was quickly picked up by the South China Morning Post, Caixing, and other news-reposting blogs in China. The Shanghai government itself confirmed the investigation into Bai Tinghui and his subsequent dismissal one month later.</p>

<p>Because the Shanghai SASAC posted the news on WeChat, we know that the investigation itself was not subject to censorship. The lack of complete censorship regarding the investigation raises questions about what “validated events” would have been reported to Zhao Nannan following the announcement.</p>
<p>Currently, only five webpages of the Shanghai SASAC still mention Bai Tinghui. All five pages also mention Bai leading a Party study session of Xi Jinping Thought. It’s unclear why only these pages of Bai Tinghui remain–perhaps his tarnished reputation is outshown by Xi Jinping: it may be hard to delete a website with Xi Jinping’s name on it, even if it is accompanied by a corrupt local official.</p>
<figure id="attachment_114599" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-114599" style="width: 1088px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_13.jpg" alt="Search results that still show Bai Tinghui’s name on SASAC website" width="1088" height="1778" class="size-full wp-image-114599" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_13.jpg 1088w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_13-184x300.jpg 184w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_13-627x1024.jpg 627w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_13-768x1255.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_13-940x1536.jpg 940w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1088px) 100vw, 1088px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-114599" class="wp-caption-text">Search results that still show Bai Tinghui’s name on SASAC website</figcaption></figure>
<p>Intriguingly, the organization that is responsible for investigating the fallen Bai Tinghui, the Shanghai Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection, is listed among TopSec’s customers in the tooling.</p>
<p>The downfall of Bai Tinghui and the resulting use of Beijing TopSec’s tooling for coordinated monitoring of politically sensitive content shines a light on the important role cybersecurity companies can play in Chinese politics. The CCP has <a href="https://www.newamerica.org/cybersecurity-initiative/blog/chinas-strategic-thinking-building-power-cyberspace/">long-acknowledged</a> that “If our party cannot traverse the hurdle represented by the Internet, it cannot traverse the hurdle of remaining in power for the long term.” This episode provides a compelling example of how corruption investigations expand to rely on the institutions of those being investigated and the cybersecurity companies that service them.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>These leaks yield insight into the complex ecosystem of relationships between government entities and China’s private sector cybersecurity companies. While many countries have significant overlap between government requirements and private sector cybersecurity firms, the ties between these entities in China are much deeper and represent the state’s grasp on managing public opinion through online enforcement.</p>
<p>The September 2023 situation in Shanghai provides insight into how local and national government interests are enforced through private sector partnerships. The CCP’s strategy of controlling information is multifaceted and requires significant investment in resources that enable the monitoring and alteration of content that citizens engage with. While there are still many unknown factors regarding how such censorship is applied, these findings yield insights into how collaboration occurs between the government and other entities in China.</p>
<p>The nature of how this data was leaked remains unclear, but the materials show that TopSec engineers were documenting their work in a highly granular way that included entire commands used to perform the outlined tasks. Considering the types of information in this leak, organizations should evaluate how their systems and infrastructure engineers are logging work. Proper credential management is essential to securing sensitive environments. Infrastructure engineers should rely on a secrets manager that integrates with the CI/CD pipeline rather than running commands from playbooks that include hardcoded credentials. This results in only variable names being stored in commands instead of sensitive credentials and lowers the likelihood that an unexpected disclosure could result in further compromise.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[SentinelLABS has observed an active phishing campaign targeting high-profile X accounts to hijack and exploit them for fraudulent activity.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>An active phishing campaign is targeting high-profile X accounts in an attempt to hijack and exploit them for fraudulent activity.</li>
<li>This campaign has been observed targeting a variety of individual and organization accounts such as U.S. political figures, leading international journalists, an X employee, large technology organizations, cryptocurrency organizations, and owners of valuable, short usernames.</li>
<li>SentinelLABS’ analysis links this activity to a similar operation from last year that successfully compromised multiple accounts to spread scam content with financial objectives. While the activity detailed here is centered around X/Twitter accounts, this actor is not limited to a single social platform, and can be observed directing attention to other popular services as well, while seemingly pursuing the same financial objectives.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve encountered similar suspicious activity, SentinelLABS would love to hear from you — please reach out to the team at <a href="mailto:ThreatTips@sentinelone.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ThreatTips@sentinelone.com</a>.</p>
<h2>Account Compromise Process</h2>
<p>Thanks to tips from targets and collaboration with industry partners, SentinelLABS has observed a variety of phishing lures tied to this campaign over the past few weeks. One example is the classic account login notice. The links in the email received by the target are not legitimate and lead to credential phishing sites. Other observed lures use copyright violation themes. However, SentinelLABS notes that directly phishing users may not be the only access method employed by this attacker.</p>
<figure id="attachment_113633" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-113633" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-113633 size-full" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/new-login-phishing-email.jpg" alt="" width="760" height="1320" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/new-login-phishing-email.jpg 760w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/new-login-phishing-email-173x300.jpg 173w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/new-login-phishing-email-590x1024.jpg 590w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-113633" class="wp-caption-text">An X ‘new login’-themed phishing email</figcaption></figure>
<p>In recent cases, we observed the actor abusing Google&#8217;s &#8220;AMP Cache&#8221; domain <code>cdn.ampproject[.]org</code> to evade email detections and redirect the user to a phishing domain:</p>
<pre>https://cdn.ampproject[.]org/c/s/x-recoverysupport.com/reset/?username=[X-USERNAME]</pre>
<p>This ultimately leads the targets to an actor-made phishing website seeking X account credentials:</p>
<figure id="attachment_113632" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-113632" style="width: 684px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-113632 size-full" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/x-creds-phishing-page.jpg" alt="" width="684" height="792" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/x-creds-phishing-page.jpg 684w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/x-creds-phishing-page-259x300.jpg 259w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 684px) 100vw, 684px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-113632" class="wp-caption-text">X credential phishing page</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the copyright infringement lure scenario, the user will first visit an Action Needed page before being prompted to enter credentials:</p>
<figure id="attachment_113631" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-113631" style="width: 1514px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-113631" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/x-fake-copyright-infringement.jpg" alt="" width="1514" height="786" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/x-fake-copyright-infringement.jpg 1514w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/x-fake-copyright-infringement-300x156.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/x-fake-copyright-infringement-1024x532.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/x-fake-copyright-infringement-768x399.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1514px) 100vw, 1514px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-113631" class="wp-caption-text">X fake copyright infringement page</figcaption></figure>
<p>Once an account is taken over, the attacker swiftly locks out the legitimate owner and begins posting fraudulent cryptocurrency opportunities or links to external sites designed to lure additional targets, often with a crypto theft-related theme. Ultimately, compromising high-profile accounts enables the attacker to reach a broader audience of potential secondary victims, maximizing their financial gains.</p>
<h2>Widespread Activity</h2>
<p>In recent activity associated with this campaign, the domain <code>securelogins-x[.]com</code> has been used to deliver emails and <code>x-recoverysupport[.]com</code> to host phishing pages. Our observations indicate a level of informality and flexibility of infrastructure use – meaning any of these domains can be considered email delivery or phishing page hosting.</p>
<p>An overall collection of recent activity can be observed hosted on <code>84.38.130[.]20</code>, an IP associated with a Belize-based VPS service called Dataclub. The domains themselves have been predominantly registered through Turkish hosting provider Turkticaret.</p>
<p>Inspecting the DNS history of <code>84.38.130[.]20</code> leads to a variety of interestingly related domains. As shown below, the cluster of activity began in mid-2024 and continues today. While this is only one phishing page hosting IP, it provides a good perspective of the length of this activity and its ability to avoid much attention for over a year.</p>
<figure id="attachment_113630" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-113630" style="width: 1558px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-113630" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/validin-infrastructure-analysis.jpg" alt="" width="1558" height="886" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/validin-infrastructure-analysis.jpg 1558w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/validin-infrastructure-analysis-300x171.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/validin-infrastructure-analysis-1024x582.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/validin-infrastructure-analysis-768x437.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/validin-infrastructure-analysis-1536x873.jpg 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1558px) 100vw, 1558px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-113630" class="wp-caption-text">Validin Infrastructure Analysis Timeline</figcaption></figure>
<p>Our observations suggest that the attacker is highly adaptable, continuously exploring new techniques while maintaining a clear financial motive. The targeting appears constrained, yet opportunistic. Notably, past public reports have attributed related activity to Turkish-speaking actors based on language phishing page source comment language. At this time, we do not attribute this campaign to a specific country or any widely-tracked threat actor.</p>
<p>Some of the malicious sites and content hosted across <code>84.38.130[.]20</code> are built using the FASTPANEL DIRECT service.</p>
<figure id="attachment_113629" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-113629" style="width: 1046px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-113629" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/FASTPANEL-landing-page.jpg" alt="" width="1046" height="836" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/FASTPANEL-landing-page.jpg 1046w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/FASTPANEL-landing-page-300x240.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/FASTPANEL-landing-page-1024x818.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/FASTPANEL-landing-page-768x614.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1046px) 100vw, 1046px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-113629" class="wp-caption-text">FASTPANEL landing page on buy-tanai[.]com</figcaption></figure>
<p>FASTPANEL is a website hosting and building service that specializes in rapid building and management of websites. While FASTPANEL is not a malicious service, it is frequently abused by bad actors due to the ease of use, rapid scalability, and relatively low cost. FASTPANEL is routinely utilized by drainer gains and phishing campaigns, and is also included in associated guides and tutorials distributed throughout cybercrime communication channels.</p>
<figure id="attachment_113628" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-113628" style="width: 1556px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-113628" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/example-discussion-FASTPANEL.jpg" alt="" width="1556" height="664" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/example-discussion-FASTPANEL.jpg 1556w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/example-discussion-FASTPANEL-300x128.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/example-discussion-FASTPANEL-1024x437.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/example-discussion-FASTPANEL-768x328.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/example-discussion-FASTPANEL-1536x655.jpg 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1556px) 100vw, 1556px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-113628" class="wp-caption-text">Example discussion of FASTPANEL (RU crime forum)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Of the sites hosted on <code>84.38.130[.]20</code>, the <code>buy-tanai[.]com</code> and <code>emotionai[.]live</code> sites still present the FASTPANEL landing pages as of this writing.</p>
<h2>Publicly Linkable Activity</h2>
<h3>Emerging Account Intrusions</h3>
<p>While we have not yet established a high-confidence link, a recent compromise of a Tor Project account closely mirrors our observations. On January 30, 2025, the official X account for the Tor Project was breached. While it is possible that the same threat actor is responsible, we lack sufficient evidence to confirm the connection as of this writing.</p>
<figure id="attachment_113627" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-113627" style="width: 1534px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-113627" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/x-tor-project-potential-comp.jpg" alt="" width="1534" height="1018" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/x-tor-project-potential-comp.jpg 1534w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/x-tor-project-potential-comp-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/x-tor-project-potential-comp-1024x680.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/x-tor-project-potential-comp-768x510.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1534px) 100vw, 1534px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-113627" class="wp-caption-text">X post from The Tor Project account on January 30, 2025 advising users of a potential compromise</figcaption></figure>

<p>The Decentralized Autonomous Wireless Network (DAWN) was another victim of this type of attack. The threat actor <a href="https://coinpedia.org/news/dawn-internets-x-account-hacked-phishing-scams-target-users-via-telegram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leveraged</a> the compromised DAWN-related social media accounts to lure victims into entering credentials into phishing pages targeting X and Telegram credentials.</p>
<figure id="attachment_113625" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-113625" style="width: 1354px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-113625" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DAWN-x-post.jpg" alt="" width="1354" height="1358" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DAWN-x-post.jpg 1354w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DAWN-x-post-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DAWN-x-post-1021x1024.jpg 1021w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DAWN-x-post-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DAWN-x-post-768x770.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DAWN-x-post-50x50.jpg 50w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DAWN-x-post-24x24.jpg 24w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1354px) 100vw, 1354px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-113625" class="wp-caption-text">DAWN X Posts</figcaption></figure>
<p>The compromise of DAWN’s X accounts goes back to mid-January 2025.</p>
<figure id="attachment_113624" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-113624" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-113624" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DAWN-rewards-comp-post.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="1106" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DAWN-rewards-comp-post.jpg 960w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DAWN-rewards-comp-post-260x300.jpg 260w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DAWN-rewards-comp-post-889x1024.jpg 889w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DAWN-rewards-comp-post-768x885.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-113624" class="wp-caption-text">January 14, 2025 &#8211; DAWN rewards compromise post</figcaption></figure>
<h3>Crypto-Themed Project Placeholders</h3>
<p>In some cases, we’ve observed cryptocurrency themed projects seemingly acting as placeholders for future use, or direct pump-and-dump schemes. In one example, <code>buy-tanai[.]com</code> was <a href="https://pump.fun/coin/G8pMUeoRVVDQu2hJSzxNPBGWtgtt5BjQ9nCT2BmVpump" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pitched</a> as such: “<i>$TANA AI. Dawn&#8217;s AI project, Tana is the first AI-powered LP and trading agent, now live on the Solana blockchain.”</i></p>
<figure id="attachment_113623" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-113623" style="width: 1516px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-113623" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/tana-ai-pump-fun.jpg" alt="" width="1516" height="338" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/tana-ai-pump-fun.jpg 1516w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/tana-ai-pump-fun-300x67.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/tana-ai-pump-fun-1024x228.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/tana-ai-pump-fun-768x171.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1516px) 100vw, 1516px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-113623" class="wp-caption-text">Tana AI (TANA) on Pump[.]fun</figcaption></figure>
<p>The domain<code>buy-tanai[.]com</code> currently displays default FASTPANEL landing pages, suggesting it — along with other similar domains — is being staged for future attacks. Since FASTPANEL-managed sites can be rapidly updated, these domains serve as adaptable templates for phishing campaigns.</p>
<p>Notably, TANA AI (TANA) was launched by Dawn in mid-January to promote AI-driven trading and liquidity provision in the cryptocurrency market. Despite losing most of its initial value within days, the currency remains actively traded across multiple decentralized exchanges.</p>
<p>Given the crypto-related nature of these domains, it is likely that threat actors are using them as flexible phishing infrastructure. By keeping them as blank templates, they can quickly modify hosted content to align with ongoing campaigns as needed.</p>
<h3>Crimeware Relations</h3>
<p>Several other domains share overlaps in both use and unique infrastructure details, yet they represent a fork from the previously described high-profile social media profile attacks, including:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">dataoptimix[.]com</li>
<li aria-level="1">gamecodestudios[.]com</li>
<li aria-level="1">shortwayscooter[.]com</li>
</ul>
<p>The domain <code>shortwayscooter[.]com</code> <a href="https://x.com/JAMESWT_MHT/status/1883780543797723223" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hosts</a> fake captchas that deliver the DanaBot banking trojan. DataOptimix is branded as a generative AI solution, though there are few details about what the service does.</p>
<figure id="attachment_113622" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-113622" style="width: 1474px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-113622" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/dataoptimix.jpg" alt="" width="1474" height="1236" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/dataoptimix.jpg 1474w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/dataoptimix-300x252.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/dataoptimix-1024x859.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/dataoptimix-768x644.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1474px) 100vw, 1474px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-113622" class="wp-caption-text">DataOptimix</figcaption></figure>
<h3>Historical Connections</h3>
<p>In mid-2024, a campaign used related infrastructure in similar phishing messages, including those which <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/streamers/news-linus-sebastian-responds-linus-tech-tips-official-x-account-got-hacked" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">compromised the Linus Tech Tips</a> Twitter account along with several other high profile users. At the time, @LinusTech had roughly 1.8million followers, which may represent the highest profile account successfully hijacked and linked to this actor.</p>
<figure id="attachment_113621" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-113621" style="width: 852px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-113621" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/linus-tech-tips-compromise.jpg" alt="" width="852" height="1556" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/linus-tech-tips-compromise.jpg 852w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/linus-tech-tips-compromise-164x300.jpg 164w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/linus-tech-tips-compromise-561x1024.jpg 561w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/linus-tech-tips-compromise-768x1403.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/linus-tech-tips-compromise-841x1536.jpg 841w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 852px) 100vw, 852px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-113621" class="wp-caption-text">Linus Tech Tips Twitter compromise</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The cryptocurrency landscape offers financially-motivated threat actors multiple opportunities for profit and fraud. While marketing for coins and tokens has long been irreverent and meme-driven, recent developments have further blurred the line between legitimate projects and scams. </p>
<p>A striking example occurred in January 2025, when the X account of the late crypto-enthusiast and antivirus founder John McAfee was reactivated to promote a new coin, <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/john-mcafee-reborn-as-ai-memecoin-and-chatbot-with-27-million-market-cap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$AIntivirus</a>. The marketing style and brand voice of this purportedly legitimate token closely resemble tactics used in known scam campaigns, highlighting how easily crypto enthusiasts can be misled in an already murky ecosystem.</p>
<p>To safeguard your X account, we strongly recommend using a unique password, enabling two-factor authentication (2FA), and avoiding credential sharing with third-party services.

					<description><![CDATA[Chinese foreign direct investment should trigger American national security concerns, but much of it doesn’t. Elly Rostoum reveals why.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Chinese foreign direct investment should trigger American national security concerns, but much of it doesn’t. In this ‘behind closed doors’ talk at LABScon 24, Elly Rostoum reveals why and what can be done to improve our understanding of the influence of Chinese FDI.</span></p>
<p>Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) enabled the technology revolution in China and set China as a strategic competitor to the United States. It opened new global markets, redrew trade routes, tapped into intellectual property, allowed for opportunities in industrial espionage, reshaped supply chains, and allowed for technological breakthroughs in genomics, quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and other critical and emerging technologies that are quite simply re-imagining the world.</p>
<p>But who exactly owns the Chinese firms undertaking this FDI?</p>
<p>The research presented by <a href="https://www.labscon.io/speakers/elly-rostoum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elly Rostoum</a> in this LABScon 2024 keynote address tracks the incorporation structures and ownership of the 672 Chinese firms undertaking FDI globally.</p>
<p>Taking the audience on a journey from how Chinese FDI triggers &#8211; and sometimes fails to trigger &#8211;  American national security concerns to the complex ownership structure of Chinese businesses operating within the U.S., Elly Rostoum reveals how the Chinese government has been able to evade American national security reviews by instrumentalizing investment through 3rd &amp; 4th+ level subsidiaries, private equity, and holding companies.</p>
<p>While much policy and attention has been focused on the investments of Chinese state-owned enterprises, Elly Rostoum argues that the real threat is “within” and buried in the details: seemingly “American” businesses that are ultimately owned by Chinese investment companies.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Martin Wendiggensen reveals how disinformation shaped Taiwan’s election, and how AI-powered research uncovered hidden influences on voter behavior. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AI disinformation, deep fakes, armies of lying bots, and automated deception is the biggest threat to our elections, or so we’ve been told. But looking at Taiwan’s 2024 election, none of these nightmare scenarios materialized. The deafening silence of effective AI disinformation from China, America’s most advanced opponent, was surprising. Even more so given the focus on the election at the highest levels of the Chinese government.</p>
<p>In this highly-engaging talk, Martin Wendiggensen details how he set out to study the election and collected tens of thousands of hours of footage from YouTube and television as well as hundreds of thousands of news articles, blog posts, and social media content. This collection was then analyzed with a multi-modal AI pipeline. The results indicated that the small amount of AI-content received no engagement and had no impact.</p>
<p>Instead, Taiwanese billionaires earning most of their money in China mounted a concerted effort to buy or set up local news outlets in Taiwan in the run-up to the election. Conducting a large-scale analysis of these outlets’ output uncovered interesting results. Their viewership, numbering in the millions, presented slanted narratives aligned with the Beijing-friendly KMT and a new emergent third party. While losing the presidential election, these two parties managed to wrest control of Taiwan’s parliament and are set to have a major impact on the country’s foreign and domestic policies.</p>
<p>This presentation guides the audience through Chinese and local disinformation efforts in the Taiwanese election, highlighting the main lessons that can be drawn from them to safeguard future elections. Along the way, Martin explains the research methodology and toolbox that leverages open-source AI to fight disinformation.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Max Smeets explores how ransomware groups leverage public reporting and why we must disrupt the trust dynamic between threat actors and victims.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In his Keynote talk at LABScon 24, Max Smeets explores how ransomware operators build a unique relationship between themselves and their victims. In contrast to most other threat actors, ransomware operators rely on and leverage public visibility into their activities. Unlike APTs and other threat actors that prize stealth, ransomware gangs seek to publicize their attacks in order to convince future victims that they are trustworthy enough to deliver on their promises &#8211; providing a decryptor and deleting stolen data &#8211; if paid.</p>
<p>In &#8216;The Ransomware Trust Paradox&#8217;, Max observes that this notion of trust is not only a prerequisite for ransomware gangs&#8217; profitability but also relies on media and security vendor reporting. Detailing the mechanisms by which ransomware operators establish trust, build brand awareness, and foster a reputation for reliability, this talk is essential viewing for anyone reporting on crimeware activities.</p>
<p>Max calls for the establishment of a reporting code of ethics for threat intelligence and the media, and a shift in policy to undermine the trust dynamics between threat actors and their victims.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Kymberlee Price reveals the technical chaos facing SMBs as they struggle with solutions aimed at bigger fish in the face of expanding crimeware.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ransomware is doing more to change the security landscape than the last 20 years of Secure Development Lifecycle, DevSecOps, Zero Days, Breaches, or any corporate memo. Pair this with predatory pricing models from software vendors that sell security features as add-on products in premium or enterprise tier licenses, and you’ve got a perfect storm that hits small and medium sized businesses (SMBs) the hardest.</p>
<p>In this hard-hitting talk, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kymberleeprice/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kymberlee Price</a> reveals the technical chaos facing the US’s largest employment sector: SMBs. With restricted budgets, a lack of expertise, no access to consumer reports by which to clearly compare products, and a SaaS industry that makes basic security features like SSO a premium add-on, many businesses remain easy pickings for threat actors in a rapidly expanding crimeware landscape.</p>
<p>Why should we care about this, is it really a national threat, and what can a bunch of security engineers do about it?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Threat actors abused Visual Studio Code and Microsoft Azure infrastructure to target large business-to-business IT service providers in Southern Europe.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">From late June to mid-July 2024, a suspected China-nexus threat actor targeted large business-to-business IT service providers in Southern Europe, an activity cluster that we dubbed ‘Operation Digital Eye’.</li>
<li aria-level="1">The intrusions could have enabled the adversaries to establish strategic footholds and compromise downstream entities. SentinelLabs and Tinexta Cyber detected and interrupted the activities in their initial phases.</li>
<li aria-level="1">The threat actors used a lateral movement capability indicative of the presence of a shared vendor or digital quartermaster maintaining and provisioning tooling within the Chinese APT ecosystem.</li>
<li aria-level="1">The threat actors abused Visual Studio Code and Microsoft Azure infrastructure for C2 purposes, attempting to evade detection by making malicious activities appear legitimate.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Our visibility suggests that the abuse of Visual Studio Code for C2 purposes had been relatively rare in the wild prior to this campaign. Operation Digital Eye marks the first instance of a suspected Chinese APT group using this technique that we have directly observed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Tinexta Cyber and SentinelLabs have been tracking threat activities targeting business-to-business IT service providers in Southern Europe. Based on the malware, infrastructure, techniques used, victimology, and the timing of the activities, we assess that it is highly likely these attacks were conducted by a China-nexus threat actor with cyberespionage motivations.</p>
<p>The relationships between European countries and China are complex, characterized by cooperation, competition, and underlying tensions in areas such as trade, investment, and technology. Suspected China-linked cyberespionage groups <a href="https://cert.europa.eu/static/files/TLP-CLEAR-JointPublication-23-01.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">frequently</a> <a href="https://cert.europa.eu/publications/threat-intelligence/cb24-08/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">target</a> public and private organizations across Europe to gather strategic intelligence, gain competitive advantages, and advance geopolitical, economic, and technological interests.</p>
<p>The attack campaign, which we have dubbed Operation Digital Eye, took place from late June to mid-July 2024, lasting approximately three weeks. The targeted organizations provide solutions for managing data, infrastructure, and cybersecurity for clients across various industries, making them prime targets for cyberespionage actors.</p>
<p>A sustained presence within these organizations would provide the Operation Digital Eye actors with a strategic foothold, creating opportunities for intrusions across the digital supply chain and enabling them to exert control over critical IT processes within the downstream compromised entities. The attacks were detected and disrupted during their initial phases.</p>
<p>The exact group behind Operation Digital Eye remains unclear due to the extensive <a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/chinese-entanglement-dll-hijacking-in-the-asian-gambling-sector/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sharing</a> of malware, operational playbooks, and infrastructure management processes within the Chinese threat landscape. The threat actors used a pass-the-hash capability, likely originating from the same source as closed-source custom Mimikatz modifications observed exclusively in suspected Chinese cyberespionage activities, such as <a href="https://www.cybereason.com/blog/research/operation-soft-cell-a-worldwide-campaign-against-telecommunications-providers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Operation Soft Cell</a> and <a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/operation-tainted-love-chinese-apts-target-telcos-in-new-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Operation Tainted Love</a>. The malware and tooling used in these campaigns have been <a href="https://github.com/yt0ng/cracking_softcell/blob/main/Cracking_SOFTCLL_TLP_WHITE.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">linked </a>to several distinct Chinese APT groups. We collectively refer to these custom Mimikatz modifications as mimCN.</p>
<p>The long-term evolution and versioning of mimCN samples, along with notable features such as instructions left for a separate team of operators, suggest the involvement of a shared vendor or digital quartermaster responsible for the active maintenance and provisioning of tooling. This function within the Chinese APT ecosystem, corroborated by the <a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/unmasking-i-soon-the-leak-that-revealed-chinas-cyber-operations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I-Soon leak</a>, likely plays a key role in facilitating China-nexus cyberespionage operations.</p>
<p>The abuse of <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visual Studio Code</a> <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remote Tunnels</a> for C2 purposes is central to this campaign. Originally designed to enable remote development, this technology provides full endpoint access, including command execution and filesystem manipulation. Additionally, Visual Studio Code tunneling involves executables signed by Microsoft and Microsoft Azure network infrastructure, both of which are often not closely monitored and are typically allowed by application controls and firewall rules. As a result, this technique may be challenging to detect and could evade security defenses. Combined with the full endpoint access it provides, this makes Visual Studio Code tunneling an attractive and powerful capability for threat actors to exploit.</p>
<p>Tinexta Cyber and SentinelLabs have notified Microsoft about the abuse of Visual Studio Code and Azure infrastructure in connection with Operation Digital Eye.</p>
<h2>Infection Vector and Attack Progression</h2>
<p>The attackers used SQL (Structured Query Language) injection as an initial access vector to infiltrate Internet-facing web and database servers. <code>User-Agent</code> request headers in the web traffic logs we retrieved indicate that the attackers used the <a href="https://sqlmap.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sqlmap</a> tool to automate the detection and exploitation of SQL injection vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>To establish an initial foothold and maintain persistent access, the threat actors deployed a PHP-based webshell. Relatively simple in design and implementation, the webshell uses the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.assert.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">assert</a> function to execute attacker-provided PHP code. Its implementation does not resemble any other webshells we are familiar with. We track this webshell under the name PHPsert.</p>
<p>To disguise the files implementing PHPsert and attempt to evade detection based on filesystem activity, the attackers used custom names tailored to the infiltrated environments, making the filenames appear legitimate. This included using the local language and terms that aligned with the technological context of the targeted organizations.</p>
<p>After establishing an initial foothold, the threat actors conducted reconnaissance using a variety of third-party tools and built-in Windows utilities, such as <a href="https://joeware.net/freetools/tools/getuserinfo/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GetUserInfo</a> and <code>ping</code>. They also deployed the <code>local.exe</code> tool, which is part of the Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit and allows for viewing user group memberships.</p>
<p>To steal credentials, the attackers used the <code>CreateDump</code> tool to <a href="https://lolbas-project.github.io/lolbas/OtherMSBinaries/Createdump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extract</a> memory allocated to the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process and exfiltrate credentials. <code>CreateDump</code> is part of the Microsoft .NET Framework distribution. The threat actors also retrieved credentials from the Security Account Manager (SAM) database, which they extracted from the Windows Registry using the <code>reg save</code> <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/reg-save" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">command</a>.</p>
<p>The threat actors frequently named the files they deployed using the pattern <code>do.*</code>. Examples include <code>do.log</code> (output from <code>ping</code> commands), <code>do.exe</code> (the <code>CreateDump</code> tool), and <code>do.bat</code> (a script that executes and deletes the <code>CreateDump</code> executable).</p>
<p>From the initially compromised endpoints, the attackers moved laterally across the internal network, primarily using RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) connections and pass-the-hash techniques. For the pass-the-hash attacks, they used a custom modified version of Mimikatz, implemented in an executable named <code>bK2o.exe</code>.</p>
<p>In addition to the PHPsert webshell, the threat actors used two methods for remote command execution: SSH access, enabled by deploying <code>authorized_keys</code> files containing public keys for authentication, and Visual Studio Code Remote Tunnels.</p>
<p>Visual Studio Code Remote Tunnels, based on Microsoft’s <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dev tunnel</a> technology, enable developers to access and work on remote systems. This access includes the command terminal and file system, allowing activities such as command execution and file editing. The Operation Digital Eye actors abused this functionality to maintain persistent backdoor access to compromised systems.</p>
<p>In an attempt to evade detection based on filesystem activity, the threat actors used <code>%SystemRoot%\Temp</code> and <code>%ProgramData%\Visual Studio Code</code> as their primary working directories for storing tools and data. <code>%SystemRoot%\Temp</code> is a directory where Windows stores temporary files and is often monitored with less scrutiny. <code>%ProgramData%\Visual Studio Code</code> was intended to appear as a legitimate directory associated with Visual Studio Code.</p>
<p>The intrusions were detected and interrupted before the attackers could proceed to further phases, such as exfiltrating data.</p>
<h2>Abuse of Visual Studio Code</h2>
<p>The threat actors deployed a portable Visual Studio Code executable named <code>code.exe</code>, which is digitally signed by Microsoft, and used the <a href="https://github.com/winsw/winsw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">winsw</a> tool to run it as a Windows service. The <code>winsw</code> configuration file we retrieved indicates that the attackers created a service named <code>Visual Studio Code Service</code>, which executes <code>code.exe</code> with the <code>tunnel</code> command-line parameter at every system startup.</p>
<p>The configuration file reveals a pragmatic approach by the threat actors, who likely modified a <a href="https://github.com/winsw/winsw/blob/v3/samples/complete.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">publicly available</a> <code>winsw</code> configuration. This is suggested by the use of the <code>myapp</code> service identifier and the <code>%BASE%\logs</code> directory for storing <code>winsw</code> log files, both of which appear in the public configuration file as well as in the one we retrieved.</p>

<p>The <code>tunnel</code> parameter instructs Visual Studio Code to create a dev tunnel and act as a server to which remote users can connect. After <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/security" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">authenticating</a> to the tunnel with a Microsoft or GitHub account, remote users can access the endpoint running the Visual Studio Code server, either through the Visual Studio Code desktop application or the browser-based version, <a href="https://vscode.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vscode.dev</a>.</p>
<p>After creating the dev tunnels, the threat actors authenticated using GitHub accounts and accessed the compromised endpoints through the browser-based version of Visual Studio Code. We have no knowledge of whether the threat actors used self-registered or compromised GitHub accounts to authenticate to the tunnels.</p>
<h2>Network Infrastructure</h2>
<p>The Operation Digital Eye actors used infrastructure located exclusively within Europe, sourced from the provider M247 and the Cloud platform Microsoft Azure. This was likely part of a deliberate strategy. Since the targeted organizations are based and operate within Europe, the attackers may have aimed to minimize suspicion by aligning their infrastructure&#8217;s location with that of their targets. Additionally, Cloud infrastructure commonly used in legitimate IT workflows, such as Microsoft Azure, is often not closely monitored and is frequently allowed through firewall restrictions. By leveraging public Cloud infrastructure for malicious purposes, the attackers made the traffic appear legitimate, which can be challenging to detect and may evade security defenses.</p>
<p>In the initial phases of the attacks, the threat actors used the server with IP address <code>146.70.161[.]78</code> to establish initial access by detecting and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities, and the server with IP address <code>185.76.78[.]117</code> to operate the PHPsert webshell. Both IP addresses are allocated to the infrastructure provider M247 and are located in Poland and Italy, respectively.</p>
<p>In the later phases of the attacks, the threat actors used the server with IP address <code>4.232.170[.]137</code> for C2 purposes when remotely accessing compromised endpoints via the SSH protocol. This server is part of Microsoft&#8217;s Azure infrastructure in the <code>Italy North</code> <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/regions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">datacenter region</a> (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56519" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure IP range</a>: <code>4.232.128[.]0/18</code>, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/service-tags-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">service tag</a>: <code>AzureCloud.italynorth</code>). We currently have no information on whether the threat actors used self-registered or compromised Azure credentials to access and manage the Azure resources and services.</p>
<p>The abuse of Visual Studio Code tunneling for C2 purposes also relies on Microsoft Azure infrastructure. Creating and hosting a dev tunnel requires connecting to a Microsoft Azure server with a domain of <code>*.[clusterID].devtunnels.ms</code>, where <code>[clusterID]</code> corresponds to the Azure region of the endpoint running the Visual Studio Code server, <a href="https://global.rel.tunnels.api.visualstudio.com/api/v1/clusters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">such as</a> <code>euw</code> for <code>West Europe</code>. In Operation Digital Eye, the creation of dev tunnels involved establishing connections to the server with the domain <code>[REDACTED].euw.devtunnels[.]ms</code>, which resolved to the IP address <code>20.103.221[.]187</code>. This server is part of Microsoft&#8217;s Azure infrastructure in the <code>West Europe</code> datacenter region (Azure IP range: <code>20.103.0[.]0/16</code>, service tag: <code>AzureCloud.westeurope</code>).</p>
<h2>The PHPsert Webshell</h2>
<p>PHPsert executes attacker-provided PHP code using the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.assert.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">assert</a> function, which, in PHP versions prior to 8.0.0, interprets and runs parameter strings as PHP code. To hinder static analysis and evade detection, the webshell uses various code obfuscation techniques, including XOR encoding, hexadecimal character representation, string concatenation, and randomized variable names.</p>
<figure id="attachment_109540" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-109540" style="width: 664px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye3.jpg" alt="PHPsert implementation" width="664" height="434" class="size-full wp-image-109540" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye3.jpg 664w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye3-300x196.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 664px) 100vw, 664px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-109540" class="wp-caption-text">PHPsert implementation</figcaption></figure>
<p>The PHPsert webshell operates as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">PHPsert instantiates a class with a single regular method, which XOR-decodes and concatenates hexadecimal characters to generate the string <code>assert</code>. The class&#8217;s destructor (the magic method <code>__destruct</code>) uses this string to invoke the <code>assert</code> function, passing attacker-provided PHP code as a parameter.</li>
<li aria-level="1">The webshell retrieves the attacker-provided PHP code from an HTTP POST request parameter, for example, <code>momomomo</code>. If the <code>id</code> parameter is present in the request URL, PHPsert decodes the Base64-encoded value of the POST parameter. If the <code>id</code> parameter is absent, the webshell uses the raw value of the parameter.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Finally, when PHPsert finishes executing, the class&#8217;s destructor is invoked, which in turn calls the <code>assert</code> function to execute the attacker-provided PHP code.</li>
</ul>
<p>We identified multiple PHPsert variants, which have been submitted to malware sharing platforms since May 2023, from various locations including Japan, Singapore, Peru, Taiwan, Iran, Korea, and the Philippines. These variants show only minor differences in their implementation, such as varying variable names and POST request parameters like <code>mr6</code>, <code>brute</code>, and <code>qq</code>. Our analysis suggests that PHPsert is deployed not only as a standalone PHP file but is also integrated into various types of web content, including web text editors and content management systems.</p>
<p>One of the PHPsert variants contains commented-out code snippets and comments in simplified Chinese that describe nearby code. These comments and snippets are not present in the PHPsert versions observed in Operation Digital Eye, nor in any of the webshell’s other variants. Below are the code comments, all of which are machine-translated from simplified Chinese:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><code>结果是"assert"</code>, which translates to <code>The result is "assert"</code>.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><code>验证 $this->rg 是否安全</code>, which translates to <code>Verify that $this->rg is safe</code>.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><code>验证和清理用户输入</code>, which translates to <code>Validating and sanitizing user input</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The presence of these comments, along with the indicators of removed code across PHPsert variants, suggests the potential involvement of Chinese-speaking developers who may have been simplifying the webshell&#8217;s execution logic.</p>
<h2>Pass-the-Hash Capability</h2>
<p>The <code>bK2o.exe</code> executable (a custom modified version of Mimikatz used in Operation Digital Eye for pass-the-hash attacks) enables the execution of processes within a user&#8217;s security context by leveraging a compromised NTLM password hash, bypassing the need for the user’s actual password. To achieve this, <code>bK2o.exe</code> overwrites memory of the LSASS process. The tool supports the following command-line parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><code>/c</code>: The process to execute; defaults to <code>cmd.exe</code> if not provided.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><code>/u</code>: The user’s username.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><code>/d</code>: The user’s domain.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><code>/h</code>: The NTLM password hash.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>bK2o.exe</code> implements a pass-the-hash technique by overwriting LSASS memory in a manner similar to Mimikatz, with its implementation partially overlapping with Mimikatz functions such as <code>kuhl_m_sekurlsa_pth_luid</code> and <code>kuhl_m_sekurlsa_msv_enum_cred_callback_pth</code>. In summary, <code>bK2o.exe</code> performs the following:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-createprocesswithlogonw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Creates</a> a suspended process in a new logon session, specifying the attacker-provided process, username, domain, and an empty password.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Based on the session’s locally unique identifier (LUID), locates and extracts from the LSASS process memory an encrypted credential data blob containing the user’s NTLM hash and the encryption keys required to decrypt the blob.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Decrypts the data blob, overwrites the user’s NTLM hash with the attacker-provided hash, and re-encrypts the data blob.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Resumes the suspended process.</li>
</ul>

<p>To navigate LSASS memory, <code>bK2o.exe</code> uses code signatures, represented as byte sequences in hexadecimal format. These sequences correspond to known LSASS instructions, which serve as navigation points within the memory.</p>
<p>To hinder static analysis and evade detection, <code>bK2o.exe</code> obfuscates code signatures and strings by constructing them dynamically on the stack at runtime, instead of storing them as static data.</p>
<figure id="attachment_109542" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-109542" style="width: 382px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye17.jpg" alt="bK2o.exe constructs the string lsasrv.dll on the stack" width="382" height="181" class="size-full wp-image-109542" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye17.jpg 382w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye17-300x142.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 382px) 100vw, 382px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-109542" class="wp-caption-text">bK2o.exe constructs the string lsasrv.dll on the stack</figcaption></figure>

<h2>From Operation Digital Eye to Tainted Love and Soft Cell</h2>
<p>We identified two additional samples uploaded to malware sharing platforms that construct code signatures on the stack, which we refer to as <code><code>wsx1.exe</code></code> and <code>wsx1.exe</code>. Like <code>bK2o.exe</code>, both <code>wsx.exe</code> and <code>wsx1.exe</code> are custom modified versions of Mimikatz and implement pass-the-hash functionality.</p>
<p>Substantial code segments in <code>wsx.exe</code> and <code>wsx1.exe</code>, which implement the construction of code signatures on the stack, overlap with those in <code>bK2o.exe</code>, including identical <code>mov</code> instruction operand sizes and values. This suggests that <code>wsx.exe</code>, <code>wsx1.exe</code>, and <code>bK2o.exe</code> are highly likely derived from the same source.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_109549" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-109549" style="width: 442px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye10.jpg" alt="Code segment in bK2o.exe" width="442" height="542" class="size-full wp-image-109549" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye10.jpg 442w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye10-245x300.jpg 245w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-109549" class="wp-caption-text">Code segment in bK2o.exe</figcaption></figure><br />

<p>In turn, we observed overlaps between <code>wsx.exe</code>, <code>wsx1.exe</code>, and mim221 components. mim221 is a versioned and well-maintained credential theft tool, also a custom modified version of Mimikatz, which SentinelLabs observed in <a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/operation-tainted-love-chinese-apts-target-telcos-in-new-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Operation Tainted Love</a> — a campaign targeting telecommunication providers in the Middle East in 2023.</p>
<p>We attributed Operation Tainted Love to a suspected Chinese cyberespionage group within the nexus of Granite Typhoon (formerly known as Gallium) and APT41, while acknowledging the possibility of tool sharing among Chinese state-sponsored threat actors and the potential involvement of a shared vendor or digital quartermaster. We assess that mim221 represents an evolution of tooling <a href="https://www.cybereason.com/blog/research/deadringer-exposing-chinese-threat-actors-targeting-major-telcos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">associated</a> with <a href="https://www.cybereason.com/blog/research/operation-soft-cell-a-worldwide-campaign-against-telecommunications-providers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Operation Soft Cell</a>, such as <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/65ea5f7750f44d98f1077397b906b2611781579a2ae6def44a4de5b41265a9b9/details" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">simplify_32.exe</a>. Operation Soft Cell, which targeted telecommunication providers in 2017 and 2018, has been <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-warns-of-gallium-threat-group-attacking-global-telcos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">linked</a> to Granite Typhoon, and possible <a href="https://github.com/yt0ng/cracking_softcell/blob/main/Cracking_SOFTCLL_TLP_WHITE.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">connections</a> between the Soft Cell actors and APT41 have also been suggested.</p>
<p>mim221 has a multi-component architecture, with a single executable staging three components — <code>pc.dll</code>, <code>AddSecurityPackage64.dll</code>, and <code>getHashFlsa64.dll</code> — using techniques such as decryption, injection, and reflective image loading. These components share several overlaps with <code>bK2o.exe</code>, <code>wsx.exe</code>, and <code>wsx1.exe</code>.</p>
<p>To hinder static analysis, some mim221 components also obfuscate strings by constructing them on the stack at runtime. Additionally, the mim221 components <code>AddSecurityPackage64.dll</code> and <code>getHashFlsa64.dll</code> implement error logging similar to that of <code>wsx.exe</code> and <code>wsx1.exe</code>, including identical custom error messages, a consistent output format, and the same English-language errors.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_109534" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-109534" style="width: 311px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye9.jpg" alt="Error messages in mim221" width="311" height="110" class="size-full wp-image-109534" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye9.jpg 311w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye9-300x106.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 311px) 100vw, 311px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-109534" class="wp-caption-text">Error messages in mim221</figcaption></figure><br />

<p>In addition, RTTI (Run-Time Type Information) information stored in <code>wsx.exe</code>, <code>wsx1.exe</code>, and the mim221 component <code>getHashFlsa64.dll</code> reveals that classes with the same names are declared across these executables. We have not observed these class names in open-source or publicly available tooling.</p>

<h2>mimCN | A Collection of China-Nexus APT Tools</h2>
<p>Due to the previously discussed overlaps between <code>bK2o.exe</code> (used in Operation Digital Eye), <code>wsx.exe</code>, <code>wsx1.exe</code>, mim221 components (used in Operation Tainted Love), and <code>simplify_32.exe</code> (used in Operation Soft Cell), we collectively refer to this collection of tools as mimCN.</p>
<figure id="attachment_109543" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-109543" style="width: 1999px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye16.jpg" alt="The mimCN samples bK2o.exe, wsx.exe, wsx1.exe, and mim221" width="1999" height="895" class="size-full wp-image-109543" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye16.jpg 1999w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye16-300x134.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye16-1024x458.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye16-768x344.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye16-1536x688.jpg 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-109543" class="wp-caption-text">The mimCN samples bK2o.exe, wsx.exe, wsx1.exe, and mim221</figcaption></figure>
<p>We include in the mimCN tool collection not only the previously mentioned tools but also any other custom modifications of Mimikatz that have overlaps with other mimCN executables, suggesting they may originate from the same source. Such overlaps include shared code-signing certificates and the use of unique custom error messages or obfuscation techniques.</p>
<p>To date, we have observed mimCN tools exclusively in the context of suspected Chinese APT activities. Although the compilation timestamps of the mimCN samples observed in these intrusions could have been manipulated, the proximity of the timestamps to when the activities occurred suggests that they are likely authentic.</p>

<p>Further, unique usage instructions found in some mimCN samples, such as <code>[ERROR]Please input command. eg, /cmd:xxx</code>  and <code>[ERROR]Please input ip. eg, /ip:xx.XXX.xx.x or /ip:xxx.com</code>, suggest the involvement of a dedicated development team that is leaving instructions for a separate group of operators. Combined with the presence of overlapping mimCN samples across various intrusions attributed to China-nexus APT groups and distributed over years, this suggests that mimCN is likely the product of an entity responsible for maintaining and provisioning tools to multiple clusters within the Chinese APT ecosystem.</p>
<h2>Attribution Analysis</h2>
<p>We assess that Operation Digital Eye was highly likely conducted by a China-nexus cluster with cyberespionage motivations. The specific group responsible remains unclear due to the extensive sharing of malware, operational playbooks, and infrastructure management processes among Chinese APT clusters. Our assessment is based on a collective consideration of multiple indicators, including the malware, infrastructure, and techniques used, victimology, and the timing of the activities.</p>
<h3>Malware</h3>
<p>A variant of the PHPsert webshell contains code comments in simplified Chinese. This suggests the potential involvement of Chinese-speaking developers. Further, the custom Mimikatz modification <code>bK2o.exe</code> used in Operation Digital Eye is part of the mimCN collection and shares implementation overlaps with other custom Mimikatz modifications, suggesting a common origin. These tools have been observed exclusively in the context of suspected Chinese APT activities, such as <a href="https://www.cybereason.com/blog/research/operation-soft-cell-a-worldwide-campaign-against-telecommunications-providers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Operation Soft Cell</a> and <a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/operation-tainted-love-chinese-apts-target-telcos-in-new-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Operation Tainted Love</a>. Malware and tooling used in these operations have been associated with the suspected Chinese APT groups Granite Typhoon and APT41, and <a href="https://github.com/yt0ng/cracking_softcell/blob/main/Cracking_SOFTCLL_TLP_WHITE.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">possible connections</a> to other China-nexus groups, such as APT10 and Lucky Mouse have also been suggested.</p>
<p>The mimCN tool collection suggests the presence of a shared vendor or digital quartermaster responsible for the sustained development and provisioning of tools to groups within the Chinese APT ecosystem. This function is <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2023-1107.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">suspected</a> to play a significant role in the Chinese threat landscape. The <a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/unmasking-i-soon-the-leak-that-revealed-chinas-cyber-operations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I-Soon leak</a>, which offers rare insight into China’s cyberespionage activities, provides supporting evidence for the existence of digital quartermasters within this landscape.</p>
<h3>Infrastructure</h3>
<p>While not exclusive to Chinese APT groups, the use of M247 infrastructure, as seen in Operation Digital Eye, has been common among them in recent years. One example is the <a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/sandman-apt-china-based-adversaries-embrace-lua/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">M247 infrastructure attributed</a> to the suspected Chinese cluster STORM-0866 (also known as Red Dev 40), with which the <a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/sandman-apt-a-mystery-group-targeting-telcos-with-a-luajit-toolkit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sandman APT group</a> is associated.</p>
<p>Additionally, the use of Cloud services and resources located in geographic proximity to the targeted organizations in Operation Digital Eye suggests a carefully planned and targeted infrastructure management approach. In this context, we suspect the potential involvement of third-party entities tasked with administering and provisioning infrastructure, a practice that has become <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/china-nexus-espionage-orb-networks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">increasingly common</a> in the Chinese APT ecosystem in recent years.</p>
<h3>Abuse of Visual Studio Code</h3>
<p>Our visibility into threat actor activities suggests that the abuse of Visual Studio Code tunneling for C2 purposes was relatively rare in the wild before Operation Digital Eye.</p>
<p>Previous <a href="https://venturebeat.com/security/crowdstrike-2024-report-exposes-north-koreas-covert-workforce-in-u-s-tech-firms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">research</a> indicates that, starting in 2023, a suspected North Korean group has used Visual Studio Remote Tunnels to maintain persistence in compromised networks. Additionally, in October 2024, Cyble released a <a href="https://cyble.com/blog/silent-intrusion-unraveling-the-sophisticated-attack-leveraging-vs-code-for-unauthorized-access/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a> documenting unattributed activity in which threat actors distributed a <a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/who-needs-macros-threat-actors-pivot-to-abusing-explorer-and-other-lolbins-via-windows-shortcuts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows Shortcut</a> (LNK) file to deploy Visual Studio Code and activate its tunneling feature to establish remote access.</p>
<p>As of this writing, the only publicly disclosed use of this technique around the time of Operation Digital Eye has been attributed to a suspected Chinese APT group. In September 2024, Unit 42 published a <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/stately-taurus-abuses-vscode-southeast-asian-espionage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a> on a campaign targeting government entities in Southeast Asia, in which threat actors used Visual Studio Code as a backdoor. The campaign was attributed to Stately Taurus (also known as Mustang Panda). The exact timeline of the campaign is unclear, with mid-August 2024 being the only reference point explicitly mentioned in the Unit 42 report. Based on this, we suspect that Operation Digital Eye occurred prior to this activity.</p>
<p>We did not observe any overlaps in TTPs between Operation Digital Eye and the activity reported by Unit 42, except for the abuse of Visual Studio Code. We recognize the possibility that distinct Chinese APT clusters may share operational playbooks that include leveraging Visual Studio Code for C2 purposes.</p>
<h3>Temporal Analysis</h3>
<p>Our analysis of timestamps marking the dates and times of operator activity in the targeted organizations showed that all activities occurred on workdays (Monday to Friday). Additionally, converting the timestamps from their original time zones, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and Central European Summer Time (CEST, UTC+2), to China Standard Time (CST, UTC+8) revealed that the operators were primarily active during typical working hours in China, mostly between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. CST.</p>
<p>This suggests a potentially state-sanctioned operation. The &#8216;996&#8217; work schedule (9 a.m. to 9 p.m. CST, six days a week) has been common in China’s technology sector, but it was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinese-authorities-say-overtime-996-policy-is-illegal-2021-08-27/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ruled illegal</a> by the Supreme People&#8217;s Court in 2021. As a result, state employees are almost certainly restricted to weekday work, typically between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m., aligning closely with our observations from the timestamp analysis.</p>
<p>The figure below shows the total number of connections established by the threat actors to Visual Studio Code tunnels throughout Operation Digital Eye, broken down by hour of the day. The data is presented in both the original time zone (CEST) and in China Standard Time (CST, CEST+6). We observed minimal to no activity between 10 p.m. and 9 a.m. CST, as well as between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. CST, which aligns with the typical daily working hours in China, including the midday lunch break.</p>
<figure id="attachment_109536" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-109536" style="width: 1999px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye7.jpg" alt="Number of established connections to Visual Studio Code tunnels" width="1999" height="704" class="size-full wp-image-109536" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye7.jpg 1999w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye7-300x106.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye7-1024x361.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye7-768x270.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye7-1536x541.jpg 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-109536" class="wp-caption-text">Number of established connections to Visual Studio Code tunnels</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Operation Digital Eye highlights the persistent threat posed by Chinese cyberespionage groups to European entities, with these threat actors continuing to focus on high-value targets. The campaign underscores the strategic nature of this threat, as breaching organizations that provide data, infrastructure, and cybersecurity solutions to other industries gives the attackers a foothold in the digital supply chain, enabling them to extend their reach to downstream entities.</p>
<p>The abuse of Visual Studio Code Remote Tunnels in this campaign illustrates how Chinese APT groups often rely on practical, solution-oriented approaches to evade detection. By leveraging a trusted development tool and infrastructure, the threat actors aimed to disguise their malicious activities as legitimate. The exploitation of widely used technologies, which security teams may not scrutinize closely, presents a growing challenge for organizations. For defenders, this calls for a reevaluation of traditional security approaches and the implementation of robust detection mechanisms to identify such evasive techniques in real time.</p>
<p>Lateral movement capabilities observed in Operation Digital Eye, linked to custom Mimikatz modifications used in previous campaigns, indicate the potential involvement of shared vendors or digital quartermasters and the important function they serve in the Chinese APT ecosystem. These centralized entities provide continuity and adaptability to cyberespionage operations, equipping threat actors with consistently updated tools and evolving tactics as they target new victims.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Binarly’s Alex Matrosov and Fabio Pagani present PKfail, a firmware supply-chain security issue affecting major device vendors and hundreds of device models.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Modern computing heavily relies on establishing and maintaining trust, which begins with trusted foundations and extends through operating systems and applications in a chain-like manner. This ensures that end users can confidently rely on the integrity of the underlying hardware, firmware, and software.</p>
<p>One of the most prevalent mechanisms for enforcing trust in the UEFI firmware ecosystem is Secure Boot, which ensures that only digitally signed and verified software is executed during the system boot process, safeguarding against attacks on “external” firmware components and boot loaders. A key component of Secure Boot is the Platform Key (PK), the root-of-trust key used for managing the cryptographic material that validates external components and bootloaders before execution.</p>
<p>Given its critical role, one would expect all best practices for cryptographic key management to be meticulously followed, but that has not always been the case. </p>
<p>In this talk, Binarly’s Alex Matrosov and Fabio Pagani unveil PKfail, a firmware supply-chain security issue affecting major device vendors and hundreds of device models. PKfail is the result of shipping default test keys included by IBVs in their reference implementation—a problem known since 2016 but clearly forgotten by the firmware industry.</p>
<p>Given these test keys leaked during various data breaches in the past few years, an attacker can leverage PKfail to completely bypass Secure Boot on affected devices. As Alex and Fabio  demonstrate in the presentation, PKfail makes it extremely straightforward to bootkit affected devices and to launch advanced firmware-level threats, such as BlackLotus.</p>
<p>The speakers also offer a retrospective industry-wide analysis on PKfail, based on their extensive dataset of UEFI firmware images, spanning hundreds of product lines marketed over the past decade.</p>
