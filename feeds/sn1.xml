					<description><![CDATA[AkiraBot uses OpenAI to generate custom outreach messages to spam chat widgets and website contact forms at scale.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">AkiraBot is a framework used to spam website chats and contact forms <em>en masse</em> to promote a low-quality SEO service.</li>
<li aria-level="1">SentinelLABS assesses that AkiraBot has targeted more than 400,000 websites and successfully spammed at least 80,000 websites since September 2024.</li>
<li aria-level="1">The bot uses OpenAI to generate custom outreach messages based on the purpose of the website.</li>
<li aria-level="1">The framework is modular and sophisticated compared to typical spam tools, employing multiple CAPTCHA bypass mechanisms &amp; network detection evasion techniques.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Whenever a new form of digital communications becomes prevalent, actors inevitably adopt it for spam to try to profit from unsuspecting users. Email has been the perennial choice for spam delivery, but the prevalence of new communications platforms has expanded the spam attack surface considerably.</p>
<p>This report explores AkiraBot, a Python framework that targets small to medium sized business website contact forms and chat widgets. AkiraBot is designed to post AI-generated spam messages tailored to the targeted website’s content that shill the services for a dubious Search Engine Optimization (SEO) network. The use of LLM-generated content likely helps these messages bypass spam filters, as the spam content is different each time a message is generated. The framework also rotates which attacker-controlled domain is supplied in the messages, further complicating spam filtering efforts.</p>
<p>The bot creator has invested significant effort into evading CAPTCHA filters as well as avoiding network detections by relying on a proxy service generally marketed towards advertisers–though the service has had considerable interest and use by cybercriminal actors.</p>
<p>AkiraBot is not related to the ransomware group Akira; this name was chosen due to the bot’s consistent use of domains that use “Akira” as the SEO service brand.</p>
<h2>Script Execution and Website Feature Targeting</h2>
<p>SentinelLABS identified several archives containing scripts related to this framework with file timestamps dating back to September 2024. The oldest archive refers to the bot as Shopbot, likely a reference to its targeting of websites using Shopify. As the tool evolved, the targeting expanded to include websites built using GoDaddy and Wix, as well as generic website contact forms, which includes websites built using Squarespace, and likely other technologies. These technologies are primarily used by small- to medium-sized businesses for their ease in enabling website development with integrations for eCommerce, website content management, and business service offerings.</p>
<p>There are many versions of this tool with file timestamps in the archives indicating activity between September 2024 to present. Each version uses one of two hardcoded OpenAI API keys and the same proxy credentials and test sites, which links the archives despite the disparate naming conventions. We identified AkiraBot-related archives that had the following root directory names:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">bubble_working_clone</li>
<li aria-level="1">fingerprints-server</li>
<li aria-level="1">GoDaddy</li>
<li aria-level="1">NextCaptcha and FastCaptcha</li>
<li aria-level="1">NextCaptchaBot-v6</li>
<li aria-level="1">override</li>
<li aria-level="1">petar_bot</li>
<li aria-level="1">shopbotpyv2</li>
<li aria-level="1">SHOPIFY_SYSTEM_UPDATED</li>
<li aria-level="1">updatedpybot</li>
<li aria-level="1">wix</li>
<li aria-level="1">wixbot</li>
<li aria-level="1">WORKING_FOLDER</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, logs from the tool reveal that the operator ran it from the following paths, suggesting that they are most likely using Windows Server systems based on the Administrator username being the most prevalent:</p>
<pre>
 	C:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/
 	C:/Users/Administrator/Downloads/
 	C:/Users/Usuario/Desktop/ - only appears in the archive named GoDaddy
</pre>
<p>Originally, AkiraBot spammed website contact forms enticing the site owner to purchase SEO services. Newer versions of AkiraBot have also targeted the Live Chat widgets integrated into many websites, including Reamaze widgets.</p>

<p>The bot has a GUI that shows success metrics and lets the operator choose a target list to run against. The GUI lets the operator customize how many threads are running at once, a feature the bot uses to target many sites concurrently.</p>

<h3>Spam Message Generation</h3>
<p>Searching for websites referencing AkiraBot domains shows that the bot previously spammed websites in a way that the message was indexed by search engines.</p>
<figure id="attachment_117836" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-117836" style="width: 669px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_10.jpg" alt="Google search results containing useakira[.]com" width="669" height="566" class="size-full wp-image-117836" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_10.jpg 669w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_10-300x254.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-117836" class="wp-caption-text">Google search results containing <em>useakira[.]com</em></figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_117824" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-117824" style="width: 1208px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_20.jpg" alt="Spam comment on website from 2023 and content from AkiraBot templates.txt file" width="1208" height="578" class="size-full wp-image-117824" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_20.jpg 1208w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_20-300x144.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_20-1024x490.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_20-768x367.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1208px) 100vw, 1208px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-117824" class="wp-caption-text">Spam comment on website from 2023 and content from AkiraBot <em>templates.txt</em> file</figcaption></figure>
<p>AkiraBot creates custom spam messages for targeted websites by processing a template that contains a generic outline of the type of message the bot should send.</p>
<figure id="attachment_117834" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-117834" style="width: 1038px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_12.jpg" alt="Spam message template" width="1038" height="342" class="size-full wp-image-117834" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_12.jpg 1038w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_12-300x99.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_12-1024x337.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_12-768x253.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1038px) 100vw, 1038px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-117834" class="wp-caption-text">Spam message template</figcaption></figure>
<p>The template is processed by a prompt sent to the OpenAI chat API to generate a customized outreach message based on the contents of the website. The OpenAI client uses model gpt-4o-mini and is assigned the role &#8220;<i>You are a helpful assistant that generates marketing messages.</i>&#8221; and the prompt instructs the LLM to replace the variables <code>&lt;WEBSITE_NAME></code> and <code>&lt;KEYWORD></code> with the site name provided at runtime.</p>
<figure id="attachment_117832" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-117832" style="width: 1186px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_14.jpg" alt="AI Chat prompt from v10.py" width="1186" height="677" class="size-full wp-image-117832" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_14.jpg 1186w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_14-300x171.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_14-1024x585.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_14-768x438.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1186px) 100vw, 1186px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-117832" class="wp-caption-text">AI Chat prompt from <em>v10.py</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <code>&lt;KEYWORD></code> is generated by processing the <code>{context}</code> variable, which contains text scraped from the targeted website via <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/" target="_blank">BeautifulSoup</a>, a library that transforms raw HTML code into human–or LLM–readable text.</p>
<figure id="attachment_117817" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-117817" style="width: 1059px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_7.jpg" alt="AkiraBot generate_message function" width="1059" height="680" class="size-full wp-image-117817" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_7.jpg 1059w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_7-300x193.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_7-1024x658.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_7-768x493.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1059px) 100vw, 1059px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-117817" class="wp-caption-text">AkiraBot&#8217;s <em>generate_message</em> function</figcaption></figure>
<p>The resulting message includes a brief description of the targeted website, making the message seem curated. The benefit of generating each message using an LLM is that the message content is unique and filtering against spam becomes more difficult compared to using a consistent message template which can trivially be filtered.</p>
<figure id="attachment_117835" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-117835" style="width: 1059px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_11.jpg" alt="Logged AI-generated outreach messages in submissions.csv" width="1059" height="670" class="size-full wp-image-117835" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_11.jpg 1059w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_11-300x190.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_11-1024x648.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_11-768x486.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1059px) 100vw, 1059px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-117835" class="wp-caption-text">Logged AI-generated outreach messages in <em>submissions.csv</em></figcaption></figure>
<h2>CAPTCHA Bypass &amp; Network Evasion Techniques</h2>
<h3>CAPTCHA Bypass</h3>
<p>AkiraBot puts significant emphasis on evading CAPTCHAs so that it can spam websites at scale. The targeted CAPTCHA services include hCAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA, including Cloudflare’s hCAPTCHA service in certain versions of the tool.</p>
<p>We identified an archive with files for CAPTCHA-related servers and browser fingerprints, which allow the bot’s web traffic to mimic a legitimate end user. The archives contain a fingerprint server that runs on the same system as the other AkiraBot tools and intercepts the website loading processes using Selenium <a href="https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebDriver</a>, an automation framework that simulates user browsing activity.</p>
<p>The <code>inject.js</code> script injects code into the targeted website’s Document Object Model (DOM) which enables the tool to modify how the website loads in real time and change behaviors. <code>inject.js</code> manipulates values in the session via a headless Chrome instance that makes the session appear like an end user’s browser to the webserver. The script modifies multiple browser attributes that webservers use to identify the nature of the browser viewing the website, including:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Audio Context and Voice engines, which are used to profile whether a session is headless or a real browser</li>
<li aria-level="1">Graphics rendering, including canvas and WebGL attributes</li>
<li aria-level="1">Installed fonts</li>
<li aria-level="1"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Navigator</a> objects, which provide a wealth of profiling information, such as browser type, operating system &amp; architecture, geolocation, hardware details, languages installed, and browser privacy settings</li>
<li aria-level="1">System memory, storage, and CPU profile</li>
<li aria-level="1">Timezone</li>
</ul>
<p>The bot uses several CAPTCHA bypassing services, including Capsolver, FastCaptcha, and NextCaptcha, which are failover services for when browser emulation is insufficient to interact with the targeted website.</p>
<figure id="attachment_117819" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-117819" style="width: 1254px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_4.jpg" alt="FastCaptcha token generator function in v10.py" width="1254" height="630" class="size-full wp-image-117819" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_4.jpg 1254w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_4-300x151.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_4-1024x514.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_4-768x386.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1254px) 100vw, 1254px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-117819" class="wp-caption-text">FastCaptcha token generator function in <em>v10.py</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>AkiraBot also runs a headless Chrome instance to refresh values for <a href="https://support.reamaze.com/kb/automation/enable-ai-spam-filtering-for-chat-and-email-channels" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reamaze</a> tokens periodically. Reamaze provides websites with customer support chat integrations, making this another targeted feature. The service also offers spam filters for chats on its platform, indicating that this is a known vector for spam attacks.</p>
<figure id="attachment_117821" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-117821" style="width: 736px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_23.jpg" alt="Reamaze token handling function" width="736" height="419" class="size-full wp-image-117821" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_23.jpg 736w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_23-300x171.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 736px) 100vw, 736px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-117821" class="wp-caption-text">Reamaze token handling function</figcaption></figure>
<h3>Network Evasion Techniques</h3>
<p>AkiraBot uses many different proxy hosts to evade network detections and diversify the source of where its traffic comes from. In each archive SentinelLABS analyzed, AkiraBot used the SmartProxy service. SmartProxy’s website claims that its proxies are ethically sourced and that they provide data center, mobile, and residential proxies. Each version of the bot uses the same proxy credentials, suggesting the same actor is behind each iteration.</p>
<figure id="attachment_117826" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-117826" style="width: 649px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_19.jpg" alt="get_random_proxy function in The_NextCaptcha_Bot.py" width="649" height="288" class="size-full wp-image-117826" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_19.jpg 649w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_19-300x133.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 649px) 100vw, 649px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-117826" class="wp-caption-text"><em>get_random_proxy</em> function in <em>The_NextCaptcha_Bot.py</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>While SmartProxy is a service that seems to operate within legal boundaries, it is worth noting that it has regularly had the attention of cybercriminals. The BlackBasta ransomware leaks referenced an exchange of SmartProxy credentials, for example.</p>
<figure id="attachment_117828" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-117828" style="width: 1216px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_17.jpg" alt="SmartProxy credentials from BlackBasta leaks" width="1216" height="306" class="size-full wp-image-117828" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_17.jpg 1216w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_17-300x75.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_17-1024x258.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_17-768x193.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1216px) 100vw, 1216px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-117828" class="wp-caption-text">SmartProxy credentials from BlackBasta leaks</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Logging &amp; Success</h2>
<p>AkiraBot logs its spam progress to <code>submissions.csv</code>, which sometimes includes the AI-generated spam message contents as well. The <code>submissions.csv</code> file from the January 2025 archives show more than 80,000 unique domains that were successfully spammed. The script also logs failed attempts in <code>failed.txt</code> and <code>failed_old.txt</code>. The January 2025 archives showed that only 11,000 domains had failed, including previous runs of the tool. We analyzed all <code>submissions.csv</code> files; deduplicating the results revealed that more than 420,000 unique domains were targeted in total.</p>
<p>Two versions of AkiraBot used a Telegram bot for logging success metrics. The scripts <code>monitor.py</code> and <code>monitor_random.py</code> would collect success metrics from the bot and post them to a Telegram channel via API.</p>
<figure id="attachment_117823" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-117823" style="width: 853px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_21.jpg" alt="Telegram sending functionality in monitor.py" width="853" height="403" class="size-full wp-image-117823" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_21.jpg 853w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_21-300x142.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_21-768x363.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 853px) 100vw, 853px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-117823" class="wp-caption-text">Telegram sending functionality in <em>monitor.py</em></figcaption></figure>
<h2>Telegram Detail</h2>
<p>The Telegram functionality, contained in the <code>monitor.py</code> and <code>monitor_random.py</code> scripts, is tied into proxy rotation and CAPTCHA defeat features contained within the bundled JavaScript file <code>script.js</code>.  The <code>monitor.py</code> script utilizes <code>pyautogui</code> to paste the contents of <code>script.js</code> into a browser developer console by scripting CTRL+SHIFT+J, followed by the paste command, eventually executing the JavaScript within the browser console.</p>
<figure id="attachment_117837" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-117837" style="width: 337px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_1.jpg" alt="pyautogui actions in monitor.py" width="337" height="369" class="size-full wp-image-117837" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_1.jpg 337w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_1-274x300.jpg 274w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 337px) 100vw, 337px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-117837" class="wp-caption-text"><em>pyautogui</em> actions in <em>monitor.py</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The pasted and executed JavaScript is then responsible for attempting CAPTCHA refreshes and defeats on targeted URLs, reporting the status returned to a JSON file, <code>stats.json</code>. If a proxy rotation is required, to aid further in refreshing the CAPTCHA defeat attempts on a given URL, the <code>monitor.py</code> script handles this as well, rotating the used proxy though the iproxyonline service (<code>fxdx[.]in</code>).</p>
<p>Proxy rotation is generally enabled to avoid geographic or IP-based restrictions when repeatedly attempting to refresh and defeat CAPTCHAs. The Telegram status updates specifically report on proxy rotations and CAPTCHA submissions. Some versions of these scripts have the proxy rotation section commented out, indicating that it is an optional feature.</p>

<h2>Infrastructure</h2>
<p>The spam messages frequently rotate the domain used, likely in an attempt to avoid detection. The oldest domain in use is <code>akirateam[.]com</code>, which was registered in January 2022 on a Germany-based IP, <code>91.195.240[.]94</code>, without further updates until March 2023. The second oldest domain is <code>goservicewrap[.]com</code>, which was registered in April 2024 and resolved to <code>86.38.202[.]110</code>, a Hostinger IP in Cyprus.</p>
<p>Several AkiraBot domains have interesting connections through historical DNS activity. The subdomain <code>mail.servicewrap-go[.]com</code> briefly shared a CNAME record pointing to <code>77980.bodis[.]com</code>, which is associated with various malicious activities, including a 2023 malvertising <a href="https://blog.sucuri.net/2023/07/malicious-injection-redirects-traffic-to-parked-domain.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">campaign</a>. This domain also received communications from several Windows executable files that were detected as various banking trojans.</p>
<p>An odd relationship stood out in anchor links referencing <code>77980.bodis[.]com</code>: the website <code>unj[.]digital</code> contained anchor links from December 2024 through February 2025 pointing to <code>77980.bodis[.]com</code>. UNJ Digital&#8217;s website describes itself as a digital marketing and software development firm. The subdomain <code>smtp.unj[.]digital</code> also has a CNAME record pointing to <code>77980.bodis[.]com</code>, fortifying a connection between these hosts. While the website now highlights offering digital content services, as of late 2024 the site showed a focus on increasing marketing revenue.</p>

<h2>Akira and ServiceWrap SEO</h2>
<p>AkiraBot uses two distinct themes in their SEO offering domain naming conventions: <a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/useakira.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Akira</a> and <a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/servicewrapgo.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ServiceWrap</a>. Reviews for both services on TrustPilot are similar: many 5-star reviews with similar, potentially AI-generated contents, and the occasional 1-star review complaining that the site is either a scam or has spammed the person leaving the review.</p>
<p>The 5-star reviews tend to follow a pattern where the reviewer has one previous review that was made 1-5 days before the Akira or ServiceWrap review. The review themes are very similar across these 5-star reviews, though the contents and structure are always unique. We believe the actor may be generating some fake reviews, though it is difficult to say with certainty.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>AkiraBot is a sprawling framework that has undergone multiple iterations to integrate new spamming target technologies and evade website defenses. We expect this campaign to continue to evolve as website hosting providers adapt defenses to deter spam. The author or authors have invested significant effort in this bot’s ability to bypass commonly used CAPTCHA technologies, which demonstrates that the operators are motivated to violate service provider protections.</p>
<p>AkiraBot’s use of LLM-generated spam message content demonstrates the emerging challenges that AI poses to defending websites against spam attacks. The easiest indicators to block are the rotating set of domains used to sell the Akira and ServiceWrap SEO offerings, as there is no longer a consistent approach in the spam message contents as there were with previous campaigns selling the services of these firms.</p>
<p>SentinelLABS thanks the OpenAI security team for their collaboration and continued efforts in deterring bad actors from abusing their services. The OpenAI team shared the following response following their investigation:</p>
<p><em>“We&#8217;re grateful to SentinelOne for sharing their research. Distributing output from our services for spam is against our policies. The API key involved is disabled, and we’re continuing to investigate and will disable any associated assets. We take misuse seriously and are continually improving our systems to detect abuse.”</em></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Dakota Cary and Eugenio Benincasa explore China's CTF ecosystem, highlighting competitions held by the Ministry of State Security and the PLA.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>APT40 used CTFs at Hainan University to recruit hackers and source software vulnerabilities for operations. Jiangsu MSS received vulnerabilities from the Tianfu Cup. iSoon hosted their own CTF before their files were leaked on Github. Chinese intelligence cutouts tried to pitch US participants at RealWorldCTF. The list goes on.</p>
<p>A diverse ecosystem of CTFs exists in China and it has, until now, been largely ignored. Since 2017 when the PRC government issued rules to bolster cybersecurity competitions, incorporate them into talent cultivation and training programs, and limit the amount of money to be paid out in rewards, China’s security ecosystem has launched more than 150 unique competitions. Including competitions that are held annually, the number of events since 2017 exceeds 400.</p>
<p>Not all these competitions are software vulnerability competitions like Tianfu Cup—in fact, few are. Most are aimed at talent cultivation and recruiting, and many are hosted by the military, the intelligence services, or other arms of the state.</p>
<p>This talk explores the diversity of China’s CTF ecosystem, its major leagues and events, and the annual number of participants across society. It highlights competitions held expressly by the Ministry of State Security and the PLA—delving into the competitions’ particulars. Defenders with appropriate CTI collection capabilities will better understand how to target their collection efforts on specific individuals in China.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kryptina RaaS is a Linux-focused RaaS platform &amp; service that started life as an unsellable giveaway. However, large-scale ransomware operations are now adopting the platform to extend their reach into Linux and cloud environments.</p>
<p>In this talk, Jim Walter reveals how a recent leak from a Mallox ransomware-affiliated actor’s staging server provided insight into how Kryptina has been adapted for use in enterprise attacks.</p>
<p>The presentation focuses on recent developments and provides an understanding of why threat actors are attracted to the Kryptina platform, and what this means in the context of victims and targeting.</p>
<p>Jim also dissects what was included in the May 2024 Mallox leak and improvements and modifications that threat actors have made to the Kryptina platform.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Kim Zetter interviews David Weston on topics such as the fallout from the CrowdStrike outage, Windows Recall and improving Microsoft security. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this exclusive interview at LABScon 2024, award-winning investigative journalist Kim Zetter and Microsoft Corporate VP Enterprise and OS Security David Weston discuss Microsoft kernel security, the CrowdStrike outage, AI, and how Microsoft plans to improve the resilience and security of the Windows ecosystem.</p>
<p>As the world&#8217;s data has increasingly become associated with Microsoft infrastructure and exposed to Microsoft products, threat actors have focused their efforts on exploiting security weaknesses in the vendor&#8217;s operating system. Weston and Zetter explore how this has led Microsoft to raise the priority of security at the engineering level, even at the expense of curtailing operating system features.</p>
<p>In addition, the conversation ranges over how the CrowdStrike outage of 2024 led Microsoft to a new focus on resilience and to the development of a user mode API to restrict access to the kernel to third party products. Weston also discusses the need for security vendors to implement secure deployment practices to better protect customers from rogue updates and tackles questions around the use of AI and the controversial Windows Recall feature.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Kristin Del Rosso &#038; Madeleine Devost explore the growing trend of foreign ownership of farmland and its implications for national security.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Who really owns America’s farmland, and why does it matter? In this deep dive into the secretive world of foreign investment in U.S. agricultural land, Kristin Del Rosso and Madeleine Devost explore the growing trend of foreign ownership, which has surged by 50% since 2017, and its profound implications for national security. Using the USDA’s data, the presenters shed light on how these investments could potentially impact everything from local economies to national defense.</p>
<p>The talk dives into the complexities of the USDA’s data collection methods, revealing how manual processes and outdated systems obscure the true extent of foreign ownership. It also discusses the critical role of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) in safeguarding national interests, and the urgent need for improved data sharing and automation between CFIUS and the USDA.</p>
<p>Through real-life examples, including controversial land purchases near sensitive military sites, Kristin and Madeleine illustrate the potential risks and propose actionable recommendations to enhance transparency and security.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Latest Ghostwriter campaign brings Belarusian opposition into its sights for the first time as it continues weaponizing XLS docs to drop malware.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">SentinelLABS has observed a campaign targeting opposition activists in Belarus as well as Ukrainian military and government organizations.</li>
<li aria-level="1">The campaign has been in preparation since July-August 2024 and entered the active phase in November-December 2024.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Recent malware samples and command-and-control (C2) infrastructure activity indicate that the operation remains active in recent days.</li>
<li aria-level="1">SentinelLABS assesses that this cluster of threat activity is an extension of the long-running Ghostwriter campaign identified in previous public reporting.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ghostwriter | Background</h2>
<p>Ghostwriter is a long-running campaign likely active since 2016 and subsequently described in various public reports throughout 2020 to 2024. The actor behind Ghostwriter campaigns is closely linked with Belarusian government espionage efforts, while most commonly reported under the APT names <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/unc1151-linked-to-belarus-government/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UNC1151</a> (Mandiant) or <a href="https://cert.gov.ua/search/UAC-0057" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UAC-0057</a> (CERT-UA). Some public reports may use the term &#8220;Ghostwriter APT&#8221; interchangeably to refer to both the threat actor and its associated campaigns.</p>
<p>Previous <a href="https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/2699483/Ghostwriter-Report-Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">research</a> on the evolution of Ghostwriter noted how it operated successfully across a range of platforms, blending information manipulation with hacking to target a number of European countries. Reporting throughout 2022 to 2024 described <a href="https://cert.gov.ua/article/6280159" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">activity</a> in which malicious Excel documents were used to deliver PicassoLoader and Cobalt Strike payloads. Observed document lures were themed around issues pertaining to the Ukraine military and the <a href="https://cyble.com/blog/unc1151-strikes-again-unveiling-their-tactics-against-ukraines-ministry-of-defence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">likely targeting</a> of the Ministry of Defense.</p>
<p>SentinelLABS has observed new activity with multiple weaponized Excel documents containing lures pertaining to the interests of the Ukraine government, the Ukraine military and domestic Belarusian opposition. While some of the TTPs we have observed overlap with previous reporting, others are new, including adaptations of previously observed payloads such as PicassoLoader.</p>
<h2>Weaponized XLS 1 | &#8220;Political Prisoners in Minsk Courts&#8221;</h2>
<p>SentinelLABS analyzed an attack that started with a Google Drive shared document landing in the target’s inbox. The email originated from an account using the name “Vladimir Nikiforech” (<code>vladimir.nikiforeach@gmail[.]com</code>). The email link pointed to a downloadable RAR archive, which according to the internal timestamps was created on 2025-01-14 00:47:54, containing a malicious Excel workbook (<code>ebb30fd99c2e6cbae392c337df5876759e53730d</code>) with the file name <code>политзаключенные(по судам минска).xls</code> (“Political prisoners (across courts of Minsk).xls”).</p>
<p>The title of the lure indicates an interesting shift in Ghostwriter targeting. Although attribution for the 2021 Ghostwriter campaign <a href="https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/2699483/Ghostwriter-Report-Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pointed to</a> the Belarus state, this is the first time we have seen lures directly aimed at Belarus government opposition. The timing of the attack could have been motivated by the presidential election that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Belarusian_presidential_election" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took place</a> shortly after on Jan 26, 2025.</p>
<p>The XLS document contains an obfuscated VBA macro which is activated when the document is opened and the user allows Office macros to run.</p>
<figure id="attachment_114850" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-114850" style="width: 1837px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_3.jpg" alt="Obfuscated macro inside the XLS spreadsheet" width="1837" height="752" class="size-full wp-image-114850" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_3.jpg 1837w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_3-300x123.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_3-1024x419.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_3-768x314.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_3-1536x629.jpg 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1837px) 100vw, 1837px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-114850" class="wp-caption-text">Obfuscated macro inside the XLS spreadsheet</figcaption></figure>
<p>On execution, the macro writes a file to <code>%Temp%\Realtek(r)Audio.dll</code>.</p>
<p>The DLL file is loaded with the following command line invocation:</p>
<pre>
C:\Windows\System32\regsvr32.exe /u /s "C:\Temp\Realtek(r)Audio.dll”
</pre>
<p>This starts the standard Windows process <code>regsvr32.exe</code>, which calls the <code>DllUnregisterServer</code> function implemented inside the DLL; the function then loads and executes the .NET assembly described next.</p>
<p>Analysis of <code>Dwnldr.dll</code> shows that it is a DLL file with a .NET assembly embedded inside. The file is protected with <a href="https://mkaring.github.io/ConfuserEx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ConfuserEx</a> &#8211; a publicly available tool that helps to obfuscate .NET programs and observed in previous Ghostwriter campaigns.</p>
<p>The DLL file hosts a payload that appears to be a simplified variant of PicassoDownloader, a malware family also linked to Ghostwriter activity. The internal filename (<code>Dwnldr.dll</code>) was previously used by the Ghostwriter threat actor; however, this variant bears only high-level similarities to previous versions, with significant changes to the underlying code, possibly to make it a cheaper and more expendable tool.</p>
<p>As a part of application protection provided by the obfuscator, the Downloader creates a copy of itself in memory, and then modifies it. It does so by decrypting additional code of the assembly. It also uses a clever evasion technique, altering its own PE header in memory and breaking internal links to the .NET assembly. This makes it impossible for security products to parse it as a .NET module.</p>
<p>During code execution, after the protection layer passes control to core functionality, the Downloader writes a decoy Excel workbook file to <code>%AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\temp.xlsx</code> and downloads additional file(s) from the Web.</p>
<p>The <code>temp.xlsx</code> decoy file (<code>18151b3801bd716b5a33cfc85dbdc4ba84a00314</code>) is immediately opened in Excel in an attempt to make the victim believe that it contains the original content of the <code>политзаключенные (по судам минска).xls</code> file.</p>
<figure id="attachment_114854" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-114854" style="width: 1999px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_11.jpg" alt="Decoy document containing lists of people with criminal charges, prosecutors’ and judges’ names" width="1999" height="803" class="size-full wp-image-114854" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_11.jpg 1999w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_11-300x121.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_11-1024x411.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_11-768x309.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_11-1536x617.jpg 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-114854" class="wp-caption-text">Decoy document containing lists of people with criminal charges, prosecutors’ and judges’ names</figcaption></figure>
<p>The spreadsheet contains the names of people with criminal charges along with the names of prosecutors and judges: content that invites the reader to believe it could be leaked from a government source. However, the information was already in the public domain and can be found on the website of a proscribed Belarusian human rights organization, <a href="https://prisoners.spring96.org/ru/list" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spring96</a>.</p>
<p>Once the decoy Excel file is opened, the Downloader attempts to fetch the next stage from the following URL:</p>
<pre>
https://everythingandthedog[.]shop/petsblog/2020/2/25/tips-for-taking-difficult-dogs-on-a-walk.jpg
</pre>
<figure id="attachment_114852" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-114852" style="width: 720px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_13.jpg" alt="The JPG image file fetched from the C2" width="720" height="960" class="size-full wp-image-114852" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_13.jpg 720w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_13-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-114852" class="wp-caption-text">The JPG image file fetched from the C2</figcaption></figure>
<p>We note that the <code>.shop</code> top level domain was also reported in other Ghostwriter activity seen in 2024.</p>
<p>When the malware issues the HTTP request, it uses a hardcoded User-Agent string:</p>
<pre>
Mozilla/5.0 (<b>Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7</b>) AppleWebKit/555.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/97.0.4692.71 Safari/537.36
</pre>
<p>The fetched file (<code>8d2bb96e69df059f279d97989690ce3e556a8318</code>) is a benign JPEG file, originating from publicly available photo stock, with no extra payload or any hidden cave where code could be embedded. We confirmed that an identical file can be found online, located on a web site that is nearly identical to the one used by attackers. It would seem the attackers not only reused the JPG file contents from a legitimate website but also copied its original URL, changing only the top level domain:</p>
<pre>
https://www.everythingandthedog<b>.com</b>/petsblog/2020/2/25/tips-for-taking-difficult-dogs-on-a-walk.
</pre>
<p>Once the file is downloaded, it is renamed and then saved to <code>%APPDATA%\Roaming\Microsoft\SystemCertificates\CertificateCenter.dll</code>.</p>
<p>Later, it is registered to load during autostart by leveraging the Registry Run key:</p>
<pre>
HKCU\System\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\Microsoft Certificate Center
</pre>
<p>with its value pointing to expanded environment variable string:</p>
<pre>
rundll32.exe C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\SystemCertificates\CertificateCenter.dll,#1
</pre>
<p>This Registry entry makes <code>rundll32.exe</code> load the DLL and execute its exported function with ordinal 1 whenever a user logs on.</p>
<figure id="attachment_114847" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-114847" style="width: 1999px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_6.jpg" alt="Overview of the malware stages for Weaponized XLS 1" width="1999" height="1180" class="size-full wp-image-114847" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_6.jpg 1999w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_6-300x177.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_6-1024x604.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_6-768x453.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_6-1536x907.jpg 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-114847" class="wp-caption-text">Overview of the malware stages for Weaponized XLS 1</figcaption></figure>
<p>During our analysis we only observed the benign JPG file being downloaded. However, based on the code analysis, we believe that the real targets receive an actual DLL. We assume that such a targeted payload delivery process is carefully controlled by the attackers and that they deliver the payload only after confirming the requesting client&#8217;s profile (browser user agent, IP address of the client, and matching time of the operation window). <a href="https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/menace-unleashed-excel-file-deploys-cobalt-strike-at-ukraine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Research</a> in a previous campaign found that a Cobalt Strike payload was delivered to targets only if the host IP was located in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Given the timing and targeting of the attack, we hypothesized that it may not have been an isolated incident. Further research led us to discover other samples closely resembling Weaponized XLS 1, suggesting that multiple attacks using the same techniques had been planned or executed. The samples used in these suspected attacks are described below.</p>
<h2>Weaponized XLS 2 | Ukraine Gov “Anti-Corruption Initiative”</h2>
<p>A file bearing the Ukrainian name <code>Zrazok.xls</code> (“Sample.xls”) is an XLS file (<code>301ffdf0c7b67e01fd2119c321e7ae09b7835afc</code>) with an obfuscated VBA macro embedded. However, the script code and obfuscation technique are different from the case we discussed earlier.</p>
<p>For this script, the attackers used a popular obfuscator tool called <a href="https://github.com/sevagas/macro_pack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Macropack</a>, an open-source but seemingly abandoned project originally developed for red-teaming and penetration testing exercises.</p>
<figure id="attachment_114845" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-114845" style="width: 1837px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_8.jpg" alt="Macropack-obfuscated VBA macro found inside the spreadsheet" width="1837" height="752" class="size-full wp-image-114845" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_8.jpg 1837w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_8-300x123.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_8-1024x419.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_8-768x314.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_8-1536x629.jpg 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1837px) 100vw, 1837px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-114845" class="wp-caption-text">Macropack-obfuscated VBA macro found inside the spreadsheet</figcaption></figure>
<p>As in the previous case, once the macro code is executed, the .NET ConfuserEx-obfuscated Downloader DLL (written to <code>%AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\bruhdll32.dll</code>) is loaded with <code>rundll32.exe</code> and respective commandline arguments to run an exported function. After this, the new module drops a decoy XLS file and opens it with Excel.</p>
<figure id="attachment_114851" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-114851" style="width: 1790px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_2.jpg" alt="The decoy document prepared for a Ukrainian reader (an action plan for anti-corruption initiative in government organisations in Ukraine)" width="1790" height="1255" class="size-full wp-image-114851" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_2.jpg 1790w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_2-300x210.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_2-1024x718.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_2-768x538.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_2-1536x1077.jpg 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1790px) 100vw, 1790px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-114851" class="wp-caption-text">The decoy document prepared for a Ukrainian reader (an action plan for anti-corruption initiative in government organisations in Ukraine)</figcaption></figure>
<p>This module attempts to download the next stage from the following URL (unavailable at the time of writing):</p>
<pre>
https://sciencealert[.]shop/images/2024/11/black-hole-coronaxx.jpg
</pre>
<p>When the malware issues the HTTP request it uses a hardcoded User-Agent string that differs slightly from the previous case:</p>
<pre>
Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/97.0.4692.71 Safari/537.36
</pre>
<p>Notably, this file (<code>52e894acf0e14d27f8997d2174c1f40d6d87bba9</code>) was previously uploaded to <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/4497bb70ca95b115d7be403141e34f7fb06070b8dd6ccf034d9a71c1c48826e4/details" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VirusTotal</a> on December 19, 2024.</p>
<figure id="attachment_114846" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-114846" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_7.jpg" alt="Image file fetched from the malicious URL" width="1024" height="415" class="size-full wp-image-114846" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_7.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_7-300x122.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_7-768x311.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-114846" class="wp-caption-text">Image file fetched from the malicious URL</figcaption></figure>
<p>As with the previous case, the image file and its URL path appear to be copied from a public blog, published on Nov 16, 2024:</p>
<pre>
https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-reveal-the-shape-of-a-black-holes-corona-for-the-very-first-time
</pre>
<p>Again, the file name and the path on the malicious server were nearly identical to the legitimate one, with the actor changing only the top level domain from <code>.com</code> to <code>.shop</code>.</p>
<pre>
https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/black-hole-coronaxx.jpg
</pre>
<p>In this case, the downloaded file is expected to be an archive in a GZIP format. Once downloaded, the malware decompresses it and saves it to the following location:</p>
<pre>
%APPDATA%\Roaming\Microsoft\SystemCertificates\CertificateCenter.dll
</pre>
<p>It also creates an additional text config file at:</p>
<pre>
%APPDATA%\Roaming\Microsoft\SystemCertificates\config
</pre>
<p>The config file contains the following data:</p>
<pre>
&lt;Project xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003"&gt;
 &lt;PropertyGroup&gt;
  &lt;AssemblyName&gt;Certificate&lt;/AssemblyName&gt;
  &lt;OutputPath&gt;Bin\&lt;/OutputPath&gt;
 &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;
 &lt;ItemGroup&gt;
  &lt;Compile Include="CertificateCenter.dll" /&gt;
 &lt;/ItemGroup&gt;
 &lt;Target Name="Build"&gt;
  &lt;MakeDir Directories="$(OutputPath)" Condition="!Exists('$(OutputPath)')" /&gt;
  &lt;Csc Sources="@(Compile)" OutputAssembly="$(OutputPath)$(AssemblyName).exe" /&gt;
 &lt;/Target&gt;
&lt;/Project&gt;
</pre>
<p>The config file is used by the Downloader to execute <code>MSBuild.exe</code>, instructing it to build a new application:</p>
<pre>
C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\MSBuild.exe %AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\SystemCertificates\config
</pre>
<p>This suggests that the <code>CertificateCenter.dll</code> file is not a binary as the file extension would suggest but rather contains program source code. The command, if successful, produces an executable file in the following location:</p>
<pre>
%AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\SystemCertificates\Bin\Certificate.exe

<h2>Weaponized XLS 3 | &#8220;Supplies for Ukraine Armed Forces&#8221;</h2>
<p>A file bearing the Ukrainian name <code>Донесення 5 реч - зразок.xls</code> (“Report 5 items &#8211; sample.xls”) is an XLS file (<code>9d110879d101bcaec7accc3001295a53dc33371f</code>) hosting another VBA payload obfuscated with Macropack.</p>
<p>As in the previous cases, once the macro code is executed, the .NET ConfuserEx-obfuscated Downloader DLL (written to <code>%AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\bruhdll32.dll</code>) is loaded with <code>rundll32.exe</code> and respective commandline arguments to run an exported function. After this, the new module drops a decoy XLS file on disk and opens it with Excel.</p>
<figure id="attachment_114849" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-114849" style="width: 1989px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_4.jpg" alt="The decoy document prepared for a Ukrainian reader (a report template for the Ukrainian armed forces supplies)" width="1989" height="1256" class="size-full wp-image-114849" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_4.jpg 1989w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_4-300x189.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_4-1024x647.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_4-768x485.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_4-1536x970.jpg 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1989px) 100vw, 1989px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-114849" class="wp-caption-text">The decoy document prepared for a Ukrainian reader (a report template for the Ukrainian armed forces supplies)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Again, the malware uses the same payload retrieval technique and downloads a JPG file from yet another <code>.shop</code> domain:</p>
<pre>
https://cookingwithbooks[.]shop/images/qwerty.jpg
</pre>
<p>The URL is unavailable at the time of writing, but data from VirusTotal indicates that the downloaded file is identical to the black hole image described above in the Weaponized XLS 2 section. The malware logic is also identical with Weaponized XLS 2.</p>
<h2>Weaponized XLS 4 &amp; 5 | Variations on a Theme</h2>
<p>In addition to the previous findings, we discovered further related XLS files that were similarly weaponized. The files <code>Донесення 5 реч фонд зборів- зразок.xls</code> (“Report 5 items collection fund- sample.xls”; <code>2c06c01f9261fe80b627695a0ed746aa8f1f3744</code>) and <code>Додаток 8 реч новий.xls</code> (“Addition 8 items new &#8211; sample.xls”; <code>853da593d2a489c2bd72a284a362d7c68c3a4d4c</code>) were first uploaded from Ukraine in Feb 2025.</p>
<p>Both files contain a Macropack-obfuscated VBA macro; however, they differ in structure. Functionally, both drop a DLL to the previously noted path <code>%AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\bruhdll32.dll</code>.</p>
<p>Again, the DLL is loaded with <code>rundll32.exe</code> and respective command line arguments to execute an exported function. Next, the victim sees a decoy workbook open in Excel.</p>

<p>The decoys are similar and the obfuscation technique, code structure, and the embedded URL are common to both:</p>
<pre>
https://pigglywigglystores[.]shop/wp-content/themes/fp-wp-j-piggly-wiggly-nc/resources/images/logo/logo.png
</pre>
<p>The User-Agent string in the HTTP request, however, is different, with the operating system and architectures specified as “Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64”.</p>
<pre>
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/97.0.4692.71 Safari/537.36 Edg/97.0.1072.71
</pre>
<p>These variants of the malware also contain another embedded .NET DLL, internally referred to as LibCMD from the original filename <code>LibCMD.dll</code> (<code>4ae6b8adc980ba8a212b838f3ca6a9718d9a3757</code>). This is a small file, whose purpose is simply to start <code>cmd.exe</code> and connect to stdin/stdout.</p>
<p>The file contains a tampered PE link timestamp. It is never saved to disk; instead, it is loaded dynamically in memory as a .NET assembly and executed.</p>

<h2>Attribution</h2>
<p>Analysis of techniques used by threat actors can often be helpful in establishing the origin of the attack and the malware it uses. In this case, the obfuscation techniques are quite specific across all the samples we analyzed, allowing us to establish a medium confidence link between them and a malware cluster known as PicassoLoader, a downloader toolkit.</p>
<p>PicassoLoader has been used in cyber attacks targeting government, military, and civilian entities in Ukraine and Poland and is exclusively associated with the Ghostwriter threat actor (<i>aka</i> UNC1151, UAC-0057, Blue Dev 4, Moonscape, TA445).</p>
<p>Throughout 2024, Ghostwriter has repeatedly used a combination of Excel workbooks containing Macropack-obfuscated VBA macros and dropped embedded .NET downloaders obfuscated with ConfuserEx. In our case, the Downloader malware appears to be a simplified implementation of the PicassoLoader.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Ghostwriter threat actor has been consistently active in the past years and continues its attempts to compromise targets aligned with the interests of Belarus and its closest ally, Russia. It has mounted multiple attacks reported by CERT UA and other security researchers throughout 2024.</p>
<p>While Belarus doesn’t actively participate in military campaigns in the war in Ukraine, cyber threat actors associated with it appear to have no reservation about conducting cyberespionage operations against Ukrainian targets.</p>
<p>The campaign described in this publication also serves as confirmation that Ghostwriter is closely tied with the interests of the Belarusian government waging an aggressive pursuit of its opposition and organizations associated with it.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Data leak reveals how a top tier cybersecurity vendor helps the PRC enforce content monitoring and manipulation of public opinion in China.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">SentinelLABS has analyzed a data leak containing infrastructure details and work logs from employees of a state-affiliated private sector security firm in China.</li>
<li aria-level="1">The leaked data contains references to web content monitoring services used to enforce censorship for public and private sector customers.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Work logs reveal that the firm provided bespoke monitoring services to a state-owned enterprise when a corruption scandal impacted this organization, providing insights into how the state and CCP coordinate with some cybersecurity companies to manage fallout from corruption scandals.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>SentinelLABS has analyzed a data leak from TopSec (北京天融), a Chinese cybersecurity firm offering services such as Endpoint Detection &amp; Response (EDR) and vulnerability scanning, while offering boutique solutions to align with government initiatives and intelligence requirements.</p>
<p>The data leak includes a document with 7,000+ lines of work logs and code used to orchestrate infrastructure for the firm’s DevOps practices and downstream customers and includes scripts that connect to several Chinese government hostnames, academic institutions and news sites.</p>
<p>We identified work logs and system features that indicate TopSec is likely enabling content moderation for internet censorship purposes, a key <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/community-watch-chinas-vision-for-the-future-of-the-internet/">strategy</a> used by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to monitor and control public opinion on issues that the state deems contentious or antisocial.</p>
<p>Further, we found evidence indicating that TopSec provided bespoke services to a state-owned enterprise on the date that a corruption investigation was announced targeting the organization’s top official.</p>
<p>The Chinese cybersecurity market has long been a mystery for many researchers in the west. Unlike Europe and parts of the Middle East, which foster some degree of collaboration, the Chinese cybersecurity market is obscured behind the wall that divides China from the global internet. This finding reveals not only the types of technologies that are used by a prestigious Chinese tech firm, but how they are providing security services to private and public sector customers inside China.</p>
<h2>TopSec</h2>
<p>TopSec is a provider of monitoring and IT security solutions, as well as big data and cloud services. Established in 1995, TopSec prides itself on its long history and prioritizes national cyberspace security as a core element of its mission statement.</p>
<p>Company registration details reveal that TopSec holds over 1,000 patents, 87 software copyrights, and has 12 subsidiaries. The company is also a <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/sleight-of-hand-how-china-weaponizes-software-vulnerability/">Tier 1 vulnerability supplier</a> to China’s civilian intelligence ministry. According to TopSec&#8217;s 2024 annual corporate report for shareholders, the company has been offering cloud monitoring services–including IT security monitoring capabilities–since 2004. By 2020, these TopSec services were in use across all 31 of China’s administrative regions.</p>

<p>The leaked documents we analyzed reference multiple organizations in both the private and public sectors, likely customers or otherwise associated with TopSec, a selection of which is listed below. These references include probable deployment sites of monitoring probes and mentions in-work progress records.</p>
<p>Public sector organizations referenced in the documents include entities integral to China’s political system, such as the Municipal Commissions for Discipline Inspection, which enforce party regulations and investigate corruption. Another example is the Illegal and Harmful Information Reporting Center, an entity dedicated to combating what the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) considers illegal and harmful behavior in the online space. TopSec customers referenced in these documents include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dongwu Fund Management Co., Ltd</li>
<li>Gucheng County Petition Bureau</li>
<li>Illegal and Harmful Information Reporting Center</li>
<li>Linhai Rural Commercial Bank</li>
<li>Petkit</li>
<li>Shanghai Diepai Automobile Technology Co</li>
<li>Shanghai Fengyilong Electronic</li>
<li>Shanghai Medical Packaging Materials Factory</li>
<li>Shanghai Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection</li>
<li>Shanghai Municipal Supervisory Commission</li>
<li>Tibet Autonomous Region</li>
<li>Tibet Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China</li>
<li>Wuhu Discipline Inspection and Supervision Network</li>
</ul>
<p>We observed references to three projects associated with Bureaus of the Ministry of Public Security in the northeastern city of Dandong, as well as the Songjiang and Pudong districts of Shanghai, with the latter project referred to as the &#8220;Cloud Monitoring Service Project&#8221;. The Ministry of Public Security is responsible for maintaining public order and overseeing law enforcement and surveillance activities to ensure compliance with national regulations.</p>
<pre>
[2024-2025 Shanghai Public Security Bureau Pudong Branch Cloud Monitoring Service Project (Phase II)]
The statistics of events that occurred today are as follows:
Aggregated events: 883 Valid: 129 Invalid: 672 On-hand: 82
Single events: 5637 Valid: 187 Invalid: 2781 On-hand: 2669
In terms of event volume, it is basically the same as that of our competitors.
</pre>
<p>A public procurement announcement for the &#8220;Cloud Monitoring Service Project&#8221; suggests that it involves monitoring the security posture and content of websites under the Bureaus&#8217; jurisdiction, with alerts issued in case of security breaches or policy violations. TopSec was likely involved in the bidding process alongside competitor companies. Public documents, however, show TopSec did not win the contract.</p>

<h2>Infrastructure Features</h2>
<p>We identified this leak as a submission to a multi-scanner platform that fired off a rule that looks for common abuse activities associated with Kubernetes. The main file we analyzed (SHA-1: <code>1bccef07ad0348e326248fe321259e2bd8f8cf8b</code>) contains numerous work logs, which are a description of the work performed by a TopSec employee and the amount of time the task took, often accompanied by scripts, commands, or data related to the task.</p>
<figure id="attachment_114590" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-114590" style="width: 755px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_5.jpg" alt="Example of work logs from the file along with English translation" width="755" height="154" class="size-full wp-image-114590" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_5.jpg 755w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_5-300x61.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 755px) 100vw, 755px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-114590" class="wp-caption-text">Example of work logs from the file along with English translation</figcaption></figure>
<p>In addition to work logs, the leak contains many commands and playbooks used to administrate TopSec’s services via multiple common DevOps and infrastructure technologies that are used worldwide, including Ansible, Docker, ElasticSearch, Gitlab, Kafka, Kibana, Kubernetes, and Redis. There are many artifacts showing JSON data for web APIs used by TopSec services. There are also network configurations, SSH and port mapping commands with hardcoded credentials, which present a huge security risk should anyone obtain access to the environment–and would likely provide access to TopSec’s downstream customers as well.</p>
<figure id="attachment_114598" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-114598" style="width: 686px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_14.jpg" alt="Ansible commands from leaked file used to access infrastructure" width="686" height="190" class="size-full wp-image-114598" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_14.jpg 686w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_14-300x83.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-114598" class="wp-caption-text">Ansible commands from leaked file used to access infrastructure</figcaption></figure>
<p>The leaked file is very large, disorganized, and the formatting is inconsistent, which complicates analysis. It is highly likely that we have not identified all capabilities outlined in the leak. Our analysis approach focused on translating the Chinese language content, identifying known technologies, and identifying interesting references in the commands and API JSON artifacts, particularly those where there were upticks in work logs performed around specific dates documented in the work logs or web API data.</p>
<p>The data leak includes a file that starts with infrastructure management code, including some which initializes several Docker images to enable security monitoring related features. These containers run probes, which are likely used for network monitoring. We are unable to fully assess the capabilities of these containers without access to them. However, the containers are run with several flags such as <code>--privileged</code> and <code>--net host</code> that suggest deep access to the monitored data. This may indicate the probes inspect network traffic or perform privileged tasks in the deployment environment.</p>
<p>Deeper in the file, there are work logs which contain dates indicating when certain tasks were performed and notes from the TopSec staff who worked on specific infrastructure projects. One project referenced repeatedly is called Sparta or Sparda, with the spelling changing regularly. Notes from the TopSec staff indicate that Sparta handles sensitive word processing, an indication of censorship keyword monitoring.</p>
<p>On a technical level, Sparta is a framework that uses GraphQL APIs to receive content from downstream web applications. Work logs indicate that TopSec migrated from a system called Apollo, which is plausibly a reference to <a href="https://github.com/apollographql">Apollo-GraphQL</a>, an open-source framework offered by a company based in San Francisco. The work logs also indicate that Sparta is equipped to process Chinese language characters. This suggests that TopSec likely developed Sparta as an in-house solution that is tailored to the localized needs of TopSec’s customers and does not rely on a US-based solution.</p>
<p>Additionally, we observed a note indicating that detection alerts considered severe are likely distributed to internal teams via WeChat for prioritized handling. WeChat is a widely-used messaging and social media platform in China, known for its broad range of features, including messaging, social networking, and payment services. Its integration into daily life makes it an essential tool for communication and business operations within the country.</p>
<pre>
Severe monitoring events are sent to corporate WeChat
</pre>
<p>Since WeChat operates under Chinese regulations, there are significant implications regarding data privacy and government access. Under Chinese laws, such as the <a href="https://digichina.stanford.edu/work/translation-cybersecurity-law-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china-effective-june-1-2017/">Cybersecurity Law</a>, companies like Tencent, which owns WeChat, are required to cooperate with government entities, allowing them to access data when requested.</p>
<h2>Web Content Monitoring</h2>
<p>Our analysis found that TopSec’s capabilities include web content monitoring, as indicated by references to a service called <code>Website Monitoring Service</code> and detection events with internal identifiers prefixed with <code>Web</code>, such as <code>WebTamper</code>, <code>WebHiddenLink</code>, <code>WebAvailHttp</code>, <code>WebDns</code>, <code>WebTr</code>, and <code>WebSensitive</code>.</p>
<p>This feature of the platform is likely part of what would have been proposed in response to the bid issued by the Shanghai Pudong Bureau for the &#8220;Cloud Monitoring Service Project&#8221;, offering the Bureau tools to monitor website security and content as part of their broader surveillance and compliance efforts.</p>
<pre>
Inspect website monitoring-related services
[ . . . ]
[2024-06-12T18:00:00 to 2024-06-12T22:00:00 Event volume: 553] 2024-06-12T18:00:00 to 2024-06-12T22:00:00 Event volume: 553
WebSensitive 56
WebTamper 149
WebHiddenLink 348
</pre>
<p>While the exact logic behind how the Web events are triggered remains unclear, the event names and metadata present in the documents provide insight into the purpose of some of these events. For instance, the <code>WebAvailHttp</code> event is likely triggered when a website is considered unavailable due to its response time (measured in milliseconds as <code>respTimeMs</code> in the figure below) exceeding a predefined threshold (<code>respThresholdMs</code>).</p>
<figure id="attachment_114595" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-114595" style="width: 330px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_17.jpg" alt="Metadata on the WebAvailHttp event" width="330" height="357" class="size-full wp-image-114595" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_17.jpg 330w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_17-277x300.jpg 277w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 330px) 100vw, 330px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-114595" class="wp-caption-text">Metadata on the <em>WebAvailHttp</em> event</figcaption></figure>
<p>Further, the <code>WebHiddenLink</code> event is likely triggered when web content contains hidden links — links that obscure their destination or mislead users, posing a security risk. Examples include links concealed within small or transparent elements, deceptive anchor text, and styling tricks that make links appear as plain text.</p>
<figure id="attachment_114601" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-114601" style="width: 423px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_11.jpg" alt="The WebHiddenLink event" width="423" height="92" class="size-full wp-image-114601" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_11.jpg 423w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_11-300x65.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 423px) 100vw, 423px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-114601" class="wp-caption-text">The <em>WebHiddenLink</em> event</figcaption></figure>
<h3>Web Content Monitoring | Sensitive Words</h3>
<p>The <code>WebSensitive</code> event is likely triggered when web content contains so-called <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2211695822000897">sensitive words</a> (敏感词 in Simplified Chinese). These words are related to political criticism, violence, or pornography, and are central to China&#8217;s domestic Internet censorship efforts aimed at ensuring compliance with government policies. Detecting the presence of such words in web content helps prevent the dissemination of information considered inappropriate or harmful by PRC authorities.</p>
<pre>
Assist the product to check for missed scans and manual analysis and marking errors of sensitive word events
</pre>
<p>TopSec’s ability to detect sensitive words demonstrates the impact that state policies related to the cyber domain have on the design and implementation of monitoring solutions developed by the private sector in China. These policies shape the strategies and technologies used to monitor, filter, and control online content, ensuring that IT systems comply with governmental regulations and censorship guidelines.</p>
<p><code>WebSensitive</code> alerts may be used by private sector organizations to monitor user-generated content on their websites in order to trigger actions such as issuing warnings, deleting content, or restricting access when sensitive words are detected. Government entities may also consume these alerts to track the presence of sensitive words on their own websites or across broader online spaces to enforce compliance with national censorship regulations. For example, the latter may have been an objective of the previously mentioned &#8220;Cloud Monitoring Service Project&#8221; by the Shanghai Pudong Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security.</p>
<p>We observed a task list indicating a focused effort to ensure consistent monitoring for sensitive words between 7:00 AM and 8:00 AM on the 14th (converted from GMT to China Standard Time), with the month and year not specified. The preceding document content suggests that the reference is to September 2023. One item in the task list instructs verification of the availability and capacity of sensitive word detection capabilities during this period, while another item records the forwarding of &#8216;asset identifiers&#8217; for collected &#8216;validated events&#8217; to an individual named Zhao Nannan (赵楠楠). The task list issuing this instruction very likely includes a typo stating the validated events were from 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM on September 14.</p>

2. 	Check the number of agents for sensitive words between 23:00 on the 13th (GMT) and 14:00 at 00:00 (排查敏感词13日23点到14点0点之间的代办数量) 2h
3. 	Check cloud baseline 500 errors 1h
4. 	Collect asset identifiers of valid events on the 13th and provide them to Zhao Nannan 1h
5. 	Check the task execution failure of ipv6 probe 1h

<p>The identification of an individual named Zhao Nannan as the likely recipient of this information, alongside the context of the monitoring effort, leads us to conclude with moderate confidence that this effort was in response to political events in Shanghai.</p>
<p>We identified a woman named Zhao Nannan as having worked at the 3rd Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security in Shanghai, which is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240622033538/https://www.trimps.ac.cn/gass/index.html">responsible</a> for network security and technical investigations. Our observations presented earlier in this post suggest close ties between Shanghai-based Bureaus of the Ministry of Public Security and TopSec, one example being TopSec&#8217;s participation in a project bidding process launched by the Shanghai Pudong Bureau.</p>

<p>However, Zhao Nannan no longer works for the MPS 3rd Bureau in Shanghai. According to an online announcement from the Shanghai State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), Zhao Nannan was one of six successful applicants to SASAC for a network security role. The announcement even references her past role at the MPS 3rd Bureau. Congratulations are due to her, as she scored the highest among the applicants for the role–恭喜!</p>

<p>On the morning of September 14th, when Zhao Nannan received alerts for sensitive content, her new employer announced on its WeChat account that the head of the Shanghai SASAC, Bai Tinghui, was under investigation for corruption. The news was quickly picked up by the South China Morning Post, Caixing, and other news-reposting blogs in China. The Shanghai government itself confirmed the investigation into Bai Tinghui and his subsequent dismissal one month later.</p>

<p>Because the Shanghai SASAC posted the news on WeChat, we know that the investigation itself was not subject to censorship. The lack of complete censorship regarding the investigation raises questions about what “validated events” would have been reported to Zhao Nannan following the announcement.</p>
<p>Currently, only five webpages of the Shanghai SASAC still mention Bai Tinghui. All five pages also mention Bai leading a Party study session of Xi Jinping Thought. It’s unclear why only these pages of Bai Tinghui remain–perhaps his tarnished reputation is outshown by Xi Jinping: it may be hard to delete a website with Xi Jinping’s name on it, even if it is accompanied by a corrupt local official.</p>
<figure id="attachment_114599" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-114599" style="width: 1088px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_13.jpg" alt="Search results that still show Bai Tinghui’s name on SASAC website" width="1088" height="1778" class="size-full wp-image-114599" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_13.jpg 1088w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_13-184x300.jpg 184w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_13-627x1024.jpg 627w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_13-768x1255.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_13-940x1536.jpg 940w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1088px) 100vw, 1088px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-114599" class="wp-caption-text">Search results that still show Bai Tinghui’s name on SASAC website</figcaption></figure>
<p>Intriguingly, the organization that is responsible for investigating the fallen Bai Tinghui, the Shanghai Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection, is listed among TopSec’s customers in the tooling.</p>
<p>The downfall of Bai Tinghui and the resulting use of Beijing TopSec’s tooling for coordinated monitoring of politically sensitive content shines a light on the important role cybersecurity companies can play in Chinese politics. The CCP has <a href="https://www.newamerica.org/cybersecurity-initiative/blog/chinas-strategic-thinking-building-power-cyberspace/">long-acknowledged</a> that “If our party cannot traverse the hurdle represented by the Internet, it cannot traverse the hurdle of remaining in power for the long term.” This episode provides a compelling example of how corruption investigations expand to rely on the institutions of those being investigated and the cybersecurity companies that service them.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>These leaks yield insight into the complex ecosystem of relationships between government entities and China’s private sector cybersecurity companies. While many countries have significant overlap between government requirements and private sector cybersecurity firms, the ties between these entities in China are much deeper and represent the state’s grasp on managing public opinion through online enforcement.</p>
<p>The September 2023 situation in Shanghai provides insight into how local and national government interests are enforced through private sector partnerships. The CCP’s strategy of controlling information is multifaceted and requires significant investment in resources that enable the monitoring and alteration of content that citizens engage with. While there are still many unknown factors regarding how such censorship is applied, these findings yield insights into how collaboration occurs between the government and other entities in China.</p>
<p>The nature of how this data was leaked remains unclear, but the materials show that TopSec engineers were documenting their work in a highly granular way that included entire commands used to perform the outlined tasks. Considering the types of information in this leak, organizations should evaluate how their systems and infrastructure engineers are logging work. Proper credential management is essential to securing sensitive environments. Infrastructure engineers should rely on a secrets manager that integrates with the CI/CD pipeline rather than running commands from playbooks that include hardcoded credentials. This results in only variable names being stored in commands instead of sensitive credentials and lowers the likelihood that an unexpected disclosure could result in further compromise.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[SentinelLABS has observed an active phishing campaign targeting high-profile X accounts to hijack and exploit them for fraudulent activity.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>An active phishing campaign is targeting high-profile X accounts in an attempt to hijack and exploit them for fraudulent activity.</li>
<li>This campaign has been observed targeting a variety of individual and organization accounts such as U.S. political figures, leading international journalists, an X employee, large technology organizations, cryptocurrency organizations, and owners of valuable, short usernames.</li>
<li>SentinelLABS’ analysis links this activity to a similar operation from last year that successfully compromised multiple accounts to spread scam content with financial objectives. While the activity detailed here is centered around X/Twitter accounts, this actor is not limited to a single social platform, and can be observed directing attention to other popular services as well, while seemingly pursuing the same financial objectives.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve encountered similar suspicious activity, SentinelLABS would love to hear from you — please reach out to the team at <a href="mailto:ThreatTips@sentinelone.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ThreatTips@sentinelone.com</a>.</p>
<h2>Account Compromise Process</h2>
<p>Thanks to tips from targets and collaboration with industry partners, SentinelLABS has observed a variety of phishing lures tied to this campaign over the past few weeks. One example is the classic account login notice. The links in the email received by the target are not legitimate and lead to credential phishing sites. Other observed lures use copyright violation themes. However, SentinelLABS notes that directly phishing users may not be the only access method employed by this attacker.</p>
<figure id="attachment_113633" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-113633" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-113633 size-full" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/new-login-phishing-email.jpg" alt="" width="760" height="1320" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/new-login-phishing-email.jpg 760w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/new-login-phishing-email-173x300.jpg 173w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/new-login-phishing-email-590x1024.jpg 590w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-113633" class="wp-caption-text">An X ‘new login’-themed phishing email</figcaption></figure>
<p>In recent cases, we observed the actor abusing Google&#8217;s &#8220;AMP Cache&#8221; domain <code>cdn.ampproject[.]org</code> to evade email detections and redirect the user to a phishing domain:</p>
<pre>https://cdn.ampproject[.]org/c/s/x-recoverysupport.com/reset/?username=[X-USERNAME]</pre>
<p>This ultimately leads the targets to an actor-made phishing website seeking X account credentials:</p>
<figure id="attachment_113632" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-113632" style="width: 684px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-113632 size-full" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/x-creds-phishing-page.jpg" alt="" width="684" height="792" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/x-creds-phishing-page.jpg 684w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/x-creds-phishing-page-259x300.jpg 259w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 684px) 100vw, 684px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-113632" class="wp-caption-text">X credential phishing page</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the copyright infringement lure scenario, the user will first visit an Action Needed page before being prompted to enter credentials:</p>
<figure id="attachment_113631" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-113631" style="width: 1514px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-113631" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/x-fake-copyright-infringement.jpg" alt="" width="1514" height="786" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/x-fake-copyright-infringement.jpg 1514w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/x-fake-copyright-infringement-300x156.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/x-fake-copyright-infringement-1024x532.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/x-fake-copyright-infringement-768x399.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1514px) 100vw, 1514px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-113631" class="wp-caption-text">X fake copyright infringement page</figcaption></figure>
<p>Once an account is taken over, the attacker swiftly locks out the legitimate owner and begins posting fraudulent cryptocurrency opportunities or links to external sites designed to lure additional targets, often with a crypto theft-related theme. Ultimately, compromising high-profile accounts enables the attacker to reach a broader audience of potential secondary victims, maximizing their financial gains.</p>
<h2>Widespread Activity</h2>
<p>In recent activity associated with this campaign, the domain <code>securelogins-x[.]com</code> has been used to deliver emails and <code>x-recoverysupport[.]com</code> to host phishing pages. Our observations indicate a level of informality and flexibility of infrastructure use – meaning any of these domains can be considered email delivery or phishing page hosting.</p>
<p>An overall collection of recent activity can be observed hosted on <code>84.38.130[.]20</code>, an IP associated with a Belize-based VPS service called Dataclub. The domains themselves have been predominantly registered through Turkish hosting provider Turkticaret.</p>
<p>Inspecting the DNS history of <code>84.38.130[.]20</code> leads to a variety of interestingly related domains. As shown below, the cluster of activity began in mid-2024 and continues today. While this is only one phishing page hosting IP, it provides a good perspective of the length of this activity and its ability to avoid much attention for over a year.</p>
<figure id="attachment_113630" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-113630" style="width: 1558px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-113630" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/validin-infrastructure-analysis.jpg" alt="" width="1558" height="886" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/validin-infrastructure-analysis.jpg 1558w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/validin-infrastructure-analysis-300x171.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/validin-infrastructure-analysis-1024x582.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/validin-infrastructure-analysis-768x437.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/validin-infrastructure-analysis-1536x873.jpg 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1558px) 100vw, 1558px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-113630" class="wp-caption-text">Validin Infrastructure Analysis Timeline</figcaption></figure>
<p>Our observations suggest that the attacker is highly adaptable, continuously exploring new techniques while maintaining a clear financial motive. The targeting appears constrained, yet opportunistic. Notably, past public reports have attributed related activity to Turkish-speaking actors based on language phishing page source comment language. At this time, we do not attribute this campaign to a specific country or any widely-tracked threat actor.</p>
<p>Some of the malicious sites and content hosted across <code>84.38.130[.]20</code> are built using the FASTPANEL DIRECT service.</p>
<figure id="attachment_113629" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-113629" style="width: 1046px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-113629" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/FASTPANEL-landing-page.jpg" alt="" width="1046" height="836" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/FASTPANEL-landing-page.jpg 1046w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/FASTPANEL-landing-page-300x240.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/FASTPANEL-landing-page-1024x818.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/FASTPANEL-landing-page-768x614.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1046px) 100vw, 1046px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-113629" class="wp-caption-text">FASTPANEL landing page on buy-tanai[.]com</figcaption></figure>
<p>FASTPANEL is a website hosting and building service that specializes in rapid building and management of websites. While FASTPANEL is not a malicious service, it is frequently abused by bad actors due to the ease of use, rapid scalability, and relatively low cost. FASTPANEL is routinely utilized by drainer gains and phishing campaigns, and is also included in associated guides and tutorials distributed throughout cybercrime communication channels.</p>
<figure id="attachment_113628" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-113628" style="width: 1556px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-113628" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/example-discussion-FASTPANEL.jpg" alt="" width="1556" height="664" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/example-discussion-FASTPANEL.jpg 1556w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/example-discussion-FASTPANEL-300x128.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/example-discussion-FASTPANEL-1024x437.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/example-discussion-FASTPANEL-768x328.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/example-discussion-FASTPANEL-1536x655.jpg 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1556px) 100vw, 1556px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-113628" class="wp-caption-text">Example discussion of FASTPANEL (RU crime forum)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Of the sites hosted on <code>84.38.130[.]20</code>, the <code>buy-tanai[.]com</code> and <code>emotionai[.]live</code> sites still present the FASTPANEL landing pages as of this writing.</p>
<h2>Publicly Linkable Activity</h2>
<h3>Emerging Account Intrusions</h3>
<p>While we have not yet established a high-confidence link, a recent compromise of a Tor Project account closely mirrors our observations. On January 30, 2025, the official X account for the Tor Project was breached. While it is possible that the same threat actor is responsible, we lack sufficient evidence to confirm the connection as of this writing.</p>
<figure id="attachment_113627" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-113627" style="width: 1534px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-113627" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/x-tor-project-potential-comp.jpg" alt="" width="1534" height="1018" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/x-tor-project-potential-comp.jpg 1534w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/x-tor-project-potential-comp-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/x-tor-project-potential-comp-1024x680.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/x-tor-project-potential-comp-768x510.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1534px) 100vw, 1534px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-113627" class="wp-caption-text">X post from The Tor Project account on January 30, 2025 advising users of a potential compromise</figcaption></figure>

<p>The Decentralized Autonomous Wireless Network (DAWN) was another victim of this type of attack. The threat actor <a href="https://coinpedia.org/news/dawn-internets-x-account-hacked-phishing-scams-target-users-via-telegram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leveraged</a> the compromised DAWN-related social media accounts to lure victims into entering credentials into phishing pages targeting X and Telegram credentials.</p>
<figure id="attachment_113625" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-113625" style="width: 1354px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-113625" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DAWN-x-post.jpg" alt="" width="1354" height="1358" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DAWN-x-post.jpg 1354w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DAWN-x-post-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DAWN-x-post-1021x1024.jpg 1021w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DAWN-x-post-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DAWN-x-post-768x770.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DAWN-x-post-50x50.jpg 50w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DAWN-x-post-24x24.jpg 24w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1354px) 100vw, 1354px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-113625" class="wp-caption-text">DAWN X Posts</figcaption></figure>
<p>The compromise of DAWN’s X accounts goes back to mid-January 2025.</p>
<figure id="attachment_113624" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-113624" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-113624" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DAWN-rewards-comp-post.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="1106" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DAWN-rewards-comp-post.jpg 960w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DAWN-rewards-comp-post-260x300.jpg 260w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DAWN-rewards-comp-post-889x1024.jpg 889w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DAWN-rewards-comp-post-768x885.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-113624" class="wp-caption-text">January 14, 2025 &#8211; DAWN rewards compromise post</figcaption></figure>
<h3>Crypto-Themed Project Placeholders</h3>
<p>In some cases, we’ve observed cryptocurrency themed projects seemingly acting as placeholders for future use, or direct pump-and-dump schemes. In one example, <code>buy-tanai[.]com</code> was <a href="https://pump.fun/coin/G8pMUeoRVVDQu2hJSzxNPBGWtgtt5BjQ9nCT2BmVpump" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pitched</a> as such: “<i>$TANA AI. Dawn&#8217;s AI project, Tana is the first AI-powered LP and trading agent, now live on the Solana blockchain.”</i></p>
<figure id="attachment_113623" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-113623" style="width: 1516px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-113623" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/tana-ai-pump-fun.jpg" alt="" width="1516" height="338" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/tana-ai-pump-fun.jpg 1516w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/tana-ai-pump-fun-300x67.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/tana-ai-pump-fun-1024x228.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/tana-ai-pump-fun-768x171.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1516px) 100vw, 1516px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-113623" class="wp-caption-text">Tana AI (TANA) on Pump[.]fun</figcaption></figure>
<p>The domain<code>buy-tanai[.]com</code> currently displays default FASTPANEL landing pages, suggesting it — along with other similar domains — is being staged for future attacks. Since FASTPANEL-managed sites can be rapidly updated, these domains serve as adaptable templates for phishing campaigns.</p>
<p>Notably, TANA AI (TANA) was launched by Dawn in mid-January to promote AI-driven trading and liquidity provision in the cryptocurrency market. Despite losing most of its initial value within days, the currency remains actively traded across multiple decentralized exchanges.</p>
<p>Given the crypto-related nature of these domains, it is likely that threat actors are using them as flexible phishing infrastructure. By keeping them as blank templates, they can quickly modify hosted content to align with ongoing campaigns as needed.</p>
<h3>Crimeware Relations</h3>
<p>Several other domains share overlaps in both use and unique infrastructure details, yet they represent a fork from the previously described high-profile social media profile attacks, including:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">dataoptimix[.]com</li>
<li aria-level="1">gamecodestudios[.]com</li>
<li aria-level="1">shortwayscooter[.]com</li>
</ul>
<p>The domain <code>shortwayscooter[.]com</code> <a href="https://x.com/JAMESWT_MHT/status/1883780543797723223" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hosts</a> fake captchas that deliver the DanaBot banking trojan. DataOptimix is branded as a generative AI solution, though there are few details about what the service does.</p>
<figure id="attachment_113622" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-113622" style="width: 1474px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-113622" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/dataoptimix.jpg" alt="" width="1474" height="1236" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/dataoptimix.jpg 1474w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/dataoptimix-300x252.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/dataoptimix-1024x859.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/dataoptimix-768x644.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1474px) 100vw, 1474px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-113622" class="wp-caption-text">DataOptimix</figcaption></figure>
<h3>Historical Connections</h3>
<p>In mid-2024, a campaign used related infrastructure in similar phishing messages, including those which <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/streamers/news-linus-sebastian-responds-linus-tech-tips-official-x-account-got-hacked" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">compromised the Linus Tech Tips</a> Twitter account along with several other high profile users. At the time, @LinusTech had roughly 1.8million followers, which may represent the highest profile account successfully hijacked and linked to this actor.</p>
<figure id="attachment_113621" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-113621" style="width: 852px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-113621" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/linus-tech-tips-compromise.jpg" alt="" width="852" height="1556" srcset="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/linus-tech-tips-compromise.jpg 852w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/linus-tech-tips-compromise-164x300.jpg 164w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/linus-tech-tips-compromise-561x1024.jpg 561w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/linus-tech-tips-compromise-768x1403.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/linus-tech-tips-compromise-841x1536.jpg 841w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 852px) 100vw, 852px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-113621" class="wp-caption-text">Linus Tech Tips Twitter compromise</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The cryptocurrency landscape offers financially-motivated threat actors multiple opportunities for profit and fraud. While marketing for coins and tokens has long been irreverent and meme-driven, recent developments have further blurred the line between legitimate projects and scams. </p>
<p>A striking example occurred in January 2025, when the X account of the late crypto-enthusiast and antivirus founder John McAfee was reactivated to promote a new coin, <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/john-mcafee-reborn-as-ai-memecoin-and-chatbot-with-27-million-market-cap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$AIntivirus</a>. The marketing style and brand voice of this purportedly legitimate token closely resemble tactics used in known scam campaigns, highlighting how easily crypto enthusiasts can be misled in an already murky ecosystem.</p>
<p>To safeguard your X account, we strongly recommend using a unique password, enabling two-factor authentication (2FA), and avoiding credential sharing with third-party services.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Chinese foreign direct investment should trigger American national security concerns, but much of it doesn’t. In this ‘behind closed doors’ talk at LABScon 24, Elly Rostoum reveals why and what can be done to improve our understanding of the influence of Chinese FDI.</span></p>
<p>Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) enabled the technology revolution in China and set China as a strategic competitor to the United States. It opened new global markets, redrew trade routes, tapped into intellectual property, allowed for opportunities in industrial espionage, reshaped supply chains, and allowed for technological breakthroughs in genomics, quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and other critical and emerging technologies that are quite simply re-imagining the world.</p>
<p>But who exactly owns the Chinese firms undertaking this FDI?</p>
<p>The research presented by <a href="https://www.labscon.io/speakers/elly-rostoum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elly Rostoum</a> in this LABScon 2024 keynote address tracks the incorporation structures and ownership of the 672 Chinese firms undertaking FDI globally.</p>
<p>Taking the audience on a journey from how Chinese FDI triggers &#8211; and sometimes fails to trigger &#8211;  American national security concerns to the complex ownership structure of Chinese businesses operating within the U.S., Elly Rostoum reveals how the Chinese government has been able to evade American national security reviews by instrumentalizing investment through 3rd &amp; 4th+ level subsidiaries, private equity, and holding companies.</p>
<p>While much policy and attention has been focused on the investments of Chinese state-owned enterprises, Elly Rostoum argues that the real threat is “within” and buried in the details: seemingly “American” businesses that are ultimately owned by Chinese investment companies.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Martin Wendiggensen reveals how disinformation shaped Taiwan’s election, and how AI-powered research uncovered hidden influences on voter behavior. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AI disinformation, deep fakes, armies of lying bots, and automated deception is the biggest threat to our elections, or so we’ve been told. But looking at Taiwan’s 2024 election, none of these nightmare scenarios materialized. The deafening silence of effective AI disinformation from China, America’s most advanced opponent, was surprising. Even more so given the focus on the election at the highest levels of the Chinese government.</p>
<p>In this highly-engaging talk, Martin Wendiggensen details how he set out to study the election and collected tens of thousands of hours of footage from YouTube and television as well as hundreds of thousands of news articles, blog posts, and social media content. This collection was then analyzed with a multi-modal AI pipeline. The results indicated that the small amount of AI-content received no engagement and had no impact.</p>
<p>Instead, Taiwanese billionaires earning most of their money in China mounted a concerted effort to buy or set up local news outlets in Taiwan in the run-up to the election. Conducting a large-scale analysis of these outlets’ output uncovered interesting results. Their viewership, numbering in the millions, presented slanted narratives aligned with the Beijing-friendly KMT and a new emergent third party. While losing the presidential election, these two parties managed to wrest control of Taiwan’s parliament and are set to have a major impact on the country’s foreign and domestic policies.</p>
<p>This presentation guides the audience through Chinese and local disinformation efforts in the Taiwanese election, highlighting the main lessons that can be drawn from them to safeguard future elections. Along the way, Martin explains the research methodology and toolbox that leverages open-source AI to fight disinformation.</p>
