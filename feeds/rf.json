One way advertisers achieve this is by using traffic distribution systems (TDSs), which collect information about potential customers to <a href=\"https://www.securitee.org/files/tds-www2021.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">direct</a> them to highly targeted ads. Using data from the users browser, geolocation, and behavior, a TDS makes rapid decisions on directing traffic to get the most from ad spend. However, cybercriminals also use this infrastructure to deliver highly targeted malware to victims who are most likely to click their links. Malicious TDSs work in much the same way as legitimate TDSs, except they direct victims to the most effective malware instead of the most effective advertisement. Additionally, these TDSs provide a defensive measure to ensure the malware is not delivered to researchers or sandboxes that could analyze the code.</p><p>Insikt Group has been tracking how cybercriminals use these tools and <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/tag-124-multi-layered-tds-infrastructure-extensive-user-base\" target=\"_blank\">identified</a> infrastructure linked to a highly active malicious TDS dubbed TAG-124. TAG-124 allows ransomware operators and other cybercriminals to maximize their chances of infecting their intended victims with their respective payloads. At least two ransomware groups have been observed using TAG-124 to infect victims in health care and other critical infrastructure, demonstrating the value of traffic distribution for big game hunting (targeting companies perceived as likely to pay out high extortion demands). While shared infrastructure like TAG-124 helps cybercriminals improve their efficiency and effectiveness, understanding TAG-124 infrastructure can help defenders block or even disable activity from multiple cyber threat actors simultaneously before compromise occurs.</p><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/hidden_01_4f5a2dd0de.png\" alt=\"hidden-01.png\"><em><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Multiple threat actors use TAG-124 to direct victims to their malware (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><h2 id=\"multiple-threat-actors-use-tag-124-infrastructure\">Multiple Threat Actors Use TAG-124 Infrastructure</h2><p>Insikt Group has observed multiple threat actors using this malicious TDS, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Rhysida Ransomware:</strong> A sophisticated <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/outmaneuvering-rhysida-advanced-threat-intelligence-shields-critical-infrastructure-ransomware\" target=\"_blank\">ransomware-as-a-service</a> operation notable for extorting healthcare organizations and other critical infrastructure. In 2023, the group claimed responsibility for an attack on Prospect Medical Holdings, which <a href=\"https://www.scworld.com/news/rhysida-claims-responsibility-for-ransomware-attacks-on-prospect-medical-holdings\" target=\"_blank\">resulted</a> in the theft of over 500,000 social security numbers and <a href=\"https://blog.barracuda.com/2024/05/09/rhysida-ransomware--the-creepy-crawling-criminal-hiding-in-the-d#:~:text=The%20Prospect%20Medical%20Holdings%20attack%20impacted%2017%20hospitals%20and%20166%20clinics%20across%20the%20United%20States.\" target=\"_blank\">impacted</a> operations at seventeen hospitals and 166 clinics. </li><li><strong>Interlock Ransomware:</strong> Another ransomware group targeting primarily <a href=\"https://www.hipaajournal.com/interlock-ransomware-healthcare/\" target=\"_blank\">healthcare organizations</a> and other big game to extort higher payouts through high-impact attacks on large organizations. In December 2024, the group <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/texas-tech-university-system-data-breach-impacts-14-million-patients/\" target=\"_blank\">claimed</a> credit for an attack on the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, stealing 2.6 TB of sensitive personal data. Interlock shares many similarities with Rhysida, such as tactics, tools, and encryption behaviors, though the exact relationship between the two is <a href=\"https://x.com/prodaft/status/1896938856672280591?s=43\" target=\"_blank\">unknown</a>.</li><li><strong>TA866 / Asylum Ambuscade:</strong> This cybercrime group <a href=\"https://www.welivesecurity.com/2023/06/08/asylum-ambuscade-crimeware-or-cyberespionage/\" target=\"_blank\">engages in</a> financial targeting and cyber espionage very likely on behalf of the Russian government. The group has targeted bank customers and cryptocurrency traders across North America and Europe and carried out <a href=\"https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/security-brief-ta866-returns-large-email-campaign\" target=\"_blank\">espionage</a> against government entities in Europe, Central Asia, and other areas.</li></ul><p>TAG-124 has also been associated with <a href=\"https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/part-1-socgholish-very-real-threat-very-fake-update\" target=\"_blank\">SocGholish</a> and <a href=\"https://www.esentire.com/blog/exploring-the-d3f-ck-malware-as-a-service-loader\" target=\"_blank\">D3F@ck</a> loader malware, which provide remote access and malware delivery for financially motivated activity. While Insikt Group does not know which criteria TAG-124 uses to filter and direct malicious content, its use of search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning and infecting legitimate sites allows for an enormous number of potential victims. By outsourcing initial infection to TAG-124, groups like Rhysida and Interlock can pursue big game hunting by specializing in techniques implemented during a later stage in the infection kill chain. These special techniques enable more effective extortion campaigns.</p><h3 id=\"risk-outlook\">Risk Outlook</h3><p>Successful big game hunting that results in large payouts allows sophisticated syndicates like Rhysida and Interlock to invest back into services that make their work more effective. This drives the increased specialization of groups like TAG-124, creating a virtuous cycle of cybercrime. As a result, businesses face an increasing risk of high-impact ransomware attacks and espionage-driven data theft: the links between TAG-124 and Asylum Ambuscade suggest that state-sponsored threat actors are also taking advantage of these services in addition to profit-motivated actors.</p><p>Defending against TAG-124 may be challenging due to its early role in the cyberattack life cycle, but missing intrusions early on can still have negative consequences for companies. For example, one of Rhysidas latest victims, Sunflower Medical, is <a href=\"https://www.hipaajournal.com/sunflower-medical-group-data-breach-lawsuit/\" target=\"_blank\">facing</a> a class action lawsuit because of its failure to implement security measures that would have detected the breach early in the infection cycle. According to the company, the intrusion was not discovered for three weeks following the initial breach. While it is unknown whether TAG-124 was used for this intrusion, the legal consequences demonstrate the significant risks of missing early signs of a breach.</p><h3 id=\"mitigations\">Mitigations</h3><p>TAG-124 is not the only TDS operating on behalf of threat actors. Other notable examples include <a href=\"https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/vextrio-tds-biggest-cybercrime-operation-web\" target=\"_blank\">VexTrio</a>, <a href=\"https://www.securityweek.com/prometheus-tds-underground-service-distributing-several-malware-families/\" target=\"_blank\">Prometheus TDS</a>, and <a href=\"https://sensorstechforum.com/blacktds-traffic-distribution-network-malicious/\" target=\"_blank\">BlackTDS</a>, all of which offer competing malware delivery capabilities. Operators of these systems enable the increasing effectiveness of many different threat actors  primarily criminal, though occasionally state-sponsored  by providing professional infrastructure that adopts legitimate content delivery techniques for criminal use. However, identifying indicators of malicious TDS can help defenders detect and block multiple threat actors early in the attack kill chain.</p><p>Insikt Group recommends the following measures:</p><ul><li><strong>Advanced threat detection:</strong> In addition to blocking known indicators, use host- and log-based detections, such as YARA, Snort, and Sigma rules found in Recorded Futures Intelligence Cloud, for custom file scanning and detection. These detections can help identify unwanted tools or other suspicious activity.</li><li><strong>User education:</strong> Educate users on the risks of SEO poisoning and urge caution when browsing. In particular, urge caution against unprompted downloads for Google Chrome updates and other indicators associated with TAG-124 infrastructure.</li><li><strong>Secure browser setting:</strong> Enable automatic browser updates and blocking pop-ups to reduce exposure to malicious update prompts.</li></ul><p>For more information on TAG-124 and other emerging threats in malware, check out Insikt Groups <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/2024-malicious-infrastructure-report\" target=\"_blank\">2024 Malicious Infrastructure Report</a>.</p>","content:encodedSnippet":"Coming across highly targeted advertisements online is a common experience for many US consumers.

The group has targeted bank customers and cryptocurrency traders across North America and Europe and carried out espionage against government entities in Europe, Central Asia, and other areas.\n\nTAG-124 has also been associated with SocGholish and D3F@ck loader malware, which provide remote access and malware delivery for financially motivated activity. While Insikt Group does not know which criteria TAG-124 uses to filter and direct malicious content, its use of search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning and infecting legitimate sites allows for an enormous number of potential victims. By outsourcing initial infection to TAG-124, groups like Rhysida and Interlock can pursue big game hunting by specializing in techniques implemented during a later stage in the infection kill chain. These special techniques enable more effective extortion campaigns.\nRisk Outlook\nSuccessful big game hunting that results in large payouts allows sophisticated syndicates like Rhysida and Interlock to invest back into services that make their work more effective. This drives the increased specialization of groups like TAG-124, creating a virtuous cycle of cybercrime. As a result, businesses face an increasing risk of high-impact ransomware attacks and espionage-driven data theft: the links between TAG-124 and Asylum Ambuscade suggest that state-sponsored threat actors are also taking advantage of these services in addition to profit-motivated actors.\nDefending against TAG-124 may be challenging due to its early role in the cyberattack life cycle, but missing intrusions early on can still have negative consequences for companies. For example, one of Rhysidas latest victims, Sunflower Medical, is facing a class action lawsuit because of its failure to implement security measures that would have detected the breach early in the infection cycle. According to the company, the intrusion was not discovered for three weeks following the initial breach. While it is unknown whether TAG-124 was used for this intrusion, the legal consequences demonstrate the significant risks of missing early signs of a breach.\nMitigations\nTAG-124 is not the only TDS operating on behalf of threat actors. Other notable examples include VexTrio, Prometheus TDS, and BlackTDS, all of which offer competing malware delivery capabilities. Operators of these systems enable the increasing effectiveness of many different threat actors  primarily criminal, though occasionally state-sponsored  by providing professional infrastructure that adopts legitimate content delivery techniques for criminal use. However, identifying indicators of malicious TDS can help defenders detect and block multiple threat actors early in the attack kill chain.\nInsikt Group recommends the following measures:\n\nAdvanced threat detection: In addition to blocking known indicators, use host- and log-based detections, such as YARA, Snort, and Sigma rules found in Recorded Futures Intelligence Cloud, for custom file scanning and detection. These detections can help identify unwanted tools or other suspicious activity.\nUser education: Educate users on the risks of SEO poisoning and urge caution when browsing. In particular, urge caution against unprompted downloads for Google Chrome updates and other indicators associated with TAG-124 infrastructure.\nSecure browser setting: Enable automatic browser updates and blocking pop-ups to reduce exposure to malicious update prompts.\n\nFor more information on TAG-124 and other emerging threats in malware, check out Insikt Groups 2024 Malicious Infrastructure Report.","enclosure":{"url":"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/format_webp/2025_0422_Blog_Hidden_Infrastructure_Main_Feature_a5450ebcab.jpg","length":"0","type":"image/jpg"},"content":"Discover how cybercriminals use malicious Traffic Distribution Systems like TAG-124 to deliver ransomware and malware to high-value targets in healthcare and critical infrastructure.","contentSnippet":"Discover how cybercriminals use malicious Traffic Distribution Systems like TAG-124 to deliver ransomware and malware to high-value targets in healthcare and critical infrastructure.","guid":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/massive-hidden-infrastructure-enabling-big-game-hunting-at-scale","categories":["Blog"],"isoDate":"2025-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","tag":"intel"},{"title":"When vulnerability information flows are vulnerable themselves","link":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/when-vulnerability-information-flows-are-vulnerable-themselves","pubDate":"Fri, 18 Apr 2025 00:00:00 GMT","content:encoded":"<h2 id=\"what-we-can-learn-from-the-recent-news-about-the-unknown-future-of-mitres-cve-database\">What We Can Learn From The Recent News About the Unknown Future of MITREs CVE Database</h2><p>Over the last several days, we have received a lot of inquiries from customers and partners about the recent news on the unknown future of the MITRE National Vulnerability (NVD) database.

Since the Supreme Leader issued a directive in 2021, Iran has endeavored to develop a national strategy and oversight mechanism for AI and foster a technological ecosystem to drive domestic research and development. However, two key factors  Tehrans global economic isolation, and its deeply entrenched system of government control and oversight  have almost certainly hindered Irans national AI development. </p><p>In 2024, as Tehrans support for its proxies Hamas and Hezbollah against Israel embroiled Iran in unprecedented regional conflicts and ongoing cyberwarfare, new insights emerged about how Iran has implemented AI technologies in its national security apparatus. Iran has used AI to bolster its capabilities in four main areas: cyberattacks, influence operations, military and intelligence systems, and domestic repression. These priorities will continue to propel Irans development and implementation of AI, almost certainly posing an increasing threat to Irans Western and regional adversaries. In cyberspace, AI will likely augment Iranian threat actors spearphishing and social engineering tradecraft, while AIs implementation in Irans drone and missile arsenal is likely to pose the greatest physical threat from emerging technology.</p><p>Irans approach to AI will likely mirror its broader strategic ambitions  to be a regional power and assert its national sovereignty  by building and implementing advanced technological capabilities. Iranian government initiatives are likely to be the driving force behind Irans AI development priorities, particularly given the absence of a flourishing AI private sector. While Tehran will promote its own technological prowess and indigenous AI development, the Iranian government is likely to leverage its relationship with China and Russia in various security realms to bolster its AI technology capabilities. Private industry, particularly companies in the AI or technology resources industry, should closely monitor end users of their models or materials to ensure Iranian threat actors are not using their products or acquiring controlled technologies. Similarly, governments should invest in identifying and preventing the Iranian defense industry from acquiring AI technologies that enhance its military capabilities. </p><h2 id=\"key-findings\">Key Findings</h2><ul><li>Iran has articulated lofty goals for its AI advancement and seeks to compete in the global AI race, but it is almost certainly hindered by two factors: First, its economic and commercial isolation limits its access to technological resources and human capital. Second, its top-down government control and oversight stifles private innovation in AI.</li><li>To augment its own indigenous research and development (R&amp;D) capabilities in AI, Iran will likely leverage its bilateral and regional relationships for technology engagement with China, Russia, and other non-Western countries.</li><li>Amidst unprecedented domestic upheaval and regional conflict over the last three years, Iran very likely views AI as a key force multiplier for its national security and defense and has sought to integrate AI into its cyber and influence operations, military systems, and domestic surveillance infrastructure.</li><li>It is very likely that Iranian threat actors will increasingly use generative AI and large language models (LLMs) to enhance their influence and cyber operations, increasing risk to adversarial governments, as well as their critical infrastructure, technology companies, and other security-related industries. </li><li>Iran has very likely endeavored to implement AI in its military defense systems and publicly touts the capability, though its operational uses of the technologies remain unproven.</li><li>In the domestic sphere, Iran has very likely increased its efforts to deploy AI for morality enforcement and opposition monitoring, to enhance its control over Iranian society, particularly after the Woman Life Freedom protest movement.</li><li>Companies and governments should maintain vigilance in cybersecurity practices to reduce vulnerabilities to AI-enabled cyber and influence operations and limit Irans access to AI resources and expertise that could increase Tehrans threat to regional security.</li></ul><h2 id=\"irans-ai-ambitions\">Irans AI Ambitions</h2><p>At the highest level of its leadership, Iran has recognized and sought to develop an overarching national focus on AI (   in Persian). In November 2021, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei called AI an important and futuristic issue that will play a role in the future administration of the world, and <a href=\"https://www.memri.org/reports/irans-supreme-leader-khamenei-we-must-master-all-layers-artificial-intelligence-technology\" target=\"_blank\">urged</a> Iran to become a top ten country in the field of AI. In August 2024, Khamenei urged Iran to master and develop the deep and diverse layers of AI technology, warning that a global oversight body (similar to the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]) might regulate its use in the future. Khameneis stated ambition for Irans AI prominence initiated a flurry of government-led activity to develop and implement a national strategy and technological ecosystem to align with the Supreme Leaders intent. Iran subsequently began creating a national AI roadmap that evaluated the strategic documents of 23 countries in the field of AI and developed a plan to realize Khameneis goal by 2032. The goals of the roadmap document were to achieve 80 percent of research to meet the needs of the country, use of 45 percent of AI in industries, $8 billion investment in AI, and a 12 percent share of AI in the GDP.&quot; The document contained fourteen macro policies, 47 micro-policies, 39 general actions, and 155 projects and activities. According to the roadmap, by the Persian year 1410 (starting March 2031), Iran would need to train 600,000 experts in the AI field to accomplish these objectives.</p><p>Irans presidency  specifically, the Vice Presidency for Science, Technology and Knowledge-based Economy  oversees the Iranian governments effort to establish and implement an AI strategy. On December 3, 2023, President Ebrahim Raisi issued an executive order to establish the National Steering Committee and the National Artificial Intelligence (AI) Center, which would focus on creating integrated AI processing and data service providers, aligning with the countrys needs, and implementing large-scale AI projects.&quot;  He appointed Reshad Hosseini as Secretary for the Development of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Headquarters, a role intended to develop a technology development roadmap and to make maximum use of all the internal capacity of the innovation ecosystem.&quot; Irans AI Strategic Council was to be formed of ministers and heads of relevant institutions to implement, coordinate, and monitor a National AI Document.</p><p>After Raisis death in May 2024, the administration of President Masoud Pezeshkian has continued to emphasize Irans AI strategy. The National AI Organization (or the National Organization for AI) was inaugurated in July 2024 in Tehran. Insikt Group identified the organizations physical location in north central Tehran, on Molla Sadra Street (Figures 1-3). During Pezeshkians endorsement ceremony and National Government Week meeting in August 2024, Khamenei advised the new administration that the good initiative begun under deceased President Raisi unfortunately remains unfinished, but advised that the National AI Organization, under the direct supervision of the President, should continue Raisis progress. On October 15, 2024, Irans Information Technology Council issued a decision that within two months, the National Organization of Artificial Intelligence should present to the working group the requirements for creating, developing, maintaining and publishing data and information in the hyper scale database of artificial intelligence.&quot; </p><p>Pezeshkian appointed Hossein Afshin, a professor of mechanical engineering at Sharif University of Technology, as his Vice President for Science, Technology, and Knowledge-based Economy, who also serves as the secretary and vice president of the National AI Organization and serves as the face of AI development within Iran. Pezeshkian also assigned his First Vice President, Dr. Mohammad Reza Aref, as chairman of the National AI Organization and its strategic council. Arefs appointment as First Vice President <a href=\"https://amwaj.media/en/media-monitor/critics-slam-return-of-lord-of-silence-as-iran-s-first-vice-president\" target=\"_blank\">prompted</a> criticism for his political obscurity, likely reflecting Pezeshkians choice for the position was based on his scientific prowess and technical acuity rather than his accomplishments as a reformist politician. The prominent role of Aref  who holds two advanced degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University, has been a professor at two prestigious Iranian universities, and has <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37300306900\" target=\"_blank\">published</a> scholarly articles on information technology  as Pezeshkians deputy with oversight of the countrys AI program suggests an increasing recognition of the importance of AI.</p><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/iran_ai_001_6bd6d1d62b.png\" alt=\"iran-ai-001.png\"><em><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Inauguration of Irans National Artificial Intelligence Organization in Tehran (Source: Mehr News)</em></p><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/iran_ai_002_dc5f600753.png\" alt=\"iran-ai-002.png\"><em><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Exterior of the National Artificial Intelligence Organization (Source: <a href=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/GN4RRv5iSHZNqmbT7\" target=\"_blank\">Google Maps</a>)</em></p><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/iran_ai_003_023523ac12.png\" alt=\"iran-ai-003.png\"><em><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Location of the National Artificial Intelligence Organization (Source: <a href=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/GN4RRv5iSHZNqmbT7\" target=\"_blank\">Google Maps</a>)</em></p><h2 id=\"laying-the-foundations-of-an-ai-ecosystem\">Laying the Foundations of an AI Ecosystem</h2><p>Insikt Group examined Iranian government statements, press releases, leadership speeches, academic journals, industry websites, and news media, all of which provide key insights into the development and deployment of AI in Iran. However, these sources often provide broad knowledge about Irans ambitions or intentions regarding AI and lack details on the specific models, technology, or deployment of AI in support of national security objectives. Western AI companies, such as OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft, as well as global cybersecurity and military experts, offer additional perspectives and analysis of Irans AI use cases.</p><h3 id=\"national-ai-strategy-development-and-challenges\">National AI Strategy Development and Challenges</h3><p>Following its leaders 2021 directive, the Islamic Republic has striven to develop and integrate AI through the establishment of various bureaucratic entities and industry initiatives. Irans progress in AI advancement is almost certainly limited by two factors: (1) its economic and commercial isolation and (2) its government control and oversight. After years of international sanctions and commercial isolation, Irans technological advancement, particularly in security-related industries such as defense, energy, and maritime shipping, depends on indigenous and domestically engineered capabilities.  Iran <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/iransource/iran-s-troubled-quest-for-food-self-sufficiency/\" target=\"_blank\">strives</a> for self-sufficiency in various sectors, including food and energy, and this concept of a resistance economy, which <a href=\"https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/khamenei-attempts-restore-optimism-and-normality-nowruz-speeches\" target=\"_blank\">underpins</a> Iranian strategic culture and economic development priorities, very likely shapes the development of Irans AI ecosystem. The Iranian government almost certainly <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/iranian-studies/article/artificial-intelligence-in-iran-national-narratives-and-material-realities/9D2C33F3F1BC459712651443F1D203FB\" target=\"_blank\">disseminates</a> the narrative that Iran is a competitor in an AI global race and seeks to prove its technological prowess. As a result of Irans national ambitions for AI, its development ecosystem is very likely government-driven, in partnership with private industry and academia. Iranian technological leaders very likely understand that foreign advances in AI computing power, including private technology companies, can both benefit and augment Irans own internal efforts and uses. This dynamic  a top-down national strategy and AI technical development framework that is supported rather than driven by Irans own private sector innovation  is likely to limit the potential of Irans AI advances.</p><p>Irans own private sector innovation is likely stifled by its economic isolation and its dependencies on government funding and direction. Iran claims that the governments expanded support to the tech sector resulted in a surge of Iranian venture capital firms, accelerators, and innovation centers between 2019 and 2020, as these firms provided localized solutions amid global supply chain disruption (after the US withdrew from the Iran nuclear agreement and re-imposed sanctions).  However, according to a 2022 United Nations <a href=\"https://www.undp.org/publications/mapping-existing-innovation-ecosystem-ir-iran\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> on Irans innovation landscape, sanctions significantly hampered Irans startup ecosystem and the domestic and foreign appetite for investments in Iranian technology startups after 2018 was reduced substantially. Irans challenges and limitations are reflected in several global indices that analyze and measure AI advances and technological innovation across countries. Stanford Universitys Global AI Vibrancy Tool, which <a href=\"https://hai-production.s3.amazonaws.com/files/global_ai_vibrancy_tool_08.27.24.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">defines</a> AI vibrancy as the level of activity, development, and impact of AI technologies within a country, does not include Iran in its analysis of 36 countries leading AI-related metrics. Iran is ranked 64th in the Global Innovation Index, which <a href=\"\" target=\"_blank\">reflects</a> a notable improvement over the last ten years. However, Irans institutional, regulatory, and business environments ranked 127th, 131st, and 128th, respectively, underscoring the systemic challenges to Irans innovation ecosystem. Oxford Insights <a href=\"https://www.wipo.int/web-publications/global-innovation-index-2024/assets/67729/2000%20Global%20Innovation%20Index%202024_WEB3lite.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">ranked</a> Iran 91st of 193 countries in the 2024 Government AI Readiness Index, a three-position improvement from its 2023 ranking, but scored lowest in the vision, adaptability, and maturity dimensions.</p><p>In 2022, Iran revealed fifteen policies shaping its AI development roadmap. A key theme underpinning these policies was the importance of national research centers, private industries, and universities working together to advance Irans AI development. Notably, two of the policies sought to support the private industrys use of academic plans and to increase private industrys trust in universities, likely suggesting a divide between Irans technical industry and its academic institutions. Another key theme of the policies was increasing foreign engagement and cooperation between Iranian and foreign academic centers. This likely reflects Irans interest in leveraging foreign partnerships, particularly with countries that are adversarial to the West, in the AI field.</p><p>In July 2023, a study from the Journal of Science &amp; Technology Policy found that the artificial intelligence ecosystem in [Iran] has not yet taken shape in the true sense and there is still no relative consensus among actors for dividing tasks and missions.&quot; Less than a year later, the same journal  which is affiliated with Irans National Science Policy Research Center  published a Nowruz 1403 (Persian new year, corresponding with March 2024) special edition entitled Generative Artificial Intelligence: Multiple Perspectives on Opportunities, Challenges, and Implications in Research, Practice, and Policymaking that examined the abundant ethical and legal opportunities and challenges of AI, specifically ChatGPTs practical, ethical, semantic, and policy challenges.&quot; The studys conclusion highlighted the lack of well-developed ethical guidelines and noted that it is vital that new rules be established to govern these instruments, and given their global nature, international coordination is also necessary to maximize their benefits. The 43 expert authors from various business and technological fields disagreed about whether ChatGPT should be restricted or legalized in Iran.</p><p>Irans bureaucratic challenges in the AI realm, including changes in presidential administrations and a plethora of organizational stakeholders with overlapping responsibilities, likely limit the countrys ability to implement an overarching strategy for its AI development. Tehrans policy toward AI is overseen by Irans Supreme Council of the Cultural Revolution (SCCR)  a strategic policy body that answers only to the Supreme Leader  whose approval in June 2024 was required to move forward with the National AI Organization, steering council, and the documents generalities. This approval involved review of the AI organizations statutes and 18,000 supporting documents to ensure the project was not tainted by Western influence. The SCCR established a specialized Commission for AI in September 2022 composed of officials from all armed forces branches, the General Staff of the Armed Forces, the Office of the Supreme Leader, the Ministry of Intelligence, and the Ministry of Higher Education. In January 2025, Pezeshkian noted the importance of AI development in a meeting with the SCCR, asserting that any delay or backwardness in the development of AI in Iran would be damaging and irreparable. Domestic critics of Irans AI policy have raised concerns about the unstable decisions, constant policy changes, and lack of a clear roadmap that has hampered the countrys AI program. For example, in December 2024, Afshin announced that the cabinet was drafting a charter for the National AI Organization that would focus on the organizations role in planning and overseeing AI activities; three months later, semi-official news agency Tasnim News suggested the possibility that the National AI Organization could be dissolved, raising a series of contradictions and unanswered ambiguity.  </p><h3 id=\"ai-budget\">AI Budget</h3><p>Documentation of Irans investment and funding of AI is opaque, but even with conflicting information, Irans lack of significant AI funding compared to its competitors will likely imperil its top-ten AI ambitions. The SCCR reportedly allocated a budget totaling 3.5 trillion Tomans (over 83 million dollars) in its approval; Irans initial operating budget for AI has also been reported as $50 million USD.  According to the Tehran Times, 50 trillion rials (some $100 million) has been allocated for the development of AI operators during Persian year 1403 (between March 2024 and March 2025). In January 2025, Irans National Development Fund  independent of the Iranian government budget  agreed to allocate $15.6 million USD to AI projects in universities and private research centers, while another $100 million USD will be provided in the form of loans. These funding numbers lag significantly behind the AI budgets of regional competitors like the United Arab Emirates (approximately $1.2 billion USD) and Saudi Arabia (approximately $2 billion USD). </p><h3 id=\"government-entities\">Government Entities</h3><p>Insikt Group identified a number of government entities that are involved in the direction, strategic planning, and national coordination for the development of Irans AI capabilities. The protracted process for the formulation of Irans national AI strategy document, which has <a href=\"https://ideaagency.net/irans-advancements-in-ai-collaboration-on-national-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\">involved</a> a cross-agency collaboration process with multiple stakeholders, likely reflects a bureaucratic competition for influence and ownership of AI leadership within the Iranian government. The division of power among various government elements has likely hampered Irans ability to form a cohesive AI strategy and development plan.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Organization</strong></td><td><strong>Role in AI Development</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Supreme Council of the Cultural Revolution (SCCR)</td><td><ul><li>Created following the 1979 Islamic Revolution to ensure Iran&rsquo;s higher education system adhered rigorously to Islamic Revolution ideals</li><li>Approves Iran&rsquo;s national AI documents and organization</li><li>Established a Commission for AI and Cyberspace among its &ldquo;specialized committees</li><li>Likely aims to preserve Iran&rsquo;s culture and religious ideals in the development of AI, given its original mandate</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Vice Presidency for Science, Technology and Knowledge-based Economy</td><td><ul><li>Established in 2006 with the SCCR&rsquo;s approval &ldquo;to support and strengthen the scientific and research activities of elites&rdquo; and to develop national strategic and prioritized technologies</li><li>Tasked by the Iranian president &ldquo;to interact with AI specialists in universities, research centers and Parliament&rdquo; to study &ldquo;different dimensions of AI,&rdquo; &ldquo;with the aim of adopting policies and formulating laws</li><li>Likely plays a critical role in implementing Khamenei&rsquo;s vision and directing resources for Iran&rsquo;s AI advancement, driving cooperation among technological experts on national AI-related projects and initiatives</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>National Artificial Intelligence Organization (or National Organization for AI)</td><td><ul><li>Under the supervision of the Iranian President</li><li>Launched in July 2024, after SCCR&rsquo;s approval of statutes and 18,000 supporting documents</li><li>Tasked with &ldquo;implementing a national AI strategy&rdquo; and &ldquo;to provide sufficient resources, with support from the National Development Fund, to create the necessary infrastructure&rdquo; and &ldquo;support private companies in developing advanced AI models and algorithms</li><li>Aims to &ldquo;plan and oversee AI activities rather than directly intervene</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Ministry of Information and Communications Technology (ICT)</td><td><ul><li>Considered to be the &ldquo;executive core of artificial intelligence&rdquo; in Iran</li><li>A subsidiary, the Information Technology Organization of Iran, is responsible for &ldquo;facilitating e-services delivery&rdquo; and &ldquo;to develop and maintain the country&rsquo;s national information exchange center&rdquo;</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>ICT Research Institute (Formerly ITRC)</td><td><ul><li>Established in 1970 at the University of Tehran</li><li>Serves as the main research arm for ICT nationwide, while &ldquo;customizing and channelizing advanced information technology at industry level</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Artificial Intelligence Innovation and Development Center</td><td><ul><li>Under the oversight of the ICT Research Institute</li><li>Involved in &ldquo;planning, executing the evaluating and providing quality assurance certification for AI products and services&rdquo;</li><li>Includes specialized &ldquo;laboratories&rdquo; for the development and evaluation of AI products and services, including machine vision and image processing, text and natural language processing, speech and audio processing, biometrics, data processing, and cognitive science</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>National Cyberspace Center</td><td><ul><li>Monitors and directs the activities of various organizations, including the Vice Presidency&rsquo;s efforts &ldquo;for employing innovative technologies in the virtual space, such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, quantum computing, and data science</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><p><em><strong>Table 1:</strong> Iranian entities involved in AI strategy (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><p>Irans military plays a key role in technological developments through civil-military cooperation, which very likely extends into the AI realm. Iranian armed forces, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), have <a href=\"https://cira.exovera.com/research-analysis/irgcs-involvement-in-science-technology-parks-blurs-line-between-civilian-military/\" target=\"_blank\">affiliated</a> universities and science and technology (S&amp;T) parks and run their own technology parks as incubators. For example, Imam Hossein University  affiliated with the IRGC  has a technology center and hosted The International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and the Future Civilization on January 29, 2025. Irans military branches from the Army and IRGCs ground, naval, and air forces each have their own research and development entity, <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-58649-1_19\" target=\"_blank\">referred</a> to as a Research Self-Sufficiency and Jihad Organization (RSSJO), that conducts specialized and tailored R&amp;D for the unique needs of their respective forces. These RSSJOs are likely involved in independent efforts in defense-related R&amp;D and in cooperation with academic institutions; they are likely integrating AI development into those efforts. Irans Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL) also likely has a key role in defense-related AI development, having signed partnership agreements with 80 universities and 800 industrial towns in Iran.</p><h3 id=\"government-initiatives\">Government Initiatives</h3><p>Announcements by the Vice Presidency for Science, Technology and Knowledge-based Economy regarding its AI development initiatives likely suggest Iran is working to develop a sovereign AI capability  meaning an Iranian national capability to <a href=\"https://aimagazine.com/articles/what-is-sovereign-ai-and-why-is-it-gaining-traction\" target=\"_blank\">produce</a> AI using its own infrastructure, data, workforce, and business networks through the development of foundation models trained on local datasets that reflect local language and culture. Hossein Afshin, Irans Vice President for Science, Technology and Knowledge-based Economy, hosted a meeting with the Technology Group from Tarbiat Modarres University on December 1, 2024, during which he reviewed the teams progress, requirements, and support mechanisms for its Project for Designing a Large Native Iranian Language Model. He subsequently announced on December 3, 2024, that a prototype of Irans national AI operating system, which was designed to host AI algorithms locally, was expected in six months. Iran intends to launch the countrys first GPU data center by 2025 and plans to establish its first AI park  to showcase the technological developments of the country and provide practical AI-related services to the people  within the next two years.</p><p>On March 15, 2025, Vice President Afshin unveiled Irans national AI platform and announced a phased rollout of the project, framing it as a strategic move in a global war of chips and algorithms. The platforms initial testing and optimization are planned for the first half of 2025, followed by limited access for technology experts and companies in the third quarter, a public beta release in September 2025, culminating with a public release in approximately March 2026. Over 100 Iranian professors and researchers collaborated on the project, which was developed in cooperation with Sharif University of Technology  an institution that is <a href=\"https://www.opensanctions.org/entities/NK-nxBVUwhmE8JFVPkiVzKVaS/\" target=\"_blank\">sanctioned</a> for its links to the IRGC and MODAFL related to military and ballistic missile technology development.  An expert developer and representative of Sharif University, Hossein Asadi, noted that the AI platform was developed using an open-source framework and specifically highlighted that it would be entirely independent, with no reliance on foreign APIs [application programming interfaces], ensuring the platforms services would continue without disruption even if the countrys internet were to be completely disconnected.</p><p>Iran almost certainly seeks to leverage domestic resources to support these development initiatives. On December 13, 2024, Afshin declared the governments intention to jumpstart domestic chip production for AI through the Sahand National Project (  ). The Sahand National Project is consistent with Irans focus on leveraging its own human and natural resources to deliver indigenous technological solutions and is likely a reaction to an anticipated increase in economic isolation under the US presidential administration of Donald Trump. The US government <a href=\"https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2025/01/13/fact-sheet-ensuring-u-s-security-and-economic-strength-in-the-age-of-artificial-intelligence/\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> export restrictions on January 13, 2025, which are designed to curtail the sale of chips with high-computational graphics processing unit (GPU) power for AI advanced development (such as Nvidias A100 and H100 chips) to sanctioned countries like Iran. </p><p>According to Iranian media, the projects aim is to manufacture nine-nines (99.9999999%) purity silicon wafers, the first step in setting up a domestic supply chain for microchips, with a view to open Irans first GPU data center by early 2025. While public information on the project remains limited, its reported location  in Sahand, East Azerbaijan province  would likely have been chosen for its proximity to <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sahand-industrial-group\" target=\"_blank\">Sahand Industrial Group</a> (SIG), Irans leading glass and silica producer, and the Sahand University of Technology, which has specialized laboratories in material and nanomaterial engineering. Using satellite imagery, Insikt Group identified a new two-million-square-foot facility under construction near an existing SIG silica manufacturing plant in Sahand, showing significant investment in the regions industrial capabilities.</p><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/iran_ai_004_ab2b738eab.png\" alt=\"iran-ai-004.png\"><em><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Satellite imagery of a two-million square foot facility between May 2020 and May 2024 near an SIG silica plant in Sahand, East Azerbaijan, Iran (Source: <a href=\"https://earth.google.com/web/@37.98555449,46.05734324,1318.43207051a,2331.38762272d,35y,356.98663711h,0t,0r/data=ChYqEAgBEgoyMDIwLTA1LTEzGAFCAggBMikKJwolCiExRjlFYTB2c1g5MUJONlFrSGlxZUlYTTZKckFvSEpWcGQgAToDCgEwQgIIAEoICJag4dgDEAE\" target=\"_blank\">Google Earth</a>)</em></p><p>Another government initiative announced on January 11, 2025, by Afshin aims to establish a hub for AI innovation in the oil and gas industries on Kish Island, Southern Iran, in association with the Persian Gulf Petrochemical Industries Company and the Kish Free Zone Organization. The location choice likely enables the Iranian government to unlock three benefits for the acceleration of AI development: the Kish Free Zones lax foreign investment and fiscal policies to encourage foreign direct investments (FDI); existing infrastructure, including an international airport and ports that can be leveraged for international transit; and lax entry visa requirements on Kish Island that <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Iran.html\" target=\"_blank\">enable</a> reputable Iranian academic institutions (such as Sharif University of Technology, which has an international campus in Kish) to attract foreign talent and investment.</p><p>Iran has announced several AI-enabled tools for the benefit of the Iranian government and society. Alongside his announcement of Irans domestic chip production project in December 2024, Afshin also declared that the Iranian government has prioritized the development of AI assistants available to government officials, developed in collaboration with universities with a team of over 70 expert professors. The AI assistants are reportedly expected to help government ministers to extract both laws and regulations and production-related issues from data and make suggestions in decision-making. In August 2024, Irans National Cyberspace Center announced the Arbaeen Artificial Intelligence Assistant (which references Arbaeen, a Shiite holy day, during which Shia Muslims <a href=\"https://www.newarab.com/features/explainer-what-arbaeen\" target=\"_blank\">make</a> a pilgrimage to Iraq) was a guide for pilgrims to access routes and processions, management of information for scheduling ceremonies and events, as well as the status of health and medical services, weather conditions, and even cultural and linguistic guidance online. In November 2024, Irans national religious headquarters, located at Qom Seminary, launched an indigenously developed platform that uses AI to answer questions and remove doubts on religious issues. Dubbed Deendaan, the platform was introduced by the seminarys National Center for Answering Religious Questions. Another entity in Qom, the Noor Computer Centre for Islamic Sciences Research, is seeking to <a href=\"https://archive.is/npvsM#selection-2349.43-2349.93\" target=\"_blank\">incorporate</a> AI in its use of religious texts and data to accelerate the Islamic studies of senior clergy and speed up their communication to the public. </p><h3 id=\"academia\">Academia</h3><p>Irans most globally recognized AI innovation, the Surena IV humanoid robot, was developed by Irans academic sector, underscoring the key role of universities and research institutes in Irans AI ecosystem. Created at the Center of Advanced Systems and Technologies (CAST) at the University of Tehran, the robots fourth generation uses the Robot Operating System for state monitoring, real time implementation of algorithms, and simultaneous running of several programs. The robot was <a href=\"https://www.asme.org/topics-resources/content/10-humanoid-robots-of-2020\" target=\"_blank\">listed</a> as one of the top ten humanoid robots in 2020, according to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. In addition to developing the Surena humanoid, CAST has a portfolio of projects related to various fields, including mechatronics, robotics, and intelligent systems inspired by nature, as well as aquatic inspired robots and those inspired by birds.</p><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/iran_ai_005_ab855d70a9.png\" alt=\"iran-ai-005.png\"><em><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Surena IV, developed at the University of Tehran (Source: <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/iran-surena-iv-humanoid-robot\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE</a>)</em></p><p>Leading Iranian universities in the field of AI <a href=\"https://edurank.org/cs/ai/ir/\" target=\"_blank\">include</a> the University of Tehran, Amirkabir University of Technology, and Iran University of Science and Technology, all located in Tehran. According to the state-run news outlet Tehran Times, over the last ten years, the most scientific productions in artificial intelligence have been associated with Tehran University, Tabriz University, and Amirkabir University of Technology. However, these universities likely remain low on global rankings for AI research; the University of Tehran, widely recognized as the best higher education institution in Iran, <a href=\"https://edurank.org/uni/university-of-tehran/rankings/\" target=\"_blank\">ranks</a> at number 201 globally for AI. Edurank data suggests that Irans top three universities are ahead or on par with their Russian peers (Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University, and the National Research University) but far behind China (Tsinghua University, Harbin Institute of Technology, and Shanghai Jiao Tong University) in terms of production (number of publications) and influence (number of citations). Iranian national investment in AI research is likely less than Russian investment, but its academic citation numbers are greater than Russias, likely reflecting that Irans AI academics maintain disproportionate influence in their field relative to their Russian counterparts.</p><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/iran_ai_006_8ad8b5bb07.png\" alt=\"iran-ai-006.png\"><em><strong>Figure 6:</strong> Top three universities in Iran, Russia, and China by papers and citations in the field of AI (Source: <a href=\"https://edurank.org/cs/ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Edurank</a>)</em></p><p>In the absence of a vibrant private AI sector, the Iranian government is likely reliant on academics specialized in AI for government projects at the expense of cutting-edge research. Iranian media boasted that 70 expert professors were working to design an AI platform for government ministers. Sharif University of Technology, ranked fourth in Iran in AI, is likely a key partner for government projects, such as Irans national AI platform. The government demand for expertise likely represents a misallocation of research talent towards state-mandated engineering projects, which likely impedes Irans research potential. However, Iranian academic centers may also be exploring open-source AI development, which likely encourages innovation. For example, in November 2024, Amirkabir University, in collaboration with AI developer Part AI, announced the development of the most comprehensive and powerful evaluation system for Persian language models, known as <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/spaces/PartAI/open-persian-llm-leaderboard\" target=\"_blank\">Open Persian LLM Leaderboard</a>, which includes over 40,000 samples and tracks the performance of 25 major open-source models at Persian-language tasks. Part AI has also published six open-source models, including Persian finetunes of Metas Llama 3.1 and Googles BERT models.</p><p>A search of recent and upcoming conferences related to AI suggests Irans academic sector is exploring AI applications in several sectors, including medical sciences, telecommunications, electrical engineering, education, mining, and industry. In 2024, Iran held a number of inaugural national conferences on specific topics, very likely suggesting the concept of how AI can benefit specific industrial sectors is still nascent in Iran. For example, in October 2024, Iran held the first national conference on AI in education and learning; in May 2024, Iran held its first national conference on AI and the Internet of Things; in April 2024, it held its second national conference on Digital Transformation and Intelligent Systems.</p><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/iran_ai_007_cc46a37180.png\" alt=\"iran-ai-007.png\"><em><strong>Figure 7:</strong> Poster of international AI conference which notes the cooperation with prestigious universities and scientific centers of Iran and the world (Source: Imam Hossein University)</em></p><p>Iranian universities are very likely driving international engagement by hosting conferences on AI. A review of international AI-related conferences held in Iran in 2024 and planned for 2025 highlights a wide range of foreign academic participants, including academics from Austria, Australia, Canada, China, France, Italy, Iraq, Malaysia, Russia, Spain, Vietnam, and the United Kingdom.   Iranian academic output on AI likely benefits from strong ties with Iranian-American researchers and collaboration with US academic institutions. An Iranian study of domestic output of AI research between 1978 and 2022 found that US researchers were the most frequent international co-authors on Iranian AI research. However, Iranian academic AI research likely remains of limited international influence. 19.9% of Iranian AI papers during this period received no citations, with the majority receiving between one and five citations.</p><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/iran_ai_008_803597413b.png\" alt=\"iran-ai-008.png\"><em><strong>Figure 8:</strong> Network map of countries co-authoring with Iranian AI researchers between 1978 and 2022, based on the Scopus database (Source: Shahed University)</em></p><h3 id=\"private-technology-companies\">Private Technology Companies</h3><p>Irans private sector currently faces significant challenges in the face of international sanctions and lack of global competitiveness, including the inability to retain top talent, the absence of foundational AI model companies, low capital expenditures on AI by existing major players in the technology sphere, and a nascent venture capital (VC) ecosystem.</p><p>Iran almost certainly <a href=\"https://www.mei.edu/publications/escalating-emigration-and-drought-irans-it-industry\" target=\"_blank\">suffers</a> from a significant talent outflow of skilled workers in technology and AI. According to a 2021 report by the Iran Migration Observatory, 50% of Iranians <a href=\"https://www.mei.edu/publications/escalating-emigration-and-drought-irans-it-industry\" target=\"_blank\">involved</a> in startup communities and 44% of graduates were planning on emigrating, citing unpredictable internet regulations, censorship, and lack of wage competitiveness as direct factors. In December 2024, Irans Vice President Afshin announced a new regulation offering monthly grants of approximately 15 million Tomans ($3,564 USD) for PhD students to encourage research and scientific activities, stressing the importance of preventing talent migration.</p><p>Despite talent shortages, Indian data provider TraxCN has <a href=\"https://tracxn.com/d/artificial-intelligence/ai-startups-in-iran/__aWyQstgrq_MtBd_T7d2d9-itkASMubg8G_HbLca8W_8/companies\" target=\"_blank\">identified</a> at least 85 companies in Iran advertised as operating in the field of AI, with a majority focusing on developing AI enterprise applications and tools for healthcare, agriculture, and finance. Several companies provide chatbot services and LLMs, including Persian-language chatbots; however, it remains unclear whether they are developing proprietary models rather than deploying existing open-source models. Additionally, TraxCN considers that seventeen (20%) of these companies are currently deadpooled (no longer in business) and 60 (80.5%) remain unfunded, indicating that despite government efforts to incentivize AI startups, the average Iranian AI startup is doomed to fail in raising funds or operating sustainably. Iranian AI website Hooshio published a list of 29 Iranian AI companies, highlighting the Parth AI Research Center as one of the top five companies in the Middle East with more than 150 specialists in AI. The company claims to have Irans biggest AI research center with a department for machine vision, natural language processing (NLP), speech processing, and data analysis, as well as an AI college. </p><p>Irans private tech sector is likely trying to financially motivate AI innovation and engage with Irans developer community.

Notably, the hackathons rules <a href=\"https://archive.ph/c9swn\" target=\"_blank\">banned</a> participants from using Western AI models (listing models from Western companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere), likely intending for participants to focus on using open-source models for hackathon entries.</p><p>Unlike their Western and Chinese counterparts, Iranian VC funds are likely limited in their ability to fund and support a domestic AI startup ecosystem to fulfill national security and economic priorities, with startups <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/outlook/fmo/capital-raising/traditional-capital-raising/venture-capital/iran\" target=\"_blank\">forecasted</a> to raise $28.13 million USD in capital in 2025 across all sectors. Irans Pardis Technology Park (PTP), dubbed Iran Silicon Valley and operating under the auspices of the Vice Presidency for Science, Technology, and Knowledge-based Economy, is the most significant center for developing startups and knowledge-based companies and commercialization of technology and innovations in Iran. PTP, which is part of the Iran International Innovation District, boasts 25.5 million EUR of foreign investments in its companies over the last five years and is also supported by the Iran National Innovation Fund, Irans version of a venture capital and private equity firm. </p><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/iran_ai_009_300bca3ba4.png\" alt=\"iran-ai-009.png\"><em><strong>Figure 9:</strong> Forecasted capital raised by startups for 2025 in China, Russia, and Iran (Source: Statista <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/outlook/fmo/capital-raising/traditional-capital-raising/venture-capital/china#:~:text=The%20country%20in%20China%20is,US%2449.17bn%20in%202025.\" target=\"_\">1<a/>, <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/outlook/fmo/capital-raising/traditional-capital-raising/venture-capital/russia#:~:text=Russia%20is%20projected%20to%20see,US%240.27bn%20in%202025.\" target=\"_\">2</a>, <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/outlook/fmo/capital-raising/traditional-capital-raising/venture-capital/iran\" target=\"_\">3</a>)</em></p><h3 id=\"open-source\">Open Source</h3><p>Open-source communities <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-opportunities-action-plan-government-response/ai-opportunities-action-plan-government-response\" target=\"_blank\">play</a> an important role in the development of AI capabilities, as open-source AI models can <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190226132342id_/http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/71bc/34f9611e020e5d673b03af354d45b022018d.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">lower</a> research and development costs, present opportunities for technology transfers, and reduce dependency on models developed by foreign companies.

ODISTC was set up to serve as a foundation for increasing scientific, technological and innovation communications with other countries, as well as securing a significant share of the regional and global trade of knowledge-based products. Among the services offered in ODISTCs Technological Exchange Office is bilateral scientific and technology cooperation in the form of joint research funds with the [sic] countries like China and Russia. More details pertaining to Irans cooperation with China and Russia are discussed below. </p><h4 id=\"china\">China</h4><p>Irans technological cooperation with China is very likely a key strategic interest for Irans AI development. In 2021, Irans Strategic Council on Foreign Relations promoted building relationships between Iranian and Chinese technology companies and higher education institutions. AI was specifically mentioned as part of the Iran-China 25-year Comprehensive Partnership, officially signed in March 2021.

In November 2024, Iranian company Bayan Rayan  the countrys only server producer  received an award at the 26th annual China Hi-Tech Fair (CHTF) 2024.

Since the Supreme Leader issued a directive in 2021, Iran has endeavored to develop a national strategy and oversight mechanism for AI and foster a technological ecosystem to drive domestic research and development. However, two key factors  Tehrans global economic isolation, and its deeply entrenched system of government control and oversight  have almost certainly hindered Irans national AI development. \nIn 2024, as Tehrans support for its proxies Hamas and Hezbollah against Israel embroiled Iran in unprecedented regional conflicts and ongoing cyberwarfare, new insights emerged about how Iran has implemented AI technologies in its national security apparatus. Iran has used AI to bolster its capabilities in four main areas: cyberattacks, influence operations, military and intelligence systems, and domestic repression. These priorities will continue to propel Irans development and implementation of AI, almost certainly posing an increasing threat to Irans Western and regional adversaries. In cyberspace, AI will likely augment Iranian threat actors spearphishing and social engineering tradecraft, while AIs implementation in Irans drone and missile arsenal is likely to pose the greatest physical threat from emerging technology.\nIrans approach to AI will likely mirror its broader strategic ambitions  to be a regional power and assert its national sovereignty  by building and implementing advanced technological capabilities. Iranian government initiatives are likely to be the driving force behind Irans AI development priorities, particularly given the absence of a flourishing AI private sector. While Tehran will promote its own technological prowess and indigenous AI development, the Iranian government is likely to leverage its relationship with China and Russia in various security realms to bolster its AI technology capabilities. Private industry, particularly companies in the AI or technology resources industry, should closely monitor end users of their models or materials to ensure Iranian threat actors are not using their products or acquiring controlled technologies. Similarly, governments should invest in identifying and preventing the Iranian defense industry from acquiring AI technologies that enhance its military capabilities. \nKey Findings\n\nIran has articulated lofty goals for its AI advancement and seeks to compete in the global AI race, but it is almost certainly hindered by two factors: First, its economic and commercial isolation limits its access to technological resources and human capital. Second, its top-down government control and oversight stifles private innovation in AI.\nTo augment its own indigenous research and development (R&D) capabilities in AI, Iran will likely leverage its bilateral and regional relationships for technology engagement with China, Russia, and other non-Western countries.\nAmidst unprecedented domestic upheaval and regional conflict over the last three years, Iran very likely views AI as a key force multiplier for its national security and defense and has sought to integrate AI into its cyber and influence operations, military systems, and domestic surveillance infrastructure.\nIt is very likely that Iranian threat actors will increasingly use generative AI and large language models (LLMs) to enhance their influence and cyber operations, increasing risk to adversarial governments, as well as their critical infrastructure, technology companies, and other security-related industries. \nIran has very likely endeavored to implement AI in its military defense systems and publicly touts the capability, though its operational uses of the technologies remain unproven.\nIn the domestic sphere, Iran has very likely increased its efforts to deploy AI for morality enforcement and opposition monitoring, to enhance its control over Iranian society, particularly after the Woman Life Freedom protest movement.\nCompanies and governments should maintain vigilance in cybersecurity practices to reduce vulnerabilities to AI-enabled cyber and influence operations and limit Irans access to AI resources and expertise that could increase Tehrans threat to regional security.\n\nIrans AI Ambitions\nAt the highest level of its leadership, Iran has recognized and sought to develop an overarching national focus on AI (   in Persian). In November 2021, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei called AI an important and futuristic issue that will play a role in the future administration of the world, and urged Iran to become a top ten country in the field of AI. In August 2024, Khamenei urged Iran to master and develop the deep and diverse layers of AI technology, warning that a global oversight body (similar to the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]) might regulate its use in the future. Khameneis stated ambition for Irans AI prominence initiated a flurry of government-led activity to develop and implement a national strategy and technological ecosystem to align with the Supreme Leaders intent. Iran subsequently began creating a national AI roadmap that evaluated the strategic documents of 23 countries in the field of AI and developed a plan to realize Khameneis goal by 2032. The goals of the roadmap document were to achieve 80 percent of research to meet the needs of the country, use of 45 percent of AI in industries, $8 billion investment in AI, and a 12 percent share of AI in the GDP.\" The document contained fourteen macro policies, 47 micro-policies, 39 general actions, and 155 projects and activities. According to the roadmap, by the Persian year 1410 (starting March 2031), Iran would need to train 600,000 experts in the AI field to accomplish these objectives.\nIrans presidency  specifically, the Vice Presidency for Science, Technology and Knowledge-based Economy  oversees the Iranian governments effort to establish and implement an AI strategy. On December 3, 2023, President Ebrahim Raisi issued an executive order to establish the National Steering Committee and the National Artificial Intelligence (AI) Center, which would focus on creating integrated AI processing and data service providers, aligning with the countrys needs, and implementing large-scale AI projects.\"  He appointed Reshad Hosseini as Secretary for the Development of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Headquarters, a role intended to develop a technology development roadmap and to make maximum use of all the internal capacity of the innovation ecosystem.\" Irans AI Strategic Council was to be formed of ministers and heads of relevant institutions to implement, coordinate, and monitor a National AI Document.\nAfter Raisis death in May 2024, the administration of President Masoud Pezeshkian has continued to emphasize Irans AI strategy. The National AI Organization (or the National Organization for AI) was inaugurated in July 2024 in Tehran. Insikt Group identified the organizations physical location in north central Tehran, on Molla Sadra Street (Figures 1-3). During Pezeshkians endorsement ceremony and National Government Week meeting in August 2024, Khamenei advised the new administration that the good initiative begun under deceased President Raisi unfortunately remains unfinished, but advised that the National AI Organization, under the direct supervision of the President, should continue Raisis progress. On October 15, 2024, Irans Information Technology Council issued a decision that within two months, the National Organization of Artificial Intelligence should present to the working group the requirements for creating, developing, maintaining and publishing data and information in the hyper scale database of artificial intelligence.\" \nPezeshkian appointed Hossein Afshin, a professor of mechanical engineering at Sharif University of Technology, as his Vice President for Science, Technology, and Knowledge-based Economy, who also serves as the secretary and vice president of the National AI Organization and serves as the face of AI development within Iran. Pezeshkian also assigned his First Vice President, Dr. Mohammad Reza Aref, as chairman of the National AI Organization and its strategic council. Arefs appointment as First Vice President prompted criticism for his political obscurity, likely reflecting Pezeshkians choice for the position was based on his scientific prowess and technical acuity rather than his accomplishments as a reformist politician. The prominent role of Aref  who holds two advanced degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University, has been a professor at two prestigious Iranian universities, and has published scholarly articles on information technology  as Pezeshkians deputy with oversight of the countrys AI program suggests an increasing recognition of the importance of AI.\nFigure 1: Inauguration of Irans National Artificial Intelligence Organization in Tehran (Source: Mehr News)\nFigure 2: Exterior of the National Artificial Intelligence Organization (Source: Google Maps)\nFigure 3: Location of the National Artificial Intelligence Organization (Source: Google Maps)\nLaying the Foundations of an AI Ecosystem\nInsikt Group examined Iranian government statements, press releases, leadership speeches, academic journals, industry websites, and news media, all of which provide key insights into the development and deployment of AI in Iran. However, these sources often provide broad knowledge about Irans ambitions or intentions regarding AI and lack details on the specific models, technology, or deployment of AI in support of national security objectives. Western AI companies, such as OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft, as well as global cybersecurity and military experts, offer additional perspectives and analysis of Irans AI use cases.\nNational AI Strategy Development and Challenges\nFollowing its leaders 2021 directive, the Islamic Republic has striven to develop and integrate AI through the establishment of various bureaucratic entities and industry initiatives. Irans progress in AI advancement is almost certainly limited by two factors: (1) its economic and commercial isolation and (2) its government control and oversight. After years of international sanctions and commercial isolation, Irans technological advancement, particularly in security-related industries such as defense, energy, and maritime shipping, depends on indigenous and domestically engineered capabilities.  Iran strives for self-sufficiency in various sectors, including food and energy, and this concept of a resistance economy, which underpins Iranian strategic culture and economic development priorities, very likely shapes the development of Irans AI ecosystem. The Iranian government almost certainly disseminates the narrative that Iran is a competitor in an AI global race and seeks to prove its technological prowess. As a result of Irans national ambitions for AI, its development ecosystem is very likely government-driven, in partnership with private industry and academia. Iranian technological leaders very likely understand that foreign advances in AI computing power, including private technology companies, can both benefit and augment Irans own internal efforts and uses. This dynamic  a top-down national strategy and AI technical development framework that is supported rather than driven by Irans own private sector innovation  is likely to limit the potential of Irans AI advances.\nIrans own private sector innovation is likely stifled by its economic isolation and its dependencies on government funding and direction. Iran claims that the governments expanded support to the tech sector resulted in a surge of Iranian venture capital firms, accelerators, and innovation centers between 2019 and 2020, as these firms provided localized solutions amid global supply chain disruption (after the US withdrew from the Iran nuclear agreement and re-imposed sanctions).  However, according to a 2022 United Nations report on Irans innovation landscape, sanctions significantly hampered Irans startup ecosystem and the domestic and foreign appetite for investments in Iranian technology startups after 2018 was reduced substantially. Irans challenges and limitations are reflected in several global indices that analyze and measure AI advances and technological innovation across countries. Stanford Universitys Global AI Vibrancy Tool, which defines AI vibrancy as the level of activity, development, and impact of AI technologies within a country, does not include Iran in its analysis of 36 countries leading AI-related metrics. Iran is ranked 64th in the Global Innovation Index, which reflects a notable improvement over the last ten years. However, Irans institutional, regulatory, and business environments ranked 127th, 131st, and 128th, respectively, underscoring the systemic challenges to Irans innovation ecosystem. Oxford Insights ranked Iran 91st of 193 countries in the 2024 Government AI Readiness Index, a three-position improvement from its 2023 ranking, but scored lowest in the vision, adaptability, and maturity dimensions.\nIn 2022, Iran revealed fifteen policies shaping its AI development roadmap. A key theme underpinning these policies was the importance of national research centers, private industries, and universities working together to advance Irans AI development. Notably, two of the policies sought to support the private industrys use of academic plans and to increase private industrys trust in universities, likely suggesting a divide between Irans technical industry and its academic institutions. Another key theme of the policies was increasing foreign engagement and cooperation between Iranian and foreign academic centers. This likely reflects Irans interest in leveraging foreign partnerships, particularly with countries that are adversarial to the West, in the AI field.\nIn July 2023, a study from the Journal of Science & Technology Policy found that the artificial intelligence ecosystem in [Iran] has not yet taken shape in the true sense and there is still no relative consensus among actors for dividing tasks and missions.\" Less than a year later, the same journal  which is affiliated with Irans National Science Policy Research Center  published a Nowruz 1403 (Persian new year, corresponding with March 2024) special edition entitled Generative Artificial Intelligence: Multiple Perspectives on Opportunities, Challenges, and Implications in Research, Practice, and Policymaking that examined the abundant ethical and legal opportunities and challenges of AI, specifically ChatGPTs practical, ethical, semantic, and policy challenges.\" The studys conclusion highlighted the lack of well-developed ethical guidelines and noted that it is vital that new rules be established to govern these instruments, and given their global nature, international coordination is also necessary to maximize their benefits. The 43 expert authors from various business and technological fields disagreed about whether ChatGPT should be restricted or legalized in Iran.\nIrans bureaucratic challenges in the AI realm, including changes in presidential administrations and a plethora of organizational stakeholders with overlapping responsibilities, likely limit the countrys ability to implement an overarching strategy for its AI development. Tehrans policy toward AI is overseen by Irans Supreme Council of the Cultural Revolution (SCCR)  a strategic policy body that answers only to the Supreme Leader  whose approval in June 2024 was required to move forward with the National AI Organization, steering council, and the documents generalities. This approval involved review of the AI organizations statutes and 18,000 supporting documents to ensure the project was not tainted by Western influence. The SCCR established a specialized Commission for AI in September 2022 composed of officials from all armed forces branches, the General Staff of the Armed Forces, the Office of the Supreme Leader, the Ministry of Intelligence, and the Ministry of Higher Education. In January 2025, Pezeshkian noted the importance of AI development in a meeting with the SCCR, asserting that any delay or backwardness in the development of AI in Iran would be damaging and irreparable. Domestic critics of Irans AI policy have raised concerns about the unstable decisions, constant policy changes, and lack of a clear roadmap that has hampered the countrys AI program. For example, in December 2024, Afshin announced that the cabinet was drafting a charter for the National AI Organization that would focus on the organizations role in planning and overseeing AI activities; three months later, semi-official news agency Tasnim News suggested the possibility that the National AI Organization could be dissolved, raising a series of contradictions and unanswered ambiguity.  \nAI Budget\nDocumentation of Irans investment and funding of AI is opaque, but even with conflicting information, Irans lack of significant AI funding compared to its competitors will likely imperil its top-ten AI ambitions. The SCCR reportedly allocated a budget totaling 3.5 trillion Tomans (over 83 million dollars) in its approval; Irans initial operating budget for AI has also been reported as $50 million USD.  According to the Tehran Times, 50 trillion rials (some $100 million) has been allocated for the development of AI operators during Persian year 1403 (between March 2024 and March 2025). In January 2025, Irans National Development Fund  independent of the Iranian government budget  agreed to allocate $15.6 million USD to AI projects in universities and private research centers, while another $100 million USD will be provided in the form of loans. These funding numbers lag significantly behind the AI budgets of regional competitors like the United Arab Emirates (approximately $1.2 billion USD) and Saudi Arabia (approximately $2 billion USD). \nGovernment Entities\nInsikt Group identified a number of government entities that are involved in the direction, strategic planning, and national coordination for the development of Irans AI capabilities. The protracted process for the formulation of Irans national AI strategy document, which has involved a cross-agency collaboration process with multiple stakeholders, likely reflects a bureaucratic competition for influence and ownership of AI leadership within the Iranian government. The division of power among various government elements has likely hampered Irans ability to form a cohesive AI strategy and development plan.\n\nOrganizationRole in AI Development\nSupreme Council of the Cultural Revolution (SCCR)\nCreated following the 1979 Islamic Revolution to ensure Iran’s higher education system adhered rigorously to Islamic Revolution ideals\nApproves Iran’s national AI documents and organization\nEstablished a Commission for AI and Cyberspace among its “specialized committees\nLikely aims to preserve Iran’s culture and religious ideals in the development of AI, given its original mandate\n\nVice Presidency for Science, Technology and Knowledge-based Economy\nEstablished in 2006 with the SCCR’s approval “to support and strengthen the scientific and research activities of elites” and to develop national strategic and prioritized technologies\nTasked by the Iranian president “to interact with AI specialists in universities, research centers and Parliament” to study “different dimensions of AI,” “with the aim of adopting policies and formulating laws\nLikely plays a critical role in implementing Khamenei’s vision and directing resources for Iran’s AI advancement, driving cooperation among technological experts on national AI-related projects and initiatives\n\nNational Artificial Intelligence Organization (or National Organization for AI)\nUnder the supervision of the Iranian President\nLaunched in July 2024, after SCCR’s approval of statutes and 18,000 supporting documents\nTasked with “implementing a national AI strategy” and “to provide sufficient resources, with support from the National Development Fund, to create the necessary infrastructure” and “support private companies in developing advanced AI models and algorithms\nAims to “plan and oversee AI activities rather than directly intervene\n\nMinistry of Information and Communications Technology (ICT)\nConsidered to be the “executive core of artificial intelligence” in Iran\nA subsidiary, the Information Technology Organization of Iran, is responsible for “facilitating e-services delivery” and “to develop and maintain the country’s national information exchange center”\n\nICT Research Institute (Formerly ITRC)\nEstablished in 1970 at the University of Tehran\nServes as the main research arm for ICT nationwide, while “customizing and channelizing advanced information technology at industry level\n\nArtificial Intelligence Innovation and Development Center\nUnder the oversight of the ICT Research Institute\nInvolved in “planning, executing the evaluating and providing quality assurance certification for AI products and services”\nIncludes specialized “laboratories” for the development and evaluation of AI products and services, including machine vision and image processing, text and natural language processing, speech and audio processing, biometrics, data processing, and cognitive science\n\nNational Cyberspace Center\nMonitors and directs the activities of various organizations, including the Vice Presidency’s efforts “for employing innovative technologies in the virtual space, such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, quantum computing, and data science\n\n\nTable 1: Iranian entities involved in AI strategy (Source: Recorded Future)\nIrans military plays a key role in technological developments through civil-military cooperation, which very likely extends into the AI realm. Iranian armed forces, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), have affiliated universities and science and technology (S&T) parks and run their own technology parks as incubators. For example, Imam Hossein University  affiliated with the IRGC  has a technology center and hosted The International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and the Future Civilization on January 29, 2025. Irans military branches from the Army and IRGCs ground, naval, and air forces each have their own research and development entity, referred to as a Research Self-Sufficiency and Jihad Organization (RSSJO), that conducts specialized and tailored R&D for the unique needs of their respective forces. These RSSJOs are likely involved in independent efforts in defense-related R&D and in cooperation with academic institutions; they are likely integrating AI development into those efforts. Irans Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL) also likely has a key role in defense-related AI development, having signed partnership agreements with 80 universities and 800 industrial towns in Iran.\nGovernment Initiatives\nAnnouncements by the Vice Presidency for Science, Technology and Knowledge-based Economy regarding its AI development initiatives likely suggest Iran is working to develop a sovereign AI capability  meaning an Iranian national capability to produce AI using its own infrastructure, data, workforce, and business networks through the development of foundation models trained on local datasets that reflect local language and culture. Hossein Afshin, Irans Vice President for Science, Technology and Knowledge-based Economy, hosted a meeting with the Technology Group from Tarbiat Modarres University on December 1, 2024, during which he reviewed the teams progress, requirements, and support mechanisms for its Project for Designing a Large Native Iranian Language Model. He subsequently announced on December 3, 2024, that a prototype of Irans national AI operating system, which was designed to host AI algorithms locally, was expected in six months. Iran intends to launch the countrys first GPU data center by 2025 and plans to establish its first AI park  to showcase the technological developments of the country and provide practical AI-related services to the people  within the next two years.\nOn March 15, 2025, Vice President Afshin unveiled Irans national AI platform and announced a phased rollout of the project, framing it as a strategic move in a global war of chips and algorithms. The platforms initial testing and optimization are planned for the first half of 2025, followed by limited access for technology experts and companies in the third quarter, a public beta release in September 2025, culminating with a public release in approximately March 2026. Over 100 Iranian professors and researchers collaborated on the project, which was developed in cooperation with Sharif University of Technology  an institution that is sanctioned for its links to the IRGC and MODAFL related to military and ballistic missile technology development.  An expert developer and representative of Sharif University, Hossein Asadi, noted that the AI platform was developed using an open-source framework and specifically highlighted that it would be entirely independent, with no reliance on foreign APIs [application programming interfaces], ensuring the platforms services would continue without disruption even if the countrys internet were to be completely disconnected.\nIran almost certainly seeks to leverage domestic resources to support these development initiatives. On December 13, 2024, Afshin declared the governments intention to jumpstart domestic chip production for AI through the Sahand National Project (  ). The Sahand National Project is consistent with Irans focus on leveraging its own human and natural resources to deliver indigenous technological solutions and is likely a reaction to an anticipated increase in economic isolation under the US presidential administration of Donald Trump. The US government announced export restrictions on January 13, 2025, which are designed to curtail the sale of chips with high-computational graphics processing unit (GPU) power for AI advanced development (such as Nvidias A100 and H100 chips) to sanctioned countries like Iran. \nAccording to Iranian media, the projects aim is to manufacture nine-nines (99.9999999%) purity silicon wafers, the first step in setting up a domestic supply chain for microchips, with a view to open Irans first GPU data center by early 2025. While public information on the project remains limited, its reported location  in Sahand, East Azerbaijan province  would likely have been chosen for its proximity to Sahand Industrial Group (SIG), Irans leading glass and silica producer, and the Sahand University of Technology, which has specialized laboratories in material and nanomaterial engineering. Using satellite imagery, Insikt Group identified a new two-million-square-foot facility under construction near an existing SIG silica manufacturing plant in Sahand, showing significant investment in the regions industrial capabilities.\nFigure 4: Satellite imagery of a two-million square foot facility between May 2020 and May 2024 near an SIG silica plant in Sahand, East Azerbaijan, Iran (Source: Google Earth)\nAnother government initiative announced on January 11, 2025, by Afshin aims to establish a hub for AI innovation in the oil and gas industries on Kish Island, Southern Iran, in association with the Persian Gulf Petrochemical Industries Company and the Kish Free Zone Organization. The location choice likely enables the Iranian government to unlock three benefits for the acceleration of AI development: the Kish Free Zones lax foreign investment and fiscal policies to encourage foreign direct investments (FDI); existing infrastructure, including an international airport and ports that can be leveraged for international transit; and lax entry visa requirements on Kish Island that enable reputable Iranian academic institutions (such as Sharif University of Technology, which has an international campus in Kish) to attract foreign talent and investment.\nIran has announced several AI-enabled tools for the benefit of the Iranian government and society. Alongside his announcement of Irans domestic chip production project in December 2024, Afshin also declared that the Iranian government has prioritized the development of AI assistants available to government officials, developed in collaboration with universities with a team of over 70 expert professors. The AI assistants are reportedly expected to help government ministers to extract both laws and regulations and production-related issues from data and make suggestions in decision-making. In August 2024, Irans National Cyberspace Center announced the Arbaeen Artificial Intelligence Assistant (which references Arbaeen, a Shiite holy day, during which Shia Muslims make a pilgrimage to Iraq) was a guide for pilgrims to access routes and processions, management of information for scheduling ceremonies and events, as well as the status of health and medical services, weather conditions, and even cultural and linguistic guidance online. In November 2024, Irans national religious headquarters, located at Qom Seminary, launched an indigenously developed platform that uses AI to answer questions and remove doubts on religious issues. Dubbed Deendaan, the platform was introduced by the seminarys National Center for Answering Religious Questions. Another entity in Qom, the Noor Computer Centre for Islamic Sciences Research, is seeking to incorporate AI in its use of religious texts and data to accelerate the Islamic studies of senior clergy and speed up their communication to the public. \nAcademia\nIrans most globally recognized AI innovation, the Surena IV humanoid robot, was developed by Irans academic sector, underscoring the key role of universities and research institutes in Irans AI ecosystem. Created at the Center of Advanced Systems and Technologies (CAST) at the University of Tehran, the robots fourth generation uses the Robot Operating System for state monitoring, real time implementation of algorithms, and simultaneous running of several programs. The robot was listed as one of the top ten humanoid robots in 2020, according to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. In addition to developing the Surena humanoid, CAST has a portfolio of projects related to various fields, including mechatronics, robotics, and intelligent systems inspired by nature, as well as aquatic inspired robots and those inspired by birds.\nFigure 5: Surena IV, developed at the University of Tehran (Source: IEEE)\nLeading Iranian universities in the field of AI include the University of Tehran, Amirkabir University of Technology, and Iran University of Science and Technology, all located in Tehran. According to the state-run news outlet Tehran Times, over the last ten years, the most scientific productions in artificial intelligence have been associated with Tehran University, Tabriz University, and Amirkabir University of Technology. However, these universities likely remain low on global rankings for AI research; the University of Tehran, widely recognized as the best higher education institution in Iran, ranks at number 201 globally for AI. Edurank data suggests that Irans top three universities are ahead or on par with their Russian peers (Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University, and the National Research University) but far behind China (Tsinghua University, Harbin Institute of Technology, and Shanghai Jiao Tong University) in terms of production (number of publications) and influence (number of citations). Iranian national investment in AI research is likely less than Russian investment, but its academic citation numbers are greater than Russias, likely reflecting that Irans AI academics maintain disproportionate influence in their field relative to their Russian counterparts.\nFigure 6: Top three universities in Iran, Russia, and China by papers and citations in the field of AI (Source: Edurank)\nIn the absence of a vibrant private AI sector, the Iranian government is likely reliant on academics specialized in AI for government projects at the expense of cutting-edge research. Iranian media boasted that 70 expert professors were working to design an AI platform for government ministers. Sharif University of Technology, ranked fourth in Iran in AI, is likely a key partner for government projects, such as Irans national AI platform. The government demand for expertise likely represents a misallocation of research talent towards state-mandated engineering projects, which likely impedes Irans research potential. However, Iranian academic centers may also be exploring open-source AI development, which likely encourages innovation. For example, in November 2024, Amirkabir University, in collaboration with AI developer Part AI, announced the development of the most comprehensive and powerful evaluation system for Persian language models, known as Open Persian LLM Leaderboard, which includes over 40,000 samples and tracks the performance of 25 major open-source models at Persian-language tasks. Part AI has also published six open-source models, including Persian finetunes of Metas Llama 3.1 and Googles BERT models.\nA search of recent and upcoming conferences related to AI suggests Irans academic sector is exploring AI applications in several sectors, including medical sciences, telecommunications, electrical engineering, education, mining, and industry. In 2024, Iran held a number of inaugural national conferences on specific topics, very likely suggesting the concept of how AI can benefit specific industrial sectors is still nascent in Iran. For example, in October 2024, Iran held the first national conference on AI in education and learning; in May 2024, Iran held its first national conference on AI and the Internet of Things; in April 2024, it held its second national conference on Digital Transformation and Intelligent Systems.\nFigure 7: Poster of international AI conference which notes the cooperation with prestigious universities and scientific centers of Iran and the world (Source: Imam Hossein University)\nIranian universities are very likely driving international engagement by hosting conferences on AI. A review of international AI-related conferences held in Iran in 2024 and planned for 2025 highlights a wide range of foreign academic participants, including academics from Austria, Australia, Canada, China, France, Italy, Iraq, Malaysia, Russia, Spain, Vietnam, and the United Kingdom.   Iranian academic output on AI likely benefits from strong ties with Iranian-American researchers and collaboration with US academic institutions. An Iranian study of domestic output of AI research between 1978 and 2022 found that US researchers were the most frequent international co-authors on Iranian AI research. However, Iranian academic AI research likely remains of limited international influence. 19.9% of Iranian AI papers during this period received no citations, with the majority receiving between one and five citations.\nFigure 8: Network map of countries co-authoring with Iranian AI researchers between 1978 and 2022, based on the Scopus database (Source: Shahed University)\nPrivate Technology Companies\nIrans private sector currently faces significant challenges in the face of international sanctions and lack of global competitiveness, including the inability to retain top talent, the absence of foundational AI model companies, low capital expenditures on AI by existing major players in the technology sphere, and a nascent venture capital (VC) ecosystem.\nIran almost certainly suffers from a significant talent outflow of skilled workers in technology and AI. According to a 2021 report by the Iran Migration Observatory, 50% of Iranians involved in startup communities and 44% of graduates were planning on emigrating, citing unpredictable internet regulations, censorship, and lack of wage competitiveness as direct factors. In December 2024, Irans Vice President Afshin announced a new regulation offering monthly grants of approximately 15 million Tomans ($3,564 USD) for PhD students to encourage research and scientific activities, stressing the importance of preventing talent migration.\nDespite talent shortages, Indian data provider TraxCN has identified at least 85 companies in Iran advertised as operating in the field of AI, with a majority focusing on developing AI enterprise applications and tools for healthcare, agriculture, and finance. Several companies provide chatbot services and LLMs, including Persian-language chatbots; however, it remains unclear whether they are developing proprietary models rather than deploying existing open-source models. Additionally, TraxCN considers that seventeen (20%) of these companies are currently deadpooled (no longer in business) and 60 (80.5%) remain unfunded, indicating that despite government efforts to incentivize AI startups, the average Iranian AI startup is doomed to fail in raising funds or operating sustainably. Iranian AI website Hooshio published a list of 29 Iranian AI companies, highlighting the Parth AI Research Center as one of the top five companies in the Middle East with more than 150 specialists in AI. The company claims to have Irans biggest AI research center with a department for machine vision, natural language processing (NLP), speech processing, and data analysis, as well as an AI college. \nIrans private tech sector is likely trying to financially motivate AI innovation and engage with Irans developer community. Digikala, Irans biggest technology and e-commerce company (valued at approximately $500 million USD as of August 2024), hosted an AI hackathon in March 2024 with a first-place prize of 60 million Tomans (approximately $14,258 USD). Notably, the hackathons rules banned participants from using Western AI models (listing models from Western companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere), likely intending for participants to focus on using open-source models for hackathon entries.\nUnlike their Western and Chinese counterparts, Iranian VC funds are likely limited in their ability to fund and support a domestic AI startup ecosystem to fulfill national security and economic priorities, with startups forecasted to raise $28.13 million USD in capital in 2025 across all sectors. Irans Pardis Technology Park (PTP), dubbed Iran Silicon Valley and operating under the auspices of the Vice Presidency for Science, Technology, and Knowledge-based Economy, is the most significant center for developing startups and knowledge-based companies and commercialization of technology and innovations in Iran. PTP, which is part of the Iran International Innovation District, boasts 25.5 million EUR of foreign investments in its companies over the last five years and is also supported by the Iran National Innovation Fund, Irans version of a venture capital and private equity firm. \nFigure 9: Forecasted capital raised by startups for 2025 in China, Russia, and Iran (Source: Statista 1, 2, 3)\nOpen Source\nOpen-source communities play an important role in the development of AI capabilities, as open-source AI models can lower research and development costs, present opportunities for technology transfers, and reduce dependency on models developed by foreign companies. Irans open-source community almost certainly lags behind in terms of developing home-grown AI models, finetunes, and datasets. Data from open-source AI model platform HuggingFace shows that Farsi-language models (including multilingual models from US AI companies) are outnumbered by open-source models with language capabilities for Mandarin, Korean, or Russian. Sanctions are almost certainly throttling the emergence of a strong Iranian open-source software community. GitHub, a major platform for hosting open-source code, was blocked in Iran in 2019 and only resumed operations in 2021 after securing a special license from the US Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) board.\nFigure 10: Number of models published on HuggingFace with language capabilities in Farsi, Russian, Korean, and Chinese (Source: HuggingFace)\nIrans biggest open-source AI contributor, measured by the number of Farsi-language AI models published on Hugging Face, is likely Hezar AI, followed by Persian NLP and Hooshvare Research Lab. US technology companies Facebook and Google are also among the top ten publishers of Farsi-language models on HuggingFace.\nForeign Cooperation\nIrans Organization for Development of International Science and Technology Cooperation (ODISTC) very likely plays a critical role in facilitating the exchange of ideas, goods, and services related to AI. ODISTC was set up to serve as a foundation for increasing scientific, technological and innovation communications with other countries, as well as securing a significant share of the regional and global trade of knowledge-based products. Among the services offered in ODISTCs Technological Exchange Office is bilateral scientific and technology cooperation in the form of joint research funds with the [sic] countries like China and Russia. More details pertaining to Irans cooperation with China and Russia are discussed below. \nChina\nIrans technological cooperation with China is very likely a key strategic interest for Irans AI development. In 2021, Irans Strategic Council on Foreign Relations promoted building relationships between Iranian and Chinese technology companies and higher education institutions. AI was specifically mentioned as part of the Iran-China 25-year Comprehensive Partnership, officially signed in March 2021. A leaked version of the plan, sourced from Irans Ministry of Foreign Affairs and reported by the Wilson Center, proposed the cooperation involved introducing joint pilot projects in the fields of smart technology and artificial intelligence. Second to the sale of its oil to China, Iran likely views AI development and technological exchanges as a top priority for its bilateral relations with China, and Chinas challenge to US dominance in AI development aligns with Tehrans goal to oppose US hegemony.\nChinas use of AI for surveillance and monitoring has very likely been the most robust area for Irans foreign AI engagement, enabling Chinese companies to expand their export of specific technologies that facilitate Iranian domestic repression. However, academic and research collaboration is very likely another key area in which Irans technology sector is benefitting from the relationship with China. In November 2024, Iranian company Bayan Rayan  the countrys only server producer  received an award at the 26th annual China Hi-Tech Fair (CHTF) 2024. In 2022, an official at Irans Islamic Azad University touted the Iran-China agreement as a golden opportunity to boost cooperation in AI and benefit from Chinese advancement in the AI field, noting that Iran had 3,000 Iranian students studying in China.\nRussia\nThe anti-West strategic alignment and commercial isolation that Iran and Russia both share, particularly as a result of Russias war with Ukraine, has resulted in deeper cooperation in many security-related fields. Despite the increased cooperation in several spheres, specific details on the extent of the current Iran-Russia collaboration on AI R&D are limited. In January 2025, Tehran and Moscow signed a comprehensive twenty-year strategic partnership agreement that reinforced areas of ongoing cooperation in the technical sphere, including information and communication technologies, digital development, and higher education. While the text of the agreement does not specifically mention AI, Irans Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated the agreement provides a platform for sharing knowledge and collaboration in fields such as nanotechnology, aerospace, artificial intelligence, and medical sciences and expands cooperation at the government and academic levels.\nLeading up to the 2025 comprehensive agreement, a flurry of Iran-Russia cooperation documents and engagements have promoted cooperation on AI. In March 2024, the two countries signed a Memorandum of Understanding to cooperate on ethics in AI, exchanging experiences in the implementation of the ethical principles of AI. The agreement specified that the Russian Commission on Ethics in AI would provide training for Irans AI and Robotics Development headquarters. In November 2019, Russia and Iran signed a Memorandum of Understanding on cooperation to support twenty joint research plans in fifteen scientific fields, including, among others, information technology, computer systems, and AI.\nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.","enclosure":{"url":"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/format_webp/irans_ai_ambitions_balancing_economic_isolation_national_security_imperatives_151fba814d.png","length":"0","type":"image/png"},"content":"Explore how Iran is leveraging AI for cyberwarfare, influence ops, military tech, and domestic surveillance.

It provides the insights to answer these questions for DDoS and any other cyber risk that may create one or more of the five risk impacts.\nSmart Data Means Smart Decisions\nGood decisions need good data. Recorded Future tracks thousands of DDoS attacks every day, giving you a clear picture of whos getting hit and how often. Pulling data from the Recorded Future API gives analysts useful analytics, like IP addresses targeted by attackers.\nWith this data, security teams can:\n\nSpot trends and predict who might be next\nAutomate defenses and make faster decisions\nBetter manage risk, knowing exactly when and how to invest\n\nDDoS target list courtesy of Recorded Future\nWho's Being Targeted?\nLaunching DDoS attacks isnt technically difficult. Someone with basic internet know-how can do it. But some attackers put more effort into it, building armies of infected devices known as botnets. One tool frequently used by pro-Russian hackers, called DDoSia, attacks different targets daily. By tracking whos getting hit most, businesses can better prepare their defenses.\nFor example, Ukraine currently faces heavy attacks due to geopolitical tensions. But finance and transportation companies in Europe are also frequent targets, suggesting broader threats.\nTen months of DDoSia targets by industry, courtesy of Recorded Future\nThinking Bigger than Just Your Own Network\nWhen CISOs arent considering crafting better risk management narratives for executive consumption, they are contemplating improving operational resilience. Denial of service attacks fall squarely in this category. The revolving questions dont stop with an organizations local network perimeter (if such a thing even exists anymore) but extend to partners, suppliers, and wider internet infrastructure (e.g., DNS and CDN providers).\nMore than ever, daily business and geopolitical events create a cascading effect of cyber impacts. DDoS is always a possibility. Recent attacks against X (Twitters hip rebrand) are a good reminder.\nKey Decisions for Stronger DDoS Defense\nThe decisions that underpin DDoS defense and response correspond to organizational size, mission, footprint, regulatory compliance mandates, and resources. Here are some practical actions to consider:\n\nPartnering with your internet provider for fast response\nUsing scrubbing centers to filter attack traffic\nImplementing challenge-response tests like CAPTCHAs\nDeploying cloud protections like AWS Shield\nUtilizing web application firewalls (WAF)\nOptimizing network setups (like load balancers and distributed data centers)\nFiltering traffic using firewalls and intrusion systems\nRelying on content delivery networks (CDNs)\nUsing Anycast routing to protect DNS services\n\nAnalytic contemplation courtesy of Gemini\nEveryones a Target\nIts tempting to think your business won't face a DDoS attack, especially if it's small or non-political. The reality? Anyone online can become a target for extortion or political agendas. That's why proactive intelligence is so valuableit helps security teams know when threats are getting closer and when its time to upgrade defenses.\nAs the frequency of DDoS attacks increases around certain industries or regions, it's essential to reassess and strengthen your own security controls accordingly. The closer these threats get, the more your organization should test their resilience. Said differently, as DDoS attack proximity moves closer to an organization, the operational disruption risk may, in parallel, need to move north on the resilience axis.\nRisk Graph courtesy of ChatGPT\nStaying One Step Ahead\nDDoS attacks aren't going away, but they don't have to be a nightmare, either. Threat intelligence provides the clear insights needed to prepare and respond effectively. By using analytics wisely, organizations can invest smartly, build stronger defenses, and keep their operations running smoothly. When attacks creep closersay, spiking in your sector or geographysecond-order risks (like operational disruption) loom larger. Thats your cue to prioritize resilience, whether a CDN subscription or ISP speed-dial.","enclosure":{"url":"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/500fc1fa_fdd8_4120_88e7_6fdd5297e25e_1024x1024_c45b87a67a.webp","length":"0","type":"image/webp"},"content":"Discover how integrating threat intelligence into your cybersecurity strategy can lead to smarter, more efficient security investments.

At an average loss rate of 5.28% due to typosquatting according to research from University of Illinois, more efficient typosquat takedowns with Recorded Future would help them recover over 50,000 website visits each month  and an expected $2,602 monthly value.\n\"We have improved brand protection by at least 100%. We can identify risks and patterns in infancy stages, and we've automated brand scanning to eliminate hours of manual work. As we automate more coverage, we have saved hundreds of labor hours per quarter and improved efficiency,\" reports Joe Azzouggagh, Manager of Trust and Safety at ruby.\nCyber Insurance Considerations\nAs cyber attacks have become more prevalent, cyber insurance has evolved from a nice-to-have to a business necessity. However, premiums can be substantial, particularly for organizations that face significant risk.\nBased on observable market data and the average 2024 cost of a breach being $4.88 million, a typical billion-dollar company likely pays a yearly premium of $207,400, or $35-50,000 per million of coverage.\nRecorded Future customers report average monthly premium savings of $2,497approximately $30,000 annually. One customer, Cummins, achieved an impressive 32% year-over-year reduction in cyber insurance premiums after implementing Recorded Future's threat intelligence platform.\nOperational Disruption and Downtime\nService disruptions resulting from cyber incidents carry dual consequences: immediate revenue losses and lasting reputational damage. Reducing operational risk has become a priority for organizations of all sizes. When systems go offline due to ransomware or distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, every minute of downtime translates to financial impact.\nOur customers report that threat intelligence from Recorded Future helps minimize downtime, which for a billion-dollar organization translates to an average revenue value of approximately $19,025 per monthor nearly $230,000 annually. This calculation doesn't even account for the additional benefit of avoiding reputational damage that inevitably accompanies service disruptions.\nRecorded Future allows us to shift our mindset from being more reactive in nature to being more proactive and responsive to threats that went unnoticed in the past. This, in turn, has facilitated the development of new processes that have enhanced the overall security posture of the business,\" explains a Lead Cyber Defense Engineer at a major food and staples retailing company.\nFraud Prevention\nPayment fraud, transaction fraud, and billing schemes represent significant financial threats to businesses across industries. Through comprehensive threat intelligence, organizations can identify and mitigate these risks before they materialize into actual losses.\nRecorded Futures threat intelligence helps customers reduce fraud losses. A billion-dollar business that loses $500,000 annually to payment fraud losses would recover over $6,812 per month through improved threat intelligence with Recorded Future. Outside of the payments themselves, fraud loss mitigation also contributes financially by strengthening the integrity and trustworthiness of your business.\nAs one customer, a Senior Information Security Analyst at Jefferson Bank, noted: \"We use Recorded Future's dark web intelligence to proactively stop attacks, reset weak passwords, or prevent bank card fraud. This has a potential savings of $1,000-2,000 depending on the customer or situation.\"\nAll Together: The ROI of Business and Brand Risk Reduction with Recorded Future\nAcross all risk reduction areas, customers can save approximately $31,000 monthlyor $371,000 yearly.\nThis substantial return breaks down into several key components:\n\n$2,602 monthly from brand reputation protection\n$2,497 monthly from reduced cyber insurance premiums\n$19,025 monthly from downtime avoidance/increased uptime\n$6,812 monthly from fraud loss prevention\n\nTogether, these savings represent a 209.4% ROI on business risk reduction alone. When combined with the productivity improvements that threat intelligence enables (an additional 141.9% ROI), Recorded Future customers achieve a total of 351.3% ROI annually.\nImplementing a Proactive Cybersecurity Strategy\nTo realize the full business impact of threat intelligence, organizations should follow a structured approach to implementation:\n1. Define Business-Centric Security Priorities\nBegin by identifying your organization's \"crown jewels\"the critical assets, data, and operations that would cause significant harm if compromised. This is a fundamental principle of business risk management. Work with business leadership to understand what matters most to the organization's success and prioritize security efforts accordingly.\n2. Assess Threats in Business Context\nNot all vulnerabilities will be exploited, and not all threats pose an immediate risk to your specific organization. Use threat intelligence to focus first on responding to the threats that present actual risk to your people, assets, and business objectives.\n3. Leverage Automation to Increase Efficiency\nWith proper automation, security teams can dramatically reduce manual effort while improving response times. By automating routine tasks like alert enrichment and correlation, analysts can focus on strategic threat hunting and proactive security initiatives.\n4. Measure and Communicate Business Impact\nTrack and report on security metrics that matter to business leaders, such as:\n\nReduced cyber insurance premiums\nAvoided fraud losses\nIncreased uptime\nAccelerated response times\nBrand protection efforts\n\n5. Mature Your Program Over Time\nAs your threat intelligence program matures, continuously refine your approach to address evolving business needs and emerging threats. This might include expanding monitoring to new digital channels, deepening integration with business systems, or enhancing threat hunting capabilities.\nConclusion: Protecting Business Continuity Through Cyber Risk Reduction\nThe data is clear: By implementing comprehensive threat intelligence from Recorded Future, organizations can not only prevent security incidents but also demonstrate tangible ROI through business risk reduction.\nWith 57% of customers reporting that Recorded Future has significantly reduced their organization's overall cyber risk, the platform has proven its ability to deliver meaningful business impact. From protecting brand reputation and reducing cyber insurance premiums to preventing downtime and fraud losses, threat intelligence serves as a foundational element of business resilience.\nIn today's threat landscape, organizations that understand the business value of cybersecurity will maintain competitive advantage through stronger customer trust, operational resilience, and financial stability. By using threat intelligence to reduce risk strategically, security leaders can position their teams as essential contributors to business success rather than cost centers.\nThe message for business and security leaders is clear: investing in comprehensive threat intelligence isn't just a security requirementit's a business imperative with measurable returns.\nDiscover the Full Impact\nWant to learn more about how threat intelligence can protect your brand, reduce costs, and strengthen your business?

To make their challenges worse, teams often struggle with a lack of visibility, alert fatigue, limited resources and manual processes.\nThreat intelligence has emerged as a critical solution to these challenges, providing the context and actionable insights needed to prioritize effectively and respond proactively. Rather than adding to the noise, threat intelligence cuts through it, enabling security teams to work more efficiently, focusing on what matters and responding to it quickly. \nTo understand how customers of Recorded Future leverage threat intelligence to act more efficiently, we partnered with third-party research firm UserEvidence to collect quantitative ROI data and qualitative feedback to create our newly published report: How Recorded Future Drives ROI for Cybersecurity Teams. \nThe report reveals that by automating manual workflows, streamlining investigations, and enabling teams to focus on what matters most, Recorded Future customers are reporting time savings of over 100 hours per weektranslating to approximately $290,237 in annual productivity gains for the average organization. In this blog post, we explore the reports findings and what our customers have to say about improving efficiency. \nThe Growing Need for Cybersecurity Efficiency\nSecurity teams across industries are feeling the strain of increasing responsibilities with limited resources. This imbalance often results in:\n\nBurnout among team members tasked with manual, repetitive processes\nOperational inefficiencies that slow response times\nDifficulty prioritizing among a constant stream of alerts\nChallenges in demonstrating value to organizational leadership\n\nThese challenges create a significant productivity gap that affects not just the security team, but the entire organization's resilience against cyber threats.\n\"Threat intelligence will always improve your visibility. The important part is to do it without overburdening your team. How can we add new threat intelligence use cases without creating a whole load of extra work and alerts to deal with?\" explains Jason Steer, CISO at Recorded Future.\nMeasuring the ROI of Recorded Future's Efficiency Gains\nRecent research conducted by UserEvidence paints a compelling picture of how Recorded Future transforms security operations. In a comprehensive survey of security professionals using the platform, the data revealed remarkable efficiency gains realized by teams, for example:\n\nTeams save an average of 11 hours weekly on alert triage, investigation, and response\nThreat analysis, hunting, and reporting time reduced by 11 hours weekly\nBrand abuse mitigation efforts streamlined by 8 hours per week\nSpending 7 hours less per week on vendor and supplier evaluation processes\n\nWhen translated to financial impact, these productivity improvements add up to approximately $290,237 in annual savings for the average organization implementing Recorded Future. Later in this article, well break down the full picture.\nAs one Senior SOC analyst and Threat Intelligence Analyst at an Air Freight & Logistics company reported: \"We automated 70% of manual workflows with Recorded Future, cutting investigation times by 50%. This led to a 40% increase in threat detection efficiency and a 30% reduction in response times, enhancing our overall security posture.\"\nValentin Vanlaeys, Threat Intelligence Lead at Proximus Ada, shared similar results: \"Thanks to Recorded Future's valuable and actionable data, we cut our intelligence hunting, reporting, and analysis by 80%.\"\nHow Recorded Future Transforms Security Operations\nCommon Challenges Security Teams Face in Productivity\nBefore: Manual Processes Amidst High Urgency\nWithout Recorded Future's automated intelligence capabilities, security teams shoulder the burden of time-consuming manual workflows that may look something like this:\n\nFinding relevant data sources across open-source intelligence feeds, blogs, news outlets, social media, and forums\nCollecting unstructured and complex data from these sources\nSifting through the data to separate signal from noise\nAnalyzing the information to identify potential threats\nCompiling and distributing reports\n\nThese processes  along with manual alert triage, investigation, and response  arent just frustratingly manual for team members. They also delay or slow down organizations response times. \nSecurity teams are inundated with alerts, some of which are noise and some of which are relevant and urgent. If they dont have actionable threat intelligence, they cant efficiently gain an understanding of the priority or criticality of each. And when it comes to addressing a security threat, time is of the essence. \nAfter: Actionable Intelligence and Automation with Recorded Future\nRecorded Future helps teams efficiently capture, compile, and analyze threat data, turning it into actionable intelligence that teams would otherwise need to triage, investigate, and respond to manually. This frees the security team to focus their energy on responding to high-priority threats and hunting new ones. Rather than struggling to address everything that seems important, they can think strategically about protecting their organization. \nWith the Recorded Future Intelligence Platform, teams can shift from reactive to proactive security postures:\n\nIntelligence-driven automation across security workflows accelerates identification, investigation, and prioritization of threats\nStreamlined workflows reduce investigation time by providing immediate context\nResource optimization allows skilled analysts to focus on strategic initiatives rather than routine tasks\n\nAs one Information Security Specialist at an Industrial Conglomerates Company noted: \"We use Recorded Future's risk lists to block malicious IPs with a risk score of 65 or higher. As a result, we automatically make an average of approximately 5 million blocks per day, resulting in a time savings of about 40 hours per month for our team.\"\nJack Edens, IT Security Analyst at Dupaco Credit Union, adds: \"Recorded Future was a game-changer for us, transforming how our team managed threats and stayed proactive. With their platform, we automated repetitive reporting tasks, which allowed us to move key resources onto critical issues, tightening our focus on real threats. This shift didn't just streamline our workflows; it gave us back nearly 50% in efficiency  significant when you're dealing with a constant flow of new data.\"\nReal-World Productivity Improvements: By the Numbers\nHow Threat Intelligence Increases Productivity and Efficiency\nRecorded Future customers achieve a more proactive, productive, and mature threat intelligence program, saving hundreds of thousands of dollars in productivity along the way. \nHere are the activities where they save time and money and improve their processes:\n  \n    \nActivity/AreaWeekly Time Savings\n    \nAlert triage, investigation, & response11 hrs\n    \nThreat analysis, hunting, & reporting11 hrs\n    \nBrand abuse mitigation8 hrs\n    \nVendor evaluation7 hrs\n    \nDigital footprint analysis8 hrs\n    \nThreat landscape analysis10 hrs\n    \nSenior analyst efficiency50 hrs\n  \n\nPerhaps most significant is the impact on senior analyst efficiency.

While many key 2023 trends persisted  such as Cobalt Strike dominating offensive security tools (OSTs), AsyncRAT and QuasarRAT leading among remote access trojans (RATs), China and the United States (US) being the top hosting locations, and law enforcement actions having often only temporary impact  Insikt Group identified several emerging trends in 2024.</p><p>Notably, malware-as-a-service (MaaS) infostealers, led by LummaC2, grew in prevalence, likely driven by law enforcement actions against competitor infostealers and rapid innovation by LummaC2. Additionally, Android remained the primary target for mobile malware, with Hook leading. While Latrodectus dominated droppers and loaders despite law enforcement disruptions in the loader ecosystem, traffic distribution systems (TDSs) continued to enhance cybercrime efficiency, as seen with TAG-124, and the abuse of content delivery networks (CDNs) like Cloudflare surged. In regards to state-sponsored groups, China notably increased its use of relay networks such as ArcSilt, while Russia continued its abuse of a wide range of <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/threat-actors-leverage-internet-services-to-enhance-data-theft-and-weaken-security-defenses\" target=\"_blank\">legitimate internet services (LIS)</a>.</p><p>Defenders should leverage this report&#39;s insights to strengthen security controls by prioritizing top malware and infrastructure techniques, and thereby enhance network monitoring and deploy relevant detections like YARA, Sigma, and Snort. This should be complemented by investments in tracking evolving malicious infrastructure dynamics, conducting threat simulations to test defenses, and effectively monitoring the broader threat landscape. Regarding LIS, defenders must balance blocking, flagging, or allowing high-risk services based on their assessed criticality and risk level.</p><p>As malicious infrastructure evolves and detection improves, Insikt Group expects existing trends to persist in 2025, driven by continuous threat actor innovation rather than drastic shifts. For example, the &quot;as-a-service&quot; ecosystem will likely expand, and threat actors will increasingly rely on legitimate tools, services, and CDNs to evade detection. Furthermore, with growing mobile reliance, Insikt Group expects mobile-based threats to continue to rise. Relay networks, primarily used by Chinese state-sponsored groups up until now, may see broader adoption by cybercriminals and other state-sponsored groups. Lastly, law enforcement actions are expected to have a greater impact due to enhanced international cooperation and accrued expertise in large-scale cybercrime takedowns.</p><h2 id=\"key-findings\">Key Findings</h2><ul><li>MaaS infostealers led in infections in 2024, with LummaC2 dominating command-and-control (C2) servers as continuous innovation and law enforcement actions against rivals like RedLine Stealer reshaped the cybercrime ecosystem.</li><li>AsyncRAT and Quasar RAT remained the top remote access tools (RATs), while MaaS-based malware like DcRAT continued widespread use.</li><li>The US (North America), Brazil (South America), Angola (Africa), France (Europe), India (Asia), and Australia (Oceania) recorded the highest number of victims in their respective regions based on Recorded Future Network Intelligence, with AsyncRAT emerging as the most prevalent malware in most cases. Other significant threats included QuasarRAT and Cobalt Strike.</li><li>Android remained the primary target for mobile malware, with nine of the top ten families focusing on it, alongside the rise of mercenary spyware and potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) like stalkerware.</li><li>Cobalt Strike accounted for two-thirds of offensive security tool command-and-control (C2) servers, with jQuery as the most popular malleable profile and cs2modrewrite targeting the most victim countries. Cobalt Strike is followed by Metasploit, with detections of Sliver and Brute Ratel C4 rising significantly.</li><li>Mozi Botnet was the largest tracked botnet in 2024 based on the number of identified bots, while older botnets remained active, being primarily used for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, as well as credential theft and localized attacks, as seen with Fenix Botnet.</li><li>Latrodectus dominated all droppers and loaders in 2024, accounting for 33% of detections, likely driven by law enforcement disruptions in the loader ecosystem, while most top families emerged post-2021, indicating shorter lifespans.</li><li>TDS continued to play a crucial role in cybercrime by improving efficiency, targeting, and profitability while evading detection, exemplified by TAG-124, which served a broad user base, including ransomware groups like Rhysida.</li><li>The US and China dominated malicious hosting, while bulletproof hosting providers like Stark Industries played a growing role in cybercrime infrastructure.</li><li>Chinese state-sponsored groups expanded their use of anonymization networks in 2024 to target entities worldwide, enabling them to blend with legitimate traffic and complicate victim identification, while RedDelta used Cloudflare to proxy C2 traffic and geo-fence malicious files.</li><li>Russian state-sponsored groups increasingly relied on legitimate services like Ngrok, Cloudflare, and Telegram to evade detection, with BlueDelta shifting to Ngrok after takedown efforts and BlueAlpha using Cloudflare Tunnels to stage GammaDrop malware.</li></ul><h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2><p>Insikt Group proactively identifies and monitors infrastructure associated with hundreds of malware families, threat actors, and other artifacts, including phishing kits, scanners, and relay networks. By automatically validating malicious infrastructure through various proprietary methods on a daily basis, Insikt Group provides accurate risk representation, enabling Recorded Future customers to enhance their detection and defense capabilities.</p><p>Building on Insikt Group&#39;s annual adversary infrastructure reports from <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/2022-adversary-infrastructure-report\" target=\"_blank\">2022</a> and <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2024-1209.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2023</a>, the 2024 Malicious Infrastructure Report provides a concise, data-based overview of malicious infrastructure observed throughout 2024. This year, it specifically emphasizes the synergy among passive infrastructure detection, higher-tier infrastructure insights powered by Recorded Future Network Intelligence, and victim identification. Overall, this report is for anyone interested in malicious infrastructure, offering a high-level overview of its current state as well as summaries of key findings to inform decision-making and provide a broad perspective in this highly dynamic environment.</p><p>Recognizing the challenge of categorizing malware types in a mutually exclusive manner due to their overlapping functionalities, this report establishes a set of malware categories to facilitate analysis, as detailed in <strong>Appendix A</strong>, with brief definitions for each. Notably, certain malware categories, such as crypters, have been intentionally excluded due to the usual absence of network artifacts.</p><p>Beyond examining malicious infrastructure through the lens of malware categories, Insikt Group also monitors it by type, with each type assigned a distinct risk scoring within the Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud. This differentiation reflects varying levels of severity  for instance, network traffic to or from a C2 server in a corporate network may indicate higher risk compared to a management panel, as it typically implies active malicious activity. The infrastructure types defined by Insikt Group are detailed in <strong>Appendix B</strong>.</p><h2 id=\"2024-malicious-infrastructure-insights-by-the-numbers\">2024 Malicious Infrastructure Insights by the Numbers</h2><p>Proactively identifying malicious infrastructure is a complex task shaped by various factors. In addition to the vast volume of data, each malware family, version, or infrastructure linked to specific threat actors often employs entirely unique setups. Detection becomes even more challenging due to factors such as hosting behind CDNs like Cloudflare, the use of high or random ports, reliance on <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/threat-actors-leverage-internet-services-to-enhance-data-theft-and-weaken-security-defenses\" target=\"_blank\">legitimate internet services</a> such as Discord or Telegram, or the exploitation of compromised infrastructure.</p><p>These setups also evolve continuously, demanding that Insikt Group constantly innovate and refine its tracking methodologies. Considering all these factors, this report examines malicious infrastructure across multiple categories, including infostealers, backdoors and RATs, mobile malware, OSTs, botnets, droppers and loaders, phishing kits, web shells, and ransomware.</p><p>Overall, in 2024, there has been a significant rise in identified malicious infrastructure, driven by an evolving threat landscape and advancements in detection methodologies by Insikt Group. For instance, the number of unique, validated C2 servers doubled from 2023 to 2024, while unique, validated management panels saw a 69% increase over the same period.</p><p>In addition, using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified victims in approximately 200 countries worldwide in 2024 based on victim IP address geolocation. Countries in <strong>Figure 1</strong> were categorized into five groups based on the number of unique victims detected, with those showing high exposure being geographically dispersed worldwide. Notably, accurately measuring malware impact across countries is challenging due to variations in population size, digital footprint, analytical biases (for example, the types of malware tracked), internet infrastructure (such as proxies), and the geographical hosting choices of victim organizations.</p><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/Fig_1_86418b387b.png\" alt=\"Malware impact by country\"><em><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Malware impact by country based on Recorded Future Network Intelligence (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><p><strong>Figure 2</strong> shows the distribution of victims by country across different continents. In North America, the US is the most targeted country, accounting for around 87% of unique victims in the region despite making up only about half of its population. The high victim count in the US is likely driven by factors such as its large population, extensive digital footprint, widespread English use (exploited in phishing campaigns), and economics, while also being influenced by the country&#39;s role as a global infrastructure hub, providing hosting and digital services to organizations worldwide. Most victims are linked to AsyncRAT, followed by SolarMarker RAT and QuasarRAT (see <strong>Table 1</strong>). Notably, unlike AsyncRAT and QuasarRAT, SolarMarker RAT is <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/exploring-the-depths-of-solarmarkers-multi-tiered-infrastructure\" target=\"_blank\">believed</a> to be operated by a single threat actor and has previously been observed predominantly targeting the US.</p><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/Fig_2_529f459d62.png\" alt=\"victim by country\"><em><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Shares of unique victim by country and continent (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><p>In South America, Brazil recorded the highest number of unique victims, accounting for 86% of the regions total, while also only making up around half of the continents population. Previously <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/angelicamarideoliveira/2023/09/27/brazil-is-the-worlds-second-most-vulnerable-country-to-cyberattacks/\" target=\"_blank\">identified</a> as one of the countries most vulnerable to cyberattacks, Brazil has long been a hotspot for both global and local cyber threats, <a href=\"https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2024-04-10-world-first-cybercrime-index-ranks-countries-cybercrime-threat-level\" target=\"_blank\">ranking</a> high in cybercrime activity, with groups like Grandoreiro operating almost exclusively within its borders. In 2024, QuasarRAT infections were the most prevalent among Brazilian victims, followed by infections linked to AsyncRAT and SectopRAT.</p><p>In Africa, Angola recorded the highest number of unique victims, followed by Ghana, South Africa, the Republic of the Congo, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Notably, in two of the five most targeted African countries, PlugX, a malware linked to multiple Chinese state-sponsored groups, ranked among the most prevalent malware.</p><p>In Europe, France had the highest number of unique victims, followed by Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Poland. AsyncRAT was the most prevalent malware across all five countries, with Cobalt Strike ranking second in three of them. The distribution of victims in these top five countries closely aligns with their population sizes. Notably, in the Netherlands, GobRAT  a backdoor targeting Linux routers with malware written in Go  ranked among the top three malware families.</p><p>In Asia, India recorded the highest number of unique victims, followed by China, Indonesia, Thailand, and Hong Kong. Approximately 73% of all victims in these countries were linked to AsyncRAT, QuasarRAT, and Cobalt Strike infections. Notably, Brute Ratel C4 ranked among the top three malware in Hong Kong, highlighting its growing significance.</p><p>In Oceania, Australia accounted for 87% of all unique victims despite making up only 60% of the region&#39;s population. AsyncRAT was the most prevalent malware, linked to over half of Australia&#39;s victims, while in New Zealand, 67% of victims were associated with AsyncRAT infections.</p><p><strong>Table 1</strong>

additional infrastructure types such as staging servers, and integrating data sources like Recorded Future Network Intelligence, enhancing threat detection, higher-tier infrastructure insights, and victimology analysis. While many key 2023 trends persisted  such as Cobalt Strike dominating offensive security tools (OSTs), AsyncRAT and QuasarRAT leading among remote access trojans (RATs), China and the United States (US) being the top hosting locations, and law enforcement actions having often only temporary impact  Insikt Group identified several emerging trends in 2024.\nNotably, malware-as-a-service (MaaS) infostealers, led by LummaC2, grew in prevalence, likely driven by law enforcement actions against competitor infostealers and rapid innovation by LummaC2. Additionally, Android remained the primary target for mobile malware, with Hook leading. While Latrodectus dominated droppers and loaders despite law enforcement disruptions in the loader ecosystem, traffic distribution systems (TDSs) continued to enhance cybercrime efficiency, as seen with TAG-124, and the abuse of content delivery networks (CDNs) like Cloudflare surged. In regards to state-sponsored groups, China notably increased its use of relay networks such as ArcSilt, while Russia continued its abuse of a wide range of legitimate internet services (LIS).\nDefenders should leverage this report's insights to strengthen security controls by prioritizing top malware and infrastructure techniques, and thereby enhance network monitoring and deploy relevant detections like YARA, Sigma, and Snort. This should be complemented by investments in tracking evolving malicious infrastructure dynamics, conducting threat simulations to test defenses, and effectively monitoring the broader threat landscape. Regarding LIS, defenders must balance blocking, flagging, or allowing high-risk services based on their assessed criticality and risk level.\nAs malicious infrastructure evolves and detection improves, Insikt Group expects existing trends to persist in 2025, driven by continuous threat actor innovation rather than drastic shifts. For example, the \"as-a-service\" ecosystem will likely expand, and threat actors will increasingly rely on legitimate tools, services, and CDNs to evade detection. Furthermore, with growing mobile reliance, Insikt Group expects mobile-based threats to continue to rise. Relay networks, primarily used by Chinese state-sponsored groups up until now, may see broader adoption by cybercriminals and other state-sponsored groups. Lastly, law enforcement actions are expected to have a greater impact due to enhanced international cooperation and accrued expertise in large-scale cybercrime takedowns.\nKey Findings\n\nMaaS infostealers led in infections in 2024, with LummaC2 dominating command-and-control (C2) servers as continuous innovation and law enforcement actions against rivals like RedLine Stealer reshaped the cybercrime ecosystem.\nAsyncRAT and Quasar RAT remained the top remote access tools (RATs), while MaaS-based malware like DcRAT continued widespread use.\nThe US (North America), Brazil (South America), Angola (Africa), France (Europe), India (Asia), and Australia (Oceania) recorded the highest number of victims in their respective regions based on Recorded Future Network Intelligence, with AsyncRAT emerging as the most prevalent malware in most cases. Other significant threats included QuasarRAT and Cobalt Strike.\nAndroid remained the primary target for mobile malware, with nine of the top ten families focusing on it, alongside the rise of mercenary spyware and potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) like stalkerware.\nCobalt Strike accounted for two-thirds of offensive security tool command-and-control (C2) servers, with jQuery as the most popular malleable profile and cs2modrewrite targeting the most victim countries. Cobalt Strike is followed by Metasploit, with detections of Sliver and Brute Ratel C4 rising significantly.\nMozi Botnet was the largest tracked botnet in 2024 based on the number of identified bots, while older botnets remained active, being primarily used for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, as well as credential theft and localized attacks, as seen with Fenix Botnet.\nLatrodectus dominated all droppers and loaders in 2024, accounting for 33% of detections, likely driven by law enforcement disruptions in the loader ecosystem, while most top families emerged post-2021, indicating shorter lifespans.\nTDS continued to play a crucial role in cybercrime by improving efficiency, targeting, and profitability while evading detection, exemplified by TAG-124, which served a broad user base, including ransomware groups like Rhysida.\nThe US and China dominated malicious hosting, while bulletproof hosting providers like Stark Industries played a growing role in cybercrime infrastructure.\nChinese state-sponsored groups expanded their use of anonymization networks in 2024 to target entities worldwide, enabling them to blend with legitimate traffic and complicate victim identification, while RedDelta used Cloudflare to proxy C2 traffic and geo-fence malicious files.\nRussian state-sponsored groups increasingly relied on legitimate services like Ngrok, Cloudflare, and Telegram to evade detection, with BlueDelta shifting to Ngrok after takedown efforts and BlueAlpha using Cloudflare Tunnels to stage GammaDrop malware.\n\nIntroduction\nInsikt Group proactively identifies and monitors infrastructure associated with hundreds of malware families, threat actors, and other artifacts, including phishing kits, scanners, and relay networks. By automatically validating malicious infrastructure through various proprietary methods on a daily basis, Insikt Group provides accurate risk representation, enabling Recorded Future customers to enhance their detection and defense capabilities.\nBuilding on Insikt Group's annual adversary infrastructure reports from 2022 and 2023, the 2024 Malicious Infrastructure Report provides a concise, data-based overview of malicious infrastructure observed throughout 2024. This year, it specifically emphasizes the synergy among passive infrastructure detection, higher-tier infrastructure insights powered by Recorded Future Network Intelligence, and victim identification. Overall, this report is for anyone interested in malicious infrastructure, offering a high-level overview of its current state as well as summaries of key findings to inform decision-making and provide a broad perspective in this highly dynamic environment.\nRecognizing the challenge of categorizing malware types in a mutually exclusive manner due to their overlapping functionalities, this report establishes a set of malware categories to facilitate analysis, as detailed in Appendix A, with brief definitions for each. Notably, certain malware categories, such as crypters, have been intentionally excluded due to the usual absence of network artifacts.\nBeyond examining malicious infrastructure through the lens of malware categories, Insikt Group also monitors it by type, with each type assigned a distinct risk scoring within the Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud. This differentiation reflects varying levels of severity  for instance, network traffic to or from a C2 server in a corporate network may indicate higher risk compared to a management panel, as it typically implies active malicious activity. The infrastructure types defined by Insikt Group are detailed in Appendix B.\n2024 Malicious Infrastructure Insights by the Numbers\nProactively identifying malicious infrastructure is a complex task shaped by various factors. In addition to the vast volume of data, each malware family, version, or infrastructure linked to specific threat actors often employs entirely unique setups. Detection becomes even more challenging due to factors such as hosting behind CDNs like Cloudflare, the use of high or random ports, reliance on legitimate internet services such as Discord or Telegram, or the exploitation of compromised infrastructure.\nThese setups also evolve continuously, demanding that Insikt Group constantly innovate and refine its tracking methodologies. Considering all these factors, this report examines malicious infrastructure across multiple categories, including infostealers, backdoors and RATs, mobile malware, OSTs, botnets, droppers and loaders, phishing kits, web shells, and ransomware.\nOverall, in 2024, there has been a significant rise in identified malicious infrastructure, driven by an evolving threat landscape and advancements in detection methodologies by Insikt Group. For instance, the number of unique, validated C2 servers doubled from 2023 to 2024, while unique, validated management panels saw a 69% increase over the same period.\nIn addition, using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified victims in approximately 200 countries worldwide in 2024 based on victim IP address geolocation. Countries in Figure 1 were categorized into five groups based on the number of unique victims detected, with those showing high exposure being geographically dispersed worldwide. Notably, accurately measuring malware impact across countries is challenging due to variations in population size, digital footprint, analytical biases (for example, the types of malware tracked), internet infrastructure (such as proxies), and the geographical hosting choices of victim organizations.\nFigure 1: Malware impact by country based on Recorded Future Network Intelligence (Source: Recorded Future)\nFigure 2 shows the distribution of victims by country across different continents. In North America, the US is the most targeted country, accounting for around 87% of unique victims in the region despite making up only about half of its population. The high victim count in the US is likely driven by factors such as its large population, extensive digital footprint, widespread English use (exploited in phishing campaigns), and economics, while also being influenced by the country's role as a global infrastructure hub, providing hosting and digital services to organizations worldwide. Most victims are linked to AsyncRAT, followed by SolarMarker RAT and QuasarRAT (see Table 1). Notably, unlike AsyncRAT and QuasarRAT, SolarMarker RAT is believed to be operated by a single threat actor and has previously been observed predominantly targeting the US.\nFigure 2: Shares of unique victim by country and continent (Source: Recorded Future)\nIn South America, Brazil recorded the highest number of unique victims, accounting for 86% of the regions total, while also only making up around half of the continents population. Previously identified as one of the countries most vulnerable to cyberattacks, Brazil has long been a hotspot for both global and local cyber threats, ranking high in cybercrime activity, with groups like Grandoreiro operating almost exclusively within its borders. In 2024, QuasarRAT infections were the most prevalent among Brazilian victims, followed by infections linked to AsyncRAT and SectopRAT.\nIn Africa, Angola recorded the highest number of unique victims, followed by Ghana, South Africa, the Republic of the Congo, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Notably, in two of the five most targeted African countries, PlugX, a malware linked to multiple Chinese state-sponsored groups, ranked among the most prevalent malware.\nIn Europe, France had the highest number of unique victims, followed by Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Poland. AsyncRAT was the most prevalent malware across all five countries, with Cobalt Strike ranking second in three of them. The distribution of victims in these top five countries closely aligns with their population sizes. Notably, in the Netherlands, GobRAT  a backdoor targeting Linux routers with malware written in Go  ranked among the top three malware families.\nIn Asia, India recorded the highest number of unique victims, followed by China, Indonesia, Thailand, and Hong Kong.

The critical infrastructure sectors Cityworks services include water and wastewater systems, energy, transportation systems, government services and facilities, and communications. \nThe vulnerability affects Cityworks versions before 15.8.9 and Cityworks with Office Companion versions before 23.10. \nSuccessfully exploiting CVE-2025-0994 can allow authenticated attackers to conduct remote code execution (RCE) against a targets Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) web server. \nFigure 1: Login page on an exposed Cityworks instance (Source: Recorded Future)\nInsikt Groups Assessment of CVE-2025-0994\nIndicators of compromise (IoCs) shared by Trimble suggest that the vulnerability is being exploited to deliver custom Rust-based loaders capable of loading VShell and Cobalt Strike into memory. Additionally, the threat actors delivered an obfuscated JavaScript payload located in the %TEMP% folder, two unknown files, three malicious executables with randomized, alphanumeric filenames (for example, fq1u4t83[.]exe), and two files masquerading as legitimate services (winpty.dll and winpty-agent[.]exe). \nThe malicious files were likely downloaded into the victim's environment from threat actor-controlled Cobalt Strike C2 servers. \nBased on the IoCs shared by Trimble, the threat actors used 192.210.239[.]172:3219 and 192.210.239[.]172:4219 as staging infrastructure. Insikt Group has validated this IP address as a C2 server for Cobalt Strike. \nThere is insufficient evidence to definitively confirm which files were transferred from the threat actors infrastructure; however, the obfuscated alphanumeric-named executables stored in the \\Temp folder or the JavaScript payload are two possibilities.\nAt the time of writing, there were 111 exposed Cityworks instances on Shodan, 21% of which are vulnerable based on identified version numbers. The majority of exposed instances are also geolocated in the US and include multiple .gov domains.\n\nFigure 2: Nearly 95% of exposed Cityworks instances on Shodan are geolocated in the US (Sources: Shodan, Recorded Future)\nTrimble shared the following list of IoCs related to their observed exploitation of CVE-2025-0994:\ntable td:first-child{width:33%;min-width:33%;max-width:33%;word-break:break-all}\n\nIoCTypeDescription\n4b7561e27c87a1895446d7f2b83e2d9fcf71e6d6e8bc99d44818dc39a6ff99d5SHA-256Obfuscated JavaScript payload\n4ffc33bdc8527a2e8cb87e49cdc16c3b1480dfc135e507d552f581a67d1850a9SHA-256VShell loader\n8a6c735f3608719ec9f46d9c6c5fc196db8c97065957c218b98733a491edd899SHA-256Unknown\n883d849b94238c26c57c0595ccb95b8c356628887b9a3628bf56e726332af925SHA-256Cobalt Strike loader\n151a71c43e63db802d41d5d715aa98eb1b236e0a6441076a8d30fd93990416b4SHA-256Unknown\n1de72c03927bcd2810ce98205ff871ef1ebf4344fba187e126e50caa1e43250bSHA-256Cobalt Strike loader\n14a072113baa0a1e1e2b6044068c7bc972ae5e541a0aec06577b0d6663140079SHA-256Unknown malicious file fq1u4t83[.]exe\n04dc3a16e1e2b4924943805a1cea5e402c4f2304c717ea21fdf43274b8c34a84SHA-256Unknown malicious file q0pe6x96[.]exe\nf09b51b759dfe7de06fa724bd89592f5b8eae57053d5fb4891e40f24055103fbSHA-256Unknown malicious file szm9wz8m[.]exe\nC:\\windows\\temp\\z1[.]exeFile pathMalicious binary download path\nC:\\windows\\temp\\z2[.]exeFile pathMalicious binary download path\nC:\\windows\\temp\\z44[.]exeFile pathMalicious binary download path\nC:\\windows\\temp\\z55[.]exeFile pathMalicious binary download path\nC:\\Windows\\Temp\\UDGEZR[.]exeFile pathMalicious binary download path\nC:\\Windows\\Temp\\z55.exe_winpty\\winpty-agent[.]exe File pathPUTTY binary download path\nC:\\Windows\\Temp\\z55.exe_winpty\\winpty[.]dllFile pathPUTTY binary download path\n192.210.239[.]172:3219IPv4:portStaging IP address\n192.210.239[.]172:4219IPv4:portStaging IP address\n23.247.136[.]238IPv4Threat actor-controlled IP address\n31.59.70[.]13IPv4Threat actor-controlled IP address\n31.59.70[.]11IPv4Threat actor-controlled IP address\n149.112.117[.]49IPv4Threat actor-controlled IP address\n192.210.137[.]81IPv4Threat actor-controlled IP address\n192.210.183[.]118IPv4Threat actor-controlled IP address\ncdn.phototagx[.]comDomainThreat actor-controlled callback domain\nifode[.]xyzDomainThreat actor-controlled domain\nhttps[:]//cdn.lgaircon[.]xyz[:]443/jquery-3.3.1.min.jsURICobalt Strike C2\nhttps[:]//192.210.239[.]172/messages/73KWf-o0-s0hxVCDJp1sfAHRcgdm7URICobalt Strike C2\n\nTable 1: IoCs shared by Trimble related to their observed exploitation of CVE-2025-0994 (Source: Trimble)\nRecommended Actions\nOrganizations should upgrade to Cityworks version 15.8.9 or later, and Cityworks with Office Companion version 23.10 or later.

This not only impacts critical infrastructure directly, but also could lead to secondary disruptions at organizations that depend on that infrastructure.\nReal-world threats:\n\nVolt Typhoon pre-positioning for disruptive attacks in energy, communications, and transportation sectors\nPro-Russia hacktivists virtually manipulating operational technology systems\n\nPriority actions:\nCISOs must understand how geopolitical events affect their security posture to manage risk and communicate with their boards effectively.\n\nUse strategic foresight techniques, including Horizon Scanning, PESTLE-M, and the Cone of Plausibility, to understand the external environment, anticipate whats ahead, and make better intelligence-informed decisions\nExplore Recorded Futures Geopolitical Intelligence Module, which includes a Country Risk Scores help you understand and prioritize risks associated with operating in different countries.\n\n\n\nOutlook #2: SaaS will make it easier to weaponize stolen credentials.\nCybercriminals are increasingly targeting interconnected software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications to gain access to enterprise ecosystems.  With the average organization now using approximately 371 SaaS apps, and with 77% of SaaS app attacks beginning with stolen credentials, its essential to prioritize identity security. \nCredentials are frequently stolen by information-stealing malware, or infostealers, that are built to target a variety of operating systems and mobile devices. Per Recorded Future research, credential theft per device has risen 25% since 2021, increasing the risk of unlocking valuable corporate assets or credential stuffing attacks.\nReal-world threats:\n\nThe recent high profile breaches have used credentials stolen from infostealers from as far back as 2020 to gain access to over 165 companies cloud storage instances. \nEven with MFA, threat actors were able to use subtle social engineering strategies,to gain access to corporate systems.\n\nPriority actions:\n\nConsider AMFA with biometric authentication to provide an extra layer of protection from unauthorized access.\nUse Recorded Futures Identity Intelligence Module to track stolen credentials for your organization \nReach out to learn more about your organizations identity exposures with our free Exposure Assessment Report.\n\n\n\nOutlook #3: Generative AI will transform social engineering.\nThe reported 1,265% increase in phishing attacks between Q4 2022 and November 2023 has been attributed to the public release of LLMs like ChatGPT. Spear phishing attacks have become more dangerous now that threat actors can use generative AI to quickly create highly targeted and convincing messages as well as deepfake phone calls and videos (TechTarget). \nIn addition to phishing, the increasing availability of sophisticated faceswap and other deepfake technology means more threat actors will be able to produce believable impersonations of company executives, celebrities, and political figures, pulling off increasingly costly scams.\nReal-world threats:\n\nLosses to impersonation scams topped $1.1 billion in 2023.\n26% of politically themed deepfakes were used to commit fraud.\n\nPriority actions:\n\nAdapt phishing training to include detecting voice and video fraud\nEnsure processes for transferring money or data are resilient to scams by increasing validation checkpoints and educating employees on suspicious requests\n\n\n\nOutlook #4: Regulatory demands and AI capabilities will push demand for safer code.\nNew regulations in both the US and EU are pushing software companies to prioritize security.

As of mid-February 2025, Insikt Group assesses that, despite their persistence, these efforts have very likely not meaningfully altered voter behavior or shaped public opinion in a manner advantageous to Russias broader geopolitical interests, consistent with <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-impact-of-russian-interference-on-germanys-2017-elections/\">assessments</a> of Russian meddling attempts in previous German election cycles. </p><p>The influence operations and corresponding networks tracked in this report  Doppelgnger, Operation Overload, CopyCop, Operation Undercut, and the Russia-based Foundation to Battle Injustice  are longstanding and at least partially Kremlin-funded. These operations almost certainly seek to incite and escalate German domestic socio-political conflicts, pollute the German information space by introducing manipulated content, foster criticism of the United States (US) and European Union (EU) and European integration, and undermine North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) cohesion in line with the Kremlins strategic objectives.</p><p>The 2025 German election cycle marks a period of evolution for several of these operations, while core narratives remain unchanged. For example, Doppelgnger and Operation Overload have expanded beyond mainstream social media to Bluesky Social (Bluesky), in an attempt to capture migrating audiences. Doppelgnger and CopyCop have launched new brands and websites to project influence and reinforce messaging in the face of intensified scrutiny of their operations. Operation Overload continues to use artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools, including the use of AI-enabled voice cloning technology to create audio deepfakes, while both Operation Overload and Operation Undercut pose as real news organizations to increase their credibility.</p><p>Despite limited evidence that these operations have meaningfully influenced voter behavior, they still pose broader risks to media integrity and public trust. Narratives undermining election security or integrity could reduce voter turnout, while media engagement with inauthentic content  rather than exposing the tactics behind it  may amplify malign messaging. Regarding Operation Overload specifically, we continue to assess that the potential for significant breakout does exist, as evidenced in the <a href=\"https://meduza.io/en/feature/2025/02/06/elon-musk-and-trump-jr-repost-fake-e-news-video-about-usaid-created-by-pro-kremlin-disinformation-network\">viral spread</a> of a recent video attributed to this network that disparaged the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in social media. To mitigate these risks, media entities, the public sector, and researchers should continue monitoring known influence networks while limiting engagement with operations such as Doppelgnger, Operation Overload, and Operation Undercut. Impersonated organizations should engage takedown services for malicious domains, collaborate with platform trust and safety teams, and proactively detect brand abuse tactics like typosquatting and logo manipulation.</p><h2 id=\"key-findings\">Key Findings</h2><ul><li>The German federal elections are the target of malign influence operations attributed to Russia and Russia-based actors.</li><li>Russia-attributed influence operations have promoted and will very likely continue to support German political parties Russia views as beneficial to its own geopolitical interests, particularly Alternative fr Deutschland (AfD). </li><li>Doppelgnger is very likely exerting influence through at least seven new inauthentic news brands, in addition to the operations persistent media impersonation activities, to exacerbate political fissures and inflame political discourse surrounding European integration, immigration, and economic matters. </li><li>Operation Overloads media impersonations aim to sow distrust among German citizens toward the safety and integrity of voting, attack the characters of key political leaders, and present Germany as a rising hotbed of antisemitism and extremism.</li><li>Insikt Group detected at least 94 new inauthentic websites  whose creation began in November 2024 after the announcement of upcoming snap elections  that we attribute to CopyCop impersonating German-language news websites.</li><li>Following Insikt Groups November 2024 investigation into Operation Undercut, we have observed the network continuing to post German-language content supporting AfD and undermining German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.</li><li>The Foundation to Battle Injustice very likely seeks to undermine the reputations of German political leaders while promoting political platforms aligned with Russian interests through inauthentic investigative articles.</li></ul><h2 id=\"new-doppelgnger-brands-target-key-german-election-issues\">New Doppelgnger Brands Target Key German Election Issues</h2><p>Insikt Group has detected at least eight new websites acting as original news brands, in addition to continued media impersonation with social media promotion, which we attribute to Doppelgnger, a longstanding Russian influence operation. <a href=\"https://www.disinfo.eu/doppelganger-operation/\">Doppelgnger</a> is very likely positioning these newly established websites  previously not linked to the network  to sustain its influence operations targeting European political leadership and to exacerbate political fissures surrounding European integration, immigration, economic matters, and more. Throughout 2024, researchers, government entities, and technology companies <a href=\"https://www.qurium.org/alerts/exposing-the-evil-empire-of-doppelganger-disinformation/\">continued</a> <a href=\"https://www.qurium.org/forensics/when-kehr-meets-vextrio/\">exposing</a> Doppelgnger&#39;s activities across Europe and North America, leading to a US Department of Justice <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-disrupts-covert-russian-government-sponsored-foreign-malign-influence\">indictment</a> against its operators at the Social Design Agency (SDA), international sanctions on SDA and affiliated entities, and at least partial  though often temporary  disruptions to its operations through takedowns and seizures. In response, SDA typically attempted to reestablish its operations within hours to days by deploying new infrastructure.</p><p>While Doppelgnger is best known for the <a href=\"https://www.disinfo.eu/doppelganger/\">direct impersonation</a> of legitimate Western media organizations, the influence operation has also managed a multitude of its own original news website brands, each targeting a specific country (such as Germany), with content directly tailored to the key domestic and foreign policy issues of that target audience, such as immigration policy, Germanys ongoing socio-economic challenges, and questions of Germanys place as Europes leader (as seen in <strong>Figure 1</strong>). Insikt Group has observed Doppelgnger abandoning several of its legacy brand websites with attempts to establish new brands, including multiple websites specific to German politics, likely due to a combination of repeated discovery and disruption of several of these websites. </p><p>While we continue to observe Doppelgnger evolve its tactics and attempt to evade defenders, its ability to meaningfully impact public discourse very likely remains limited. Despite continued efforts to expand its network, Doppelgnger remains constrained by low levels of engagement, with minimal views and interactions across its newly launched domains and social media brands.</p><h3 id=\"using-new-infrastructure-to-deliver-old-themes\">Using New Infrastructure to Deliver Old Themes</h3><p>Since October 2024, Insikt Group has tracked a series of new domain registrations, discovering web page infrastructure that overlaps with previously attributed Doppelgnger-controlled domains. As of February 2025, Doppelgnger has registered ten domains that include eight new websites and two parked domains.

As of mid-February 2025, Insikt Group assesses that, despite their persistence, these efforts have very likely not meaningfully altered voter behavior or shaped public opinion in a manner advantageous to Russias broader geopolitical interests, consistent with assessments of Russian meddling attempts in previous German election cycles. \nThe influence operations and corresponding networks tracked in this report  Doppelgnger, Operation Overload, CopyCop, Operation Undercut, and the Russia-based Foundation to Battle Injustice  are longstanding and at least partially Kremlin-funded. These operations almost certainly seek to incite and escalate German domestic socio-political conflicts, pollute the German information space by introducing manipulated content, foster criticism of the United States (US) and European Union (EU) and European integration, and undermine North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) cohesion in line with the Kremlins strategic objectives.\nThe 2025 German election cycle marks a period of evolution for several of these operations, while core narratives remain unchanged. For example, Doppelgnger and Operation Overload have expanded beyond mainstream social media to Bluesky Social (Bluesky), in an attempt to capture migrating audiences. Doppelgnger and CopyCop have launched new brands and websites to project influence and reinforce messaging in the face of intensified scrutiny of their operations. Operation Overload continues to use artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools, including the use of AI-enabled voice cloning technology to create audio deepfakes, while both Operation Overload and Operation Undercut pose as real news organizations to increase their credibility.\nDespite limited evidence that these operations have meaningfully influenced voter behavior, they still pose broader risks to media integrity and public trust. Narratives undermining election security or integrity could reduce voter turnout, while media engagement with inauthentic content  rather than exposing the tactics behind it  may amplify malign messaging. Regarding Operation Overload specifically, we continue to assess that the potential for significant breakout does exist, as evidenced in the viral spread of a recent video attributed to this network that disparaged the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in social media. To mitigate these risks, media entities, the public sector, and researchers should continue monitoring known influence networks while limiting engagement with operations such as Doppelgnger, Operation Overload, and Operation Undercut. Impersonated organizations should engage takedown services for malicious domains, collaborate with platform trust and safety teams, and proactively detect brand abuse tactics like typosquatting and logo manipulation.\nKey Findings\n\nThe German federal elections are the target of malign influence operations attributed to Russia and Russia-based actors.\nRussia-attributed influence operations have promoted and will very likely continue to support German political parties Russia views as beneficial to its own geopolitical interests, particularly Alternative fr Deutschland (AfD). \nDoppelgnger is very likely exerting influence through at least seven new inauthentic news brands, in addition to the operations persistent media impersonation activities, to exacerbate political fissures and inflame political discourse surrounding European integration, immigration, and economic matters. \nOperation Overloads media impersonations aim to sow distrust among German citizens toward the safety and integrity of voting, attack the characters of key political leaders, and present Germany as a rising hotbed of antisemitism and extremism.\nInsikt Group detected at least 94 new inauthentic websites  whose creation began in November 2024 after the announcement of upcoming snap elections  that we attribute to CopyCop impersonating German-language news websites.\nFollowing Insikt Groups November 2024 investigation into Operation Undercut, we have observed the network continuing to post German-language content supporting AfD and undermining German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.\nThe Foundation to Battle Injustice very likely seeks to undermine the reputations of German political leaders while promoting political platforms aligned with Russian interests through inauthentic investigative articles.\n\nNew Doppelgnger Brands Target Key German Election Issues\nInsikt Group has detected at least eight new websites acting as original news brands, in addition to continued media impersonation with social media promotion, which we attribute to Doppelgnger, a longstanding Russian influence operation. Doppelgnger is very likely positioning these newly established websites  previously not linked to the network  to sustain its influence operations targeting European political leadership and to exacerbate political fissures surrounding European integration, immigration, economic matters, and more. Throughout 2024, researchers, government entities, and technology companies continued exposing Doppelgnger's activities across Europe and North America, leading to a US Department of Justice indictment against its operators at the Social Design Agency (SDA), international sanctions on SDA and affiliated entities, and at least partial  though often temporary  disruptions to its operations through takedowns and seizures. In response, SDA typically attempted to reestablish its operations within hours to days by deploying new infrastructure.\nWhile Doppelgnger is best known for the direct impersonation of legitimate Western media organizations, the influence operation has also managed a multitude of its own original news website brands, each targeting a specific country (such as Germany), with content directly tailored to the key domestic and foreign policy issues of that target audience, such as immigration policy, Germanys ongoing socio-economic challenges, and questions of Germanys place as Europes leader (as seen in Figure 1). Insikt Group has observed Doppelgnger abandoning several of its legacy brand websites with attempts to establish new brands, including multiple websites specific to German politics, likely due to a combination of repeated discovery and disruption of several of these websites. \nWhile we continue to observe Doppelgnger evolve its tactics and attempt to evade defenders, its ability to meaningfully impact public discourse very likely remains limited. Despite continued efforts to expand its network, Doppelgnger remains constrained by low levels of engagement, with minimal views and interactions across its newly launched domains and social media brands.\nUsing New Infrastructure to Deliver Old Themes\nSince October 2024, Insikt Group has tracked a series of new domain registrations, discovering web page infrastructure that overlaps with previously attributed Doppelgnger-controlled domains. As of February 2025, Doppelgnger has registered ten domains that include eight new websites and two parked domains.

Victim organizations included a United States-based affiliate of a United Kingdom-based telecommunications provider and a South African telecommunications provider. Insikt Group attributes this activity to the Chinese state-sponsored threat activity group tracked by Insikt Group as RedMike, which aligns with the Microsoft-named group Salt Typhoon. Using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group observed RedMike target and exploit unpatched Cisco network devices vulnerable to CVE-2023-20198, a privilege escalation vulnerability found in the web user interface (UI) feature in Cisco IOS XE software, for initial access before exploiting an associated privilege escalation vulnerability, CVE-2023-20273, to gain root privileges. RedMike reconfigures the device, adding a generic routing encapsulation (GRE) tunnel for persistent access.</p><p>RedMike has attempted to exploit more than 1,000 Cisco devices globally. The group likely compiled a list of target devices based on their association with telecommunications providers&#39; networks. Insikt Group also observed RedMike targeting devices associated with universities in Argentina, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Thailand, the United States (US), and Vietnam. RedMike possibly targeted these universities to access research in areas related to telecommunications, engineering, and technology, particularly at institutions like UCLA and TU Delft. In addition to this activity, in mid-December 2024, RedMike also carried out a reconnaissance of multiple IP addresses owned by a Myanmar-based telecommunications provider, Mytel.</p><p>Unpatched public-facing appliances serve as direct entry points into an organizations infrastructure. Sophisticated Chinese threat activity groups have <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2023-1107.pdf\">shifted</a> heavily toward exploiting these devices for initial access over the past five years. RedMikes exploitation of telecommunications infrastructure goes beyond technical vulnerabilities and represents a strategic intelligence threat. Persistent access to critical communications networks enables state-backed threat actors to monitor confidential conversations, manipulate data flows, and disrupt services during geopolitical conflicts. RedMikes targeting of lawful intercept programs and US political figures highlights the strategic intelligence objectives behind these operations and the national security threat they pose.</p><p>Organizations, particularly those in the telecommunications industry, must prioritize remediating exposed network devices, as unpatched systems remain a key initial access vector for Chinese state-sponsored threat activity groups. Network administrators should implement strict access controls, disable unnecessary web UI exposure, and monitor for unauthorized configuration changes. Individuals should use end-to-end encrypted communication methods for sensitive information, just as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) recommended, which is crucial to mitigate potential eavesdropping risks.</p><p>Additionally, governments and cybersecurity entities should improve threat intelligence sharing and impose stricter regulatory compliance for network security. While the US sanctions on RedMike-affiliated Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology signal a more assertive and commendable stance against state-backed cyber espionage in critical infrastructure, robust international cooperation is crucial for effectively countering these persistent threats.</p><h2 id=\"key-findings\">Key Findings</h2><ul><li>Despite significant media coverage and US sanctions, RedMike continues to compromise telecommunications providers globally, including in the US.</li><li>RedMike compromised Cisco network devices of a US-based affiliate of a United Kingdom (UK) telecommunications provider and a South African telecommunications provider.</li><li>RedMike exploited privilege escalation vulnerabilities CVE-2023-20198 and CVE-2023-20273 to compromise unpatched Cisco network devices running Cisco IOS XE software.</li><li>Using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified RedMike attempting to exploit over 1,000 Cisco network devices between December 2024 and January 2025.</li></ul><h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2><p>In late September 2024, media reporting (<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/china-cyberattack-internet-providers-260bd835?st=cYA8J5&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.securityweek.com/chinas-salt-typhoon-hacked-att-verizon-report/\">2</a>) stated that the Chinese state-sponsored group Salt Typhoon had compromised the networks of major US telecommunications companies, including Verizon (<a href=\"\">1</a>), AT&amp;T, and Lumen Technologies. The activity likely affected telecommunications organizations globally, with some outlets <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/national-security-daily/2024/12/12/we-need-to-talk-about-salt-typhoon-00183727\">reporting</a> that Salt Typhoon compromised at least 80 organizations. SaltTyphoon used its access to telecommunications providers to snoop on <a href=\"https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/salt-typhoon-apt-subverts-law-enforcement-wiretapping\">US lawful intercept</a> targets and <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/25/trump-hack-china-phones-00185608\">intercept</a> the communications of significant US political figures. The effect of Salt Typhoons intrusions has reached the highest levels of the US government: Cybersecurity experts have <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-agencies-brief-senators-chinese-salt-typhoon-telecom-hacking-2024-12-04/\">briefed</a> the US Senate, CISA recently <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/enhanced-visibility-and-hardening-guidance-communications-infrastructure\">issued</a> guidance on hardening telecommunications infrastructure, and CISA and the FBI issued a joint <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/12/06/fbi-warns-iphone-and-android-users-stop-sending-texts/\">warning</a> encouraging the use of encrypted end-to-end messaging applications for sensitive communications.</p><p>Insikt Group tracks Salt Typhoon-aligned activity as RedMike.

When successfully compromised, the group uses the new privileged user account to change the device&#39;s configuration and adds a GRE tunnel for persistent access and data exfiltration.</p><p>The privilege escalation vulnerability CVE-2023-20198 was found in the Cisco IOS XE software web UI feature, version 16 and earlier, and <a href=\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxe-webui-privesc-j22SaA4z\">published</a> by Cisco in October 2023. Attackers exploit this vulnerability to gain initial access to the device and issue a <span style=\"font-family: Courier;\">privilege 15</style> command to create a local user and password. Following this, the attacker uses the new local account to access the device and exploits an associated privilege escalation vulnerability, CVE-2023-20273, to gain root user privileges.</p><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/redmike_salt_01_5eec44df76.png\" alt=\"RedMike Cisco network\"><em><strong>Figure 1:</strong> RedMike Cisco network device exploitation infrastructure (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><p>More than half of the Cisco devices targeted by RedMike were in the US, South America, and India. The remaining devices spanned over 100 other countries. Although the selected devices are primarily associated with telecommunications providers, thirteen were linked to universities across Argentina, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Thailand, the US, and Vietnam.</p><p>Often involved in cutting-edge research, universities are prime targets for Chinese state-sponsored threat activity groups to acquire valuable research data and intellectual property. Previous examples include APT40, which has <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa21-200a\">targeted</a> universities for biomedical, robotics, and maritime research; RedGolf (APT41) <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/seven-international-cyber-defendants-including-apt41-actors-charged-connection-computer\">for</a> medical research; and RedBravo (APT31), which has directly <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/apt31-chinese-hacking-group-behind-global-cyberespionage-campaign-2024-03-26/\">targeted</a> academics. Chinas cyber strategy <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2023-1107.pdf\">aligns</a> with its broader economic and military goals, making universities high-value targets for long-term intelligence-gathering and technology acquisition.</p><p>RedMike possibly targeted the following universities to access research in areas related to telecommunications, engineering, and technology, particularly at institutions like <a href=\"https://wireless.ee.ucla.edu/research/\">UCLA</a> and <a href=\"https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/ee/msc-electrical-engineering/track-wireless-communication-and-sensing/related-research/\">TU Delft</a>.</p><ul><li>University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)  US</li><li>California State University, Office of the Chancellor (CENIC)  US</li><li>Loyola Marymount University  US</li><li>Utah Tech University  US</li><li>Universidad de La Punta  Argentina</li><li>Islamic University of Technology (IUT)  Bangladesh</li><li>Universitas Sebelas Maret  Indonesia</li><li>Universitas Negeri Malang  Indonesia</li><li>University of Malaya  Malaysia</li><li>Universidad Nacional Autonoma  Mexico</li><li>Technische Universiteit Delft  The Netherlands</li><li>Sripatum University  Thailand</li><li>University of Medicine and Pharmacy at Ho Chi Minh City  Vietnam</li></ul><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/redmike_salt_02_976987d723.png\" alt=\"Geographical spread of Cisco\"><em><strong>Figure 2</strong>: Geographical spread of Cisco devices targeted by RedMike (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><p>RedMikes scanning and exploitation activity occurred on six different occasions from December 2024 to January 2025.</p><ul><li>2024-12-04 </li><li>2024-12-10</li><li>2024-12-17</li><li>2024-12-24</li><li>2025-01-13</li><li>2025-01-23</li></ul><p>Network administrators operating a Cisco network device with IOS XE software web UI exposed to the internet can use the dates mentioned and advice in the mitigations section to identify potential RedMike exploitation activity.</p><p>Using internet scanning data, Insikt Group identified more than 12,000 Cisco network devices with their web UIs exposed to the internet. Although over 1,000 Cisco devices were targeted, Insikt Group assesses that this activity was likely focussed, given that this number only represents 8% of the exposed devices and that RedMike engaged in periodic reconnaissance activity, selecting devices linked to telecommunications providers.</p><h3 id=\"compromised-telecommunications-provider-devices\">Compromised Telecommunications Provider Devices</h3><p>Using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group observed seven compromised Cisco network devices communicating with RedMike infrastructure. These include devices associated with:</p><ul><li>A US-based affiliate of a UK telecommunications provider</li><li>A US internet service provider (ISP) and telecommunications company</li><li>A South African telecommunications provider</li><li>An Italian ISP</li><li>A large Thailand telecommunications provider</li></ul><p>RedMike configured GRE tunnels between the compromised Cisco devices and their infrastructure. GRE is a tunneling protocol used to encapsulate various network layer protocols inside point-to-point connections. It is a standard feature that can be configured on Cisco network devices.

Victim organizations included a United States-based affiliate of a United Kingdom-based telecommunications provider and a South African telecommunications provider. Insikt Group attributes this activity to the Chinese state-sponsored threat activity group tracked by Insikt Group as RedMike, which aligns with the Microsoft-named group Salt Typhoon. Using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group observed RedMike target and exploit unpatched Cisco network devices vulnerable to CVE-2023-20198, a privilege escalation vulnerability found in the web user interface (UI) feature in Cisco IOS XE software, for initial access before exploiting an associated privilege escalation vulnerability, CVE-2023-20273, to gain root privileges. RedMike reconfigures the device, adding a generic routing encapsulation (GRE) tunnel for persistent access.\nRedMike has attempted to exploit more than 1,000 Cisco devices globally. The group likely compiled a list of target devices based on their association with telecommunications providers' networks. Insikt Group also observed RedMike targeting devices associated with universities in Argentina, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Thailand, the United States (US), and Vietnam. RedMike possibly targeted these universities to access research in areas related to telecommunications, engineering, and technology, particularly at institutions like UCLA and TU Delft. In addition to this activity, in mid-December 2024, RedMike also carried out a reconnaissance of multiple IP addresses owned by a Myanmar-based telecommunications provider, Mytel.\nUnpatched public-facing appliances serve as direct entry points into an organizations infrastructure. Sophisticated Chinese threat activity groups have shifted heavily toward exploiting these devices for initial access over the past five years. RedMikes exploitation of telecommunications infrastructure goes beyond technical vulnerabilities and represents a strategic intelligence threat. Persistent access to critical communications networks enables state-backed threat actors to monitor confidential conversations, manipulate data flows, and disrupt services during geopolitical conflicts. RedMikes targeting of lawful intercept programs and US political figures highlights the strategic intelligence objectives behind these operations and the national security threat they pose.\nOrganizations, particularly those in the telecommunications industry, must prioritize remediating exposed network devices, as unpatched systems remain a key initial access vector for Chinese state-sponsored threat activity groups. Network administrators should implement strict access controls, disable unnecessary web UI exposure, and monitor for unauthorized configuration changes. Individuals should use end-to-end encrypted communication methods for sensitive information, just as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) recommended, which is crucial to mitigate potential eavesdropping risks.\nAdditionally, governments and cybersecurity entities should improve threat intelligence sharing and impose stricter regulatory compliance for network security. While the US sanctions on RedMike-affiliated Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology signal a more assertive and commendable stance against state-backed cyber espionage in critical infrastructure, robust international cooperation is crucial for effectively countering these persistent threats.\nKey Findings\n\nDespite significant media coverage and US sanctions, RedMike continues to compromise telecommunications providers globally, including in the US.\nRedMike compromised Cisco network devices of a US-based affiliate of a United Kingdom (UK) telecommunications provider and a South African telecommunications provider.\nRedMike exploited privilege escalation vulnerabilities CVE-2023-20198 and CVE-2023-20273 to compromise unpatched Cisco network devices running Cisco IOS XE software.\nUsing Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified RedMike attempting to exploit over 1,000 Cisco network devices between December 2024 and January 2025.\n\nBackground\nIn late September 2024, media reporting (1, 2) stated that the Chinese state-sponsored group Salt Typhoon had compromised the networks of major US telecommunications companies, including Verizon (1), AT&T, and Lumen Technologies. The activity likely affected telecommunications organizations globally, with some outlets reporting that Salt Typhoon compromised at least 80 organizations. SaltTyphoon used its access to telecommunications providers to snoop on US lawful intercept targets and intercept the communications of significant US political figures. The effect of Salt Typhoons intrusions has reached the highest levels of the US government: Cybersecurity experts have briefed the US Senate, CISA recently issued guidance on hardening telecommunications infrastructure, and CISA and the FBI issued a joint warning encouraging the use of encrypted end-to-end messaging applications for sensitive communications.\nInsikt Group tracks Salt Typhoon-aligned activity as RedMike. Salt Typhoon is a group name given by Microsoft Threat Intelligence; at this time, Microsoft has not published publicly available technical details of the group's activity. The only public information Microsoft has shared confirms an overlap with two existing threat activity group names: GhostEmperor (Kaspersky) and FamousSparrow (ESET).\nOn January 17, 2025, the US Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Sichuan-based cybersecurity company Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology Co., Ltd. for their direct involvement with RedMike activity. OFAC stated that Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology Co., Ltd. had direct involvement in exploiting US telecommunications and internet service provider companies. According to OFAC, Chinas Ministry of State Security (MSS) has maintained strong ties with multiple computer network exploitation companies, including Sichuan Juxinhe.\nTechnical Analysis\nCisco IOS XE Web UI Exploitation\nUsing Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified that since early December 2024, RedMike has attempted to exploit over 1,000 internet-facing Cisco network devices worldwide, primarily those associated with telecommunications providers, using a combination of two privilege escalation vulnerabilities: CVE-2023-20198 and CVE-2023-20273. When successfully compromised, the group uses the new privileged user account to change the device's configuration and adds a GRE tunnel for persistent access and data exfiltration.\nThe privilege escalation vulnerability CVE-2023-20198 was found in the Cisco IOS XE software web UI feature, version 16 and earlier, and published by Cisco in October 2023. Attackers exploit this vulnerability to gain initial access to the device and issue a privilege 15 command to create a local user and password. Following this, the attacker uses the new local account to access the device and exploits an associated privilege escalation vulnerability, CVE-2023-20273, to gain root user privileges.\nFigure 1: RedMike Cisco network device exploitation infrastructure (Source: Recorded Future)\nMore than half of the Cisco devices targeted by RedMike were in the US, South America, and India. The remaining devices spanned over 100 other countries. Although the selected devices are primarily associated with telecommunications providers, thirteen were linked to universities across Argentina, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Thailand, the US, and Vietnam.\nOften involved in cutting-edge research, universities are prime targets for Chinese state-sponsored threat activity groups to acquire valuable research data and intellectual property. Previous examples include APT40, which has targeted universities for biomedical, robotics, and maritime research; RedGolf (APT41) for medical research; and RedBravo (APT31), which has directly targeted academics. Chinas cyber strategy aligns with its broader economic and military goals, making universities high-value targets for long-term intelligence-gathering and technology acquisition.\nRedMike possibly targeted the following universities to access research in areas related to telecommunications, engineering, and technology, particularly at institutions like UCLA and TU Delft.\n\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)  US\nCalifornia State University, Office of the Chancellor (CENIC)  US\nLoyola Marymount University  US\nUtah Tech University  US\nUniversidad de La Punta  Argentina\nIslamic University of Technology (IUT)  Bangladesh\nUniversitas Sebelas Maret  Indonesia\nUniversitas Negeri Malang  Indonesia\nUniversity of Malaya  Malaysia\nUniversidad Nacional Autonoma  Mexico\nTechnische Universiteit Delft  The Netherlands\nSripatum University  Thailand\nUniversity of Medicine and Pharmacy at Ho Chi Minh City  Vietnam\n\nFigure 2: Geographical spread of Cisco devices targeted by RedMike (Source: Recorded Future)\nRedMikes scanning and exploitation activity occurred on six different occasions from December 2024 to January 2025.\n\n2024-12-04 \n2024-12-10\n2024-12-17\n2024-12-24\n2025-01-13\n2025-01-23\n\nNetwork administrators operating a Cisco network device with IOS XE software web UI exposed to the internet can use the dates mentioned and advice in the mitigations section to identify potential RedMike exploitation activity.\nUsing internet scanning data, Insikt Group identified more than 12,000 Cisco network devices with their web UIs exposed to the internet. Although over 1,000 Cisco devices were targeted, Insikt Group assesses that this activity was likely focussed, given that this number only represents 8% of the exposed devices and that RedMike engaged in periodic reconnaissance activity, selecting devices linked to telecommunications providers.\nCompromised Telecommunications Provider Devices\nUsing Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group observed seven compromised Cisco network devices communicating with RedMike infrastructure. These include devices associated with:\n\nA US-based affiliate of a UK telecommunications provider\nA US internet service provider (ISP) and telecommunications company\nA South African telecommunications provider\nAn Italian ISP\nA large Thailand telecommunications provider\n\nRedMike configured GRE tunnels between the compromised Cisco devices and their infrastructure. GRE is a tunneling protocol used to encapsulate various network layer protocols inside point-to-point connections. It is a standard feature that can be configured on Cisco network devices. It is commonly used to create virtual private networks (VPNs), enable interoperability between different network types, and transport multicast or non-IP traffic over IP networks. Threat activity groups use GRE tunnels to maintain persistence by establishing covert communication channels that bypass firewalls and intrusion detection systems. These tunnels also facilitate stealthy data exfiltration by encapsulating stolen data within GRE packets, potentially bypassing network monitoring.\nReconnaissance of Myanmar Telecommunications Provider\nIn mid-December 2024, RedMike, from the same infrastructure that exploited the Cisco network devices, performed reconnaissance against multiple infrastructure assets operated by a Myanmar-based telecommunications provider, Mytel, likely including their corporate mail server.\nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.","enclosure":{"url":"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/format_webp/Main_Feature_2_08af644e66.png","length":"0","type":"image/png"},"content":"Discover how Chinese state-sponsored group RedMike exploited unpatched Cisco devices, targeting telecommunications providers globally.

North Korean IT workers infiltrate international companies and secure remote positions under false identities. These operatives not only violate international sanctions but also pose severe cybersecurity threats, engaging in fraud and data theft and potentially disrupting business operations.</p><p>Beyond financial fraud, these IT workers have been linked to cyber espionage. Insikt Group tracks PurpleBravo (formerly Threat Activity Group 120 [TAG-120]), a North Korean-linked cluster that overlaps with the Contagious Interview campaign, which primarily targets software developers in the cryptocurrency industry. The campaign employs malware such as BeaverTail, an infostealer that gathers sensitive information; InvisibleFerret, a cross-platform Python backdoor; and OtterCookie, a tool used to establish persistent access on compromised systems. At least three organizations in the broader cryptocurrency space were targeted by PurpleBravo between October and November 2024: a market-making company, an online casino, and a software development company.</p><p>The findings also highlight North Koreas expansion into other areas of fraud, with the establishment of front companies that mimic legitimate IT firms. TAG-121, a separate cluster of activity, has been identified as operating a network of these companies across China. Each front company spoofs a different legitimate organization by copying large parts of their website. These entities create an added layer of deniability and make detection more challenging, allowing North Korean actors to further embed themselves in global IT supply chains.</p><p>The implications of this threat are far-reaching. Organizations that unknowingly hire North Korean IT workers may be in violation of international sanctions, exposing themselves to legal and financial repercussions. More critically, these workers almost certainly act as insider threats, stealing proprietary information, introducing backdoors, or facilitating larger cyber operations. Given North Koreas history of financial theft, the risks extend beyond individual companies to the broader global financial system and national security interests.</p><p>To mitigate these threats, organizations must adopt stringent identity verification measures, ensuring that remote hires undergo thorough screening. This includes requiring video interviews, notarized identification documents, and continuous monitoring of remote workers for anomalies. Employers should also implement technical controls to detect unauthorized access, restrict data exposure, and flag suspicious remote connections. Awareness and training for human resources (HR) teams and IT security personnel are essential in preventing these actors from infiltrating critical business operations.</p><p>While the threat posed by North Korean IT workers is a fraud issue, it is also a key component of a sophisticated cyber strategy that financially sustains an internationally sanctioned regime. As these operations continue to evolve, businesses, governments, and cybersecurity organizations must work together to close the gaps that enable North Korea to exploit the remote work environment.</p><h2 id=\"key-findings\">Key Findings</h2><ul><li>North Koreas use of IT workers to secure fraudulent employment and execute coordinated cyber campaigns highlights its evolving tactics to fund its military programs while undermining global intellectual property security.</li><li>Insikt Group assesses that PurpleBravo has targeted at least seven entities, three of which are in the cryptocurrency sector, including a market-making firm, an online casino, and a software company.</li><li>Insikt Group found evidence that PurpleBravo uses Astrill VPN to manage its command-and-control (C2) servers. </li><li>PurpleBravo was found posting job advertisements on at least three hiring websites, Telegram, and GitHub.</li><li>Insikt Group identified at least seven suspected North Korean-linked front companies operating in China spoofing legitimate IT firms in China, India, Pakistan, Ukraine, and the United States (US).</li><li>Organizations should implement robust technical safeguards, such as, where feasible, disabling remote desktop software, conducting regular checks of open ports across networks, deploying insider threat monitoring, and geolocating devices.</li><li>Insikt Group expects to continue to see groups like PurpleBravo and TAG-121 exploit the remote work environment, threatening global IT supply chains and intellectual property.</li><li>North Koreas shift toward fraudulent remote employment and front companies will likely outpace traditional hiring protocol checks, driving organizations and governments to adopt more rigorous identity verification, enhanced remote work security, and robust international intelligence-sharing to counter this expanding threat.</li></ul><h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2><p>On January 23, 2025, the US Department of Justice (US DOJ) <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-north-korean-nationals-and-three-facilitators-indicted-multi-year-fraudulent-remote\">indicted</a> two North Korean nationals and three facilitators for remote worker fraud that enriched the North Korean regime. In the indictment, the US DOJ described a six-year scheme in which two US citizens and one Mexican national conspired with North Korean IT workers to remotely work for at least 64 US companies. Payments from ten companies generated at least $866,255 in revenue that was laundered through a Chinese bank account. In addition to the indictment, stories of organizations and individuals that have come across North Korean IT workers can be regularly found in open sources (<a href=\"https://x.com/zachxbt/status/1824047425822310580\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://sohay666.github.io/article/en/reversing-scam-interview-base-on-js-project.html\">2</a>, <a href=\"https://www.knowbe4.com/press/knowbe4-issues-warning-to-organizations-after-hiring-fake-north-korean-employee\">3</a>). Besides sanctions violations, the threat from these workers, whether stealing sensitive data or installing malware on internal systems, presents unique challenges to organizations, especially in remote work environments.</p><p>North Korea remains highly isolated from the outside world due to the regimes strict control over goods, people, and information, as well as international sanctions placed upon the country. Despite this, Pyongyangs leadership is <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/north-korea-internet-activity\">well-versed</a> in exploiting emerging technologies to fund its operations. As sanctions have tightened, the regime <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/north-korea-cyber-activity\">adapted</a> by escalating illicit activities, including smuggling and cybercrime. In recent years, the regime has achieved significant <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/crypto-country-north-koreas-targeting-cryptocurrency\">success</a> in stealing from traditional financial institutions and digital assets like cryptocurrency. Between 2020 and 2024, the rise of remote work created new opportunities for North Korea to deploy skilled IT workers who infiltrate global companies under false identities. Their activities directly support the regimes military programs while posing a significant threat to industries reliant on intellectual property.</p><p>Research into North Korean IT workers has focused on the following aspects of the threat: North Korean IT workers gaining fraudulent <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/mitigating-dprk-it-worker-threat\">employment</a> through proxies; North Korean <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/dprk-it-workers-a-network-of-active-front-companies-and-their-links-to-china/\">front companies</a>, often in the software development space, imitating legitimate organizations; and <a href=\"https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/pyongyang-your-payroll-rise-north-korean-remote-workers-west\">fake</a> employment opportunities targeting software developers in cryptocurrency and AI, among other industries.

The group responsible for this activity is known as CL-STA-0240, Famous Chollima, and Tenacious Pungsan in open sources. Insikt Group has given this cluster of activity the designation PurpleBravo (formerly TAG-120).</p><h4 id=\"purplebravos-fraudulent-profiles\">PurpleBravos Fraudulent Profiles</h4><p>On December 3, 2024, a developer posted a <a href=\"https://sohay666.github.io/article/en/reversing-scam-interview-base-on-js-project.html\">blog</a> about their experience with a suspected PurpleBravo operator. An individual claiming to be a recruiter contacted them about a job offer and then followed up with an interview. During the interview, the interviewer asked the developer to download a coding challenge from a repository. The developer realized there was a malicious function in the file and ended the interview. While the developer does not attribute the malware or actor, Insikt Group assesses with high confidence the file is a BeaverTail infostealer.</p><p>The interviewer used a LinkedIn account with the name Javier Fiesco, who describes themself as the CTO of AgencyHill99. Further investigation into Javier Fiesco <a href=\"https://remote3.co/p/javier0923\">uncovered</a> an individual with the same name available for work on remote3, a Web3 development job board.

BeaverTail is a malware family initially distributed via NPM packages as a JavaScript payload and later as executables and downloaders targeting Windows and macOS environments. BeaverTail also acts as an infostealer, gathering cryptocurrency wallet and browser information. InvisibleFerret is a collection of post-compromise payloads that collectively act as a backdoor in victim environments. InvisibleFerret introduces additional malicious payloads into victim environments, performs information stealing and fingerprinting actions within the victim environment, and leverages legitimate protocols and software for C2 communications. Like InvisibleFerret, OtterCookie is a post-compromise malware family used as a backdoor, which establishes C2 connectivity via Socket[.]IO, receives and executes shell commands from C2 servers, and exfiltrates sensitive victim data.</p><p>Insikt Group analyzed BeaverTail, InvisibleFerret, and OtterCookie malware samples (See <strong>Appendix B</strong> for related file hashes). The BeaverTail samples were identified as PE variants targeting Windows environments. These samples included URLs linked to <em>freeconference[.]com</em>, a legitimate conferencing website, which aligns with Unit42s <a href=\"https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/north-korean-threat-actors-lure-tech-job-seekers-as-fake-recruiters/\">findings</a> of Contagious Interview payloads posing as FreeConference executables. The OtterCookie samples were two separate versions of the malware family; however, static analysis of these samples included strings that demonstrated both samples ability to gather and send system fingerprinting information to attacker C2 servers, including strings that indicated OtterCookie is capable of identifying cryptocurrency assets and sensitive information found in specific file types by using regex patterns, including executables, photos, and config and env files, among others.</p><p>The InvisibleFerret samples analyzed were Python scripts with the following functionalities: </p><ul><li>Determining victim device location via local IP address lookup</li><li>Fingerprinting device details (user and hostname)</li><li>Connecting to a Base64-encoded C2 address via HTTP POST requests</li><li>Performing local directory discovery using hard-coded strings</li><li>Creating a reverse shell for SSH session management and data exfiltration</li><li>Copying clipboard data, keylogging, and tracking mouse movements.</li></ul><p>Previous samples of InvisibleFerret were <a href=\"https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/pyongyang-your-payroll-rise-north-korean-remote-workers-west\">analyzed</a> by Zscaler, which described a two-part infection chain in which the initial reconnaissance took place over HTTP traffic and FTP was used for data exfiltration, as shown in <strong>Figure 2</strong>.</p><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/purplebravo_02_601227dd0c.png\" alt=\"InvisibleFerret\"><em><strong>Figure 2</strong>: InvisibleFerret Infection chain (Source: Recorded Future and <a href=\"https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/pyongyang-your-payroll-rise-north-korean-remote-workers-west\">Zscaler</a>)</em></p><p>Insikt Group identified 21 PurpleBravo servers between August 2024 and February 2025 (see <strong>Appendix B</strong> for the complete list).

North Korean IT workers infiltrate international companies and secure remote positions under false identities. These operatives not only violate international sanctions but also pose severe cybersecurity threats, engaging in fraud and data theft and potentially disrupting business operations.\nBeyond financial fraud, these IT workers have been linked to cyber espionage. Insikt Group tracks PurpleBravo (formerly Threat Activity Group 120 [TAG-120]), a North Korean-linked cluster that overlaps with the Contagious Interview campaign, which primarily targets software developers in the cryptocurrency industry. The campaign employs malware such as BeaverTail, an infostealer that gathers sensitive information; InvisibleFerret, a cross-platform Python backdoor; and OtterCookie, a tool used to establish persistent access on compromised systems. At least three organizations in the broader cryptocurrency space were targeted by PurpleBravo between October and November 2024: a market-making company, an online casino, and a software development company.\nThe findings also highlight North Koreas expansion into other areas of fraud, with the establishment of front companies that mimic legitimate IT firms. TAG-121, a separate cluster of activity, has been identified as operating a network of these companies across China. Each front company spoofs a different legitimate organization by copying large parts of their website. These entities create an added layer of deniability and make detection more challenging, allowing North Korean actors to further embed themselves in global IT supply chains.\nThe implications of this threat are far-reaching. Organizations that unknowingly hire North Korean IT workers may be in violation of international sanctions, exposing themselves to legal and financial repercussions. More critically, these workers almost certainly act as insider threats, stealing proprietary information, introducing backdoors, or facilitating larger cyber operations. Given North Koreas history of financial theft, the risks extend beyond individual companies to the broader global financial system and national security interests.\nTo mitigate these threats, organizations must adopt stringent identity verification measures, ensuring that remote hires undergo thorough screening. This includes requiring video interviews, notarized identification documents, and continuous monitoring of remote workers for anomalies. Employers should also implement technical controls to detect unauthorized access, restrict data exposure, and flag suspicious remote connections. Awareness and training for human resources (HR) teams and IT security personnel are essential in preventing these actors from infiltrating critical business operations.\nWhile the threat posed by North Korean IT workers is a fraud issue, it is also a key component of a sophisticated cyber strategy that financially sustains an internationally sanctioned regime. As these operations continue to evolve, businesses, governments, and cybersecurity organizations must work together to close the gaps that enable North Korea to exploit the remote work environment.\nKey Findings\n\nNorth Koreas use of IT workers to secure fraudulent employment and execute coordinated cyber campaigns highlights its evolving tactics to fund its military programs while undermining global intellectual property security.\nInsikt Group assesses that PurpleBravo has targeted at least seven entities, three of which are in the cryptocurrency sector, including a market-making firm, an online casino, and a software company.\nInsikt Group found evidence that PurpleBravo uses Astrill VPN to manage its command-and-control (C2) servers. \nPurpleBravo was found posting job advertisements on at least three hiring websites, Telegram, and GitHub.\nInsikt Group identified at least seven suspected North Korean-linked front companies operating in China spoofing legitimate IT firms in China, India, Pakistan, Ukraine, and the United States (US).\nOrganizations should implement robust technical safeguards, such as, where feasible, disabling remote desktop software, conducting regular checks of open ports across networks, deploying insider threat monitoring, and geolocating devices.\nInsikt Group expects to continue to see groups like PurpleBravo and TAG-121 exploit the remote work environment, threatening global IT supply chains and intellectual property.\nNorth Koreas shift toward fraudulent remote employment and front companies will likely outpace traditional hiring protocol checks, driving organizations and governments to adopt more rigorous identity verification, enhanced remote work security, and robust international intelligence-sharing to counter this expanding threat.\n\nBackground\nOn January 23, 2025, the US Department of Justice (US DOJ) indicted two North Korean nationals and three facilitators for remote worker fraud that enriched the North Korean regime. In the indictment, the US DOJ described a six-year scheme in which two US citizens and one Mexican national conspired with North Korean IT workers to remotely work for at least 64 US companies. Payments from ten companies generated at least $866,255 in revenue that was laundered through a Chinese bank account. In addition to the indictment, stories of organizations and individuals that have come across North Korean IT workers can be regularly found in open sources (1, 2, 3). Besides sanctions violations, the threat from these workers, whether stealing sensitive data or installing malware on internal systems, presents unique challenges to organizations, especially in remote work environments.\nNorth Korea remains highly isolated from the outside world due to the regimes strict control over goods, people, and information, as well as international sanctions placed upon the country. Despite this, Pyongyangs leadership is well-versed in exploiting emerging technologies to fund its operations. As sanctions have tightened, the regime adapted by escalating illicit activities, including smuggling and cybercrime. In recent years, the regime has achieved significant success in stealing from traditional financial institutions and digital assets like cryptocurrency. Between 2020 and 2024, the rise of remote work created new opportunities for North Korea to deploy skilled IT workers who infiltrate global companies under false identities. Their activities directly support the regimes military programs while posing a significant threat to industries reliant on intellectual property.\nResearch into North Korean IT workers has focused on the following aspects of the threat: North Korean IT workers gaining fraudulent employment through proxies; North Korean front companies, often in the software development space, imitating legitimate organizations; and fake employment opportunities targeting software developers in cryptocurrency and AI, among other industries. Other research has established links between IT workers and ongoing malicious campaigns by North Korean threat actors. \nThreat Analysis\nPurpleBravo\nThe Contagious Interview campaign, first documented in November 2023, targeted software developers primarily in the cryptocurrency space and was attributed to North Korea. The campaign used the JavaScript infostealer BeaverTail, the cross-platform Python backdoor InvisibleFerret, and most recently OtterCookie, a new backdoor identified in December 2024. The group responsible for this activity is known as CL-STA-0240, Famous Chollima, and Tenacious Pungsan in open sources. Insikt Group has given this cluster of activity the designation PurpleBravo (formerly TAG-120).\nPurpleBravos Fraudulent Profiles\nOn December 3, 2024, a developer posted a blog about their experience with a suspected PurpleBravo operator. An individual claiming to be a recruiter contacted them about a job offer and then followed up with an interview. During the interview, the interviewer asked the developer to download a coding challenge from a repository. The developer realized there was a malicious function in the file and ended the interview. While the developer does not attribute the malware or actor, Insikt Group assesses with high confidence the file is a BeaverTail infostealer.\nThe interviewer used a LinkedIn account with the name Javier Fiesco, who describes themself as the CTO of AgencyHill99. Further investigation into Javier Fiesco uncovered an individual with the same name available for work on remote3, a Web3 development job board. The website agencyhill99[.]com was registered on Hostinger on September 13, 2024. As of early February 2025, this website no longer resolved, but it previously displayed a Hostinger landing page. Research into AgencyHill99 uncovered a job posting seeking a developer with blockchain knowledge on levels[.]fyi, with the following contact info:\n\nContact us: alexander@agencyhill99[.]com\nRecruiter: vision.founder1004@gmail[.]com\n\nPivoting on the text in the job description returned two private job postings on Upwork (1, 2). Additionally, a profile with the name of Lucifer, and what appears to be an AI-generated headshot, who works for AgencyHill99 was observed on the website DoraHacks, which is a hackathon, bounty, and grant organization. The profile on DoraHacks states that AgencyHill99 is looking to hire a developer. Insikt Group also discovered a company with the name Agencyhill99 on the website Intch, a part-time and remote job platform. The company posted a Part-Time IT Developer Opportunity by an individual with the name Newton Curtis, who is a recruiter at AgencyHill99.\nFigure 1: PurpleBravo operators account on DoraHacks (Source: DoraHacks)\nInsikt Group found several posts in Telegram channels from individuals with @agencyhill99[.]com email addresses advertising jobs. Below is a summary of the posts:\n\nOn September 16, 2024, an account with the username Dale_V and email address ayat@agencyhill99[.]com posted in the Telegram channel freelancerclients that they were looking to hire a developer.\nOn September 26, 2024, an account with the username jaxtonhol and email address ysai@agencyhill99[.]com posted in the Telegram channel indeedemploijobeur that they were looking to hire a developer. On the same day, the account Dale_V using the email ysai@agencyhill99[.]com posted in the Telegram channel cryptolux_b that they were looking to hire a blockchain developer. They posted the same message in the itkita, andexzuxiaomichat, and usvacancy channels. On September 27, 2024, Dale_V posted the same message in the crypto_brazil and cryptolux_br channels.\nOn October 2, 2024, Dale_V posted the same message with a new email address, sam@agencyhill99[.]com, in the fortifiedx_chat, family_indonesia_uae_ph, cryptolux_br, and freelancerclients channels.\nOn October 3, 2024, a user in an Indonesian-language Telegram channel posted a screenshot of an email message they received from PurpleBravo operators. \nOn October 9, 2024, Dale_V posted job advertisements in the andexzuxiaomichat, family_indonesia_uae_ph, cryptolux_br, crypto_brazil, and freelancerclients channels.\nOn October 22, 2024, Dale_V posted in the Telegram channel hiringofm seeking individuals to help maintain a game called Destiny War, and added the X link, hxxps://twitter[.]com/destinywarnft. It is unclear if the actor controls this X account or game.\nOn November 13, 2024, the Telegram user jaxtonhol posted in the Telegram channel near_jobs seeking blockchain engineers. The same user posted again on December 7, 2024, in the same channel with the email address ysai@agencyhill99[.]com.\nOn November 30, 2024, a Telegram user posted asking if a job offer on LinkedIn from the account mentioned above, Javier Feisco associated with Agencyhill99, was legitimate and shared a screenshot of the message.\n\nGitHub Repository\nInsikt Group discovered a GitHub repository named agencyhill99 with the email address admin@agencyhill99[.]com. A GitHub user, dev-astro-star, made several commits to the repository between October 9 and 19, 2024. Based on the commits, it appears the website used Firebase, a Google backend service for web applications. The user added a button to download a file at the Google Drive link https://drive.google[.]com/uc?id=166zcmpqj-C7NPltm4iwRolz8XuxqZIXt, which is no longer accessible. The email address admin@agencyhill99[.]com was also added to the repository, along with the Telegram channel hxxps://t[.]me/+2AurfGZWxZo0MDgx, which is also no longer live. The user also added a download link to hxxp://65.108.20[.]73/BattleTank[.]exe, which is no longer live and was later updated to hxxp://65.108.20[.]73[:]3000/BattleTank[.]exe. Port 3000 was open from October 20, 2024, to November 22, 2024, on 65.108.20[.]73. The link was then updated to hxxp://locahost[:]3000/BattleTank[.]rar.\nPurpleBravo Malware and Infrastructure\nPurpleBravo uses the malware families BeaverTail, InvisibleFerret, and OtterCookie. BeaverTail is a malware family initially distributed via NPM packages as a JavaScript payload and later as executables and downloaders targeting Windows and macOS environments. BeaverTail also acts as an infostealer, gathering cryptocurrency wallet and browser information. InvisibleFerret is a collection of post-compromise payloads that collectively act as a backdoor in victim environments. InvisibleFerret introduces additional malicious payloads into victim environments, performs information stealing and fingerprinting actions within the victim environment, and leverages legitimate protocols and software for C2 communications. Like InvisibleFerret, OtterCookie is a post-compromise malware family used as a backdoor, which establishes C2 connectivity via Socket[.]IO, receives and executes shell commands from C2 servers, and exfiltrates sensitive victim data.\nInsikt Group analyzed BeaverTail, InvisibleFerret, and OtterCookie malware samples (See Appendix B for related file hashes). The BeaverTail samples were identified as PE variants targeting Windows environments. These samples included URLs linked to freeconference[.]com, a legitimate conferencing website, which aligns with Unit42s findings of Contagious Interview payloads posing as FreeConference executables. The OtterCookie samples were two separate versions of the malware family; however, static analysis of these samples included strings that demonstrated both samples ability to gather and send system fingerprinting information to attacker C2 servers, including strings that indicated OtterCookie is capable of identifying cryptocurrency assets and sensitive information found in specific file types by using regex patterns, including executables, photos, and config and env files, among others.\nThe InvisibleFerret samples analyzed were Python scripts with the following functionalities: \n\nDetermining victim device location via local IP address lookup\nFingerprinting device details (user and hostname)\nConnecting to a Base64-encoded C2 address via HTTP POST requests\nPerforming local directory discovery using hard-coded strings\nCreating a reverse shell for SSH session management and data exfiltration\nCopying clipboard data, keylogging, and tracking mouse movements.\n\nPrevious samples of InvisibleFerret were analyzed by Zscaler, which described a two-part infection chain in which the initial reconnaissance took place over HTTP traffic and FTP was used for data exfiltration, as shown in Figure 2.\nFigure 2: InvisibleFerret Infection chain (Source: Recorded Future and Zscaler)\nInsikt Group identified 21 PurpleBravo servers between August 2024 and February 2025 (see Appendix B for the complete list). The majority of servers use Tier[.]Net hosting, with Majestic Hosting, Stark Industries, Leaseweb Singapore, and Kaopu Cloud HK also being used in this campaign. Insikt Group has previously observed other North Korean threat groups favor many of these hosting providers. In addition to the C2 servers, using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group observed at least seven suspected victims between September 2024 and February 13, 2025. The victims are located in at least six countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Costa Rica, India, Vietnam, Trkiye, and South Korea. Open-source research identified Astrill VPN as a favored service by North Korean IT workers, with evidence that they use the service with remote administration tools. Insikt Group also observed network traffic between known Astrill VPN endpoints and PurpleBravo servers, corroborating this connection.\nFigure 3: Location of PurpleBravo victims (Source: Recorded Future)\nAt least three victims in the cryptocurrency space were identified in the findings summarized below:\n\nOn October 3, 2024, Insikt Group observed likely reconnaissance traffic between a BeaverTail C2 and a market-making company in the cryptocurrency space based in the United Arab Emirates. Shortly after the reconnaissance traffic, we observed likely exfiltration FTP traffic between the same IP addresses.\nOn October 15, 2024, Insikt Group observed likely reconnaissance traffic between a BeaverTail C2 and a gambling company that offers online games and sells slot machines in the cryptocurrency space. The company is registered in Costa Rica. Reconnaissance traffic followed by FTP exfiltration traffic was observed between the C2 and the company's infrastructure on November 25 and 26, 2024.\nOn October 2, 2024, Insikt Group observed potential FTP exfiltration traffic between a BeaverTail C2 and a software development company based in India that builds blockchain, AI, and mobile, among other applications.\n\nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.","enclosure":{"url":"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/format_webp/Main_Feature_1_dd9f012ba7.png","length":"0","type":"image/png"},"content":"Learn how North Korea’s IT workers infiltrate global companies, posing cybersecurity threats, committing fraud, and supporting the regime.

While an invasion in the short term (20252026) is currently unlikely, the factors informing Insikt Groups assessment are rapidly evolving. Beginning in 2027 and continuing through the long term (20272049), the risk of an invasion will very likely continue to increase, though it is not inevitable that an invasion will occur. In the short term, China is almost certain to continue its current coercive efforts, including major military exercises and incursions into maritime and air spaces near Taiwan, while seeking ways to incrementally escalate such coercion below the level of an invasion. In these efforts, China is likely to initiate a temporary law enforcement-led quarantine and a disruptive cyber campaign against Taiwans critical infrastructure.</p><p>Our assessment is based on a range of behaviors and trends across China, Taiwan, and the United States (US), as described in the <strong>Key Findings</strong> below, and in consideration of Chinas broader geopolitical context (see <strong>Appendix A</strong>). Fundamentally, in the short term, we assess that  absent a specific catalyst that leads to war (such as if Taiwan were to declare formal independence)   the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership is very likely to remain focused on improving domestic conditions and strengthening preparations for navigating tensions with the US, a potential invasion of Taiwan, or other conflict with foreign powers (such as over the South China Sea). In the long term, we assess that China will likely have established a level of preparedness across the military, economic, social, and other domains by 2027 that would enable its leadership to invade Taiwan as a war of choice (rather than in response to a specific catalyst) while minimizing associated costs and risks. </p><p>Our assessment is generally aligned with public statements by Taiwan and US government and military officials since the start of 2023, both of which emphasize active preparations regardless of speculation about specific timelines. More specifically, Taiwan officials express that an invasion is currently unlikely despite the potential for a diversionary war to distract from Chinas domestic economic challenges. They also highlight weaknesses in the Peoples Liberation Armys (PLAs) amphibious capability while recognizing the PLA could likely execute a blockade of Taiwan  the foremost alternative to an invasion. US officials express that an invasion is not imminent or inevitable, but that the risk is increasing and that Chinas forces are on track to meet their modernization and readiness goals. </p><p>An invasion would almost certainly severely impact the global economy, disrupting critical shipping lanes, devastating the semiconductor industry, and imposing broad costs on Taiwan, China, and potentially the US. Businesses likely to be affected by a Taiwan invasion scenario should consider taking steps such as building relationships with potential alternative suppliers outside of Asia, evaluating the purchase of war risk insurance, conducting scenario-based stress tests to identify vulnerabilities in operations and investments, maintaining encrypted offline backups of key computer systems and data, isolating high-value computer systems to limit an adversarys lateral movement in case of a breach, and purchasing a geopolitical threat intelligence capability to support ongoing monitoring of the Taiwan issue (additional recommendations can be found in the <strong>Preparing for Potential Global Economic Disruption</strong> section of this report). Indicators of escalation to support monitoring are provided in <strong>Appendix B</strong>. Given the public focus on the impact of an invasion on Taiwans semiconductor industry, <strong>Appendix C</strong> further offers our assessment of why that industry is not especially relevant to judging if or when China might invade.</p><h2 id=\"key-findings\">Key Findings</h2><p>Assessments supporting our judgment that an invasion is unlikely in the short term include:</p><p>China almost certainly continues to prefer peaceful reunification and very likely continues to invest in a dual-track strategy that combines economic inducements with coercive elements.Chinas economy is facing challenges that are very likely holding the focus of leadership as they strive to attain national rejuvenation. Despite PLA progress in developing capabilities necessary for a successful invasion of Taiwan, Chinas military continues to have limitations in areas that suggest it is not yet ready to undertake an invasion.Chinas leadership has likely not begun telling the public to prepare for war and public support for a war is likely not at levels the CCP would prefer before ordering an invasion. Although long-term public opinion trends in Taiwan are unfavorable to Chinas goals, polling results since 2020 likely suggest to Chinas leadership that its strategy is working to curb preferences for independence in the short term.</p><p>Assessments supporting our judgment of rising risk in the long term include:</p><p>The CCP has become increasingly assertive and very likely expectant of progress with regard to its goals for Taiwan.Under Xi Jinpings leadership, the CCP has taken administrative and other measures to develop a self-sufficient economy, harden against foreign economic coercion such as sanctions, decrease reliance on the US dollar, and prepare for shortages in strategic resources like grain and critical minerals.China-based cyber threat actors are targeting US critical infrastructure in ways that suggest their goal is to pre-position for a potential conflict. Chinas leadership has intensified its use of lawfare measures against Taiwan, particularly over the past year. The PLA, Chinas wider armed forces, and Chinas defense industry are continuing to improve capabilities that would be needed for a successful invasion of Taiwan, countering US intervention, and other scenarios.The political and social environments in Taiwan are both trending toward potentially permanent rejection of unification.Chinas leadership almost certainly perceives US government behavior as trending toward overturning its (the USs) one-China policy, which is one of Beijings likely red lines that could hasten an invasion scenario.</p><h2 id=\"indicators-an-invasion-is-unlikely-in-the-short-term\">Indicators an Invasion Is Unlikely in the Short Term</h2><p>There are several elements of Chinas behavior that support our assessment that a Taiwan invasion is unlikely before 2027. These include Chinas almost certain continuing preference for peaceful reunification, indicators that it very likely continues to pursue a dual-track approach to Taiwan, economic challenges that very likely take priority given Chinas other ambitions, shortfalls in PLA capability, and limited indication that China has begun mobilizing its populace to brace for wartime hardship. Additionally, public opinion polling results in Taiwan since 2020 likely suggest to Chinas leadership that its coercive strategy is working to deter independence in the short term. In totality, we assess that  absent a specific catalyst that leads to war (such as if Taiwan declares formal independence or China assesses foreign military interference in Taiwan)   the CCP leadership is very likely, in the short term, to remain focused on improving domestic conditions and strengthening preparations for navigating tensions with the US, a potential invasion, or other conflict with a foreign power (for example, over the South China Sea).</p><h3 id=\"trends-in-china\">Trends in China</h3><p>China almost certainly continues to prefer peaceful reunification and very likely continues to invest in a dual-track strategy that combines economic inducements with coercive elements.

While an invasion in the short term (20252026) is currently unlikely, the factors informing Insikt Groups assessment are rapidly evolving. Beginning in 2027 and continuing through the long term (20272049), the risk of an invasion will very likely continue to increase, though it is not inevitable that an invasion will occur. In the short term, China is almost certain to continue its current coercive efforts, including major military exercises and incursions into maritime and air spaces near Taiwan, while seeking ways to incrementally escalate such coercion below the level of an invasion. In these efforts, China is likely to initiate a temporary law enforcement-led quarantine and a disruptive cyber campaign against Taiwans critical infrastructure.\nOur assessment is based on a range of behaviors and trends across China, Taiwan, and the United States (US), as described in the Key Findings below, and in consideration of Chinas broader geopolitical context (see Appendix A). Fundamentally, in the short term, we assess that  absent a specific catalyst that leads to war (such as if Taiwan were to declare formal independence)   the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership is very likely to remain focused on improving domestic conditions and strengthening preparations for navigating tensions with the US, a potential invasion of Taiwan, or other conflict with foreign powers (such as over the South China Sea). In the long term, we assess that China will likely have established a level of preparedness across the military, economic, social, and other domains by 2027 that would enable its leadership to invade Taiwan as a war of choice (rather than in response to a specific catalyst) while minimizing associated costs and risks. \nOur assessment is generally aligned with public statements by Taiwan and US government and military officials since the start of 2023, both of which emphasize active preparations regardless of speculation about specific timelines. More specifically, Taiwan officials express that an invasion is currently unlikely despite the potential for a diversionary war to distract from Chinas domestic economic challenges. They also highlight weaknesses in the Peoples Liberation Armys (PLAs) amphibious capability while recognizing the PLA could likely execute a blockade of Taiwan  the foremost alternative to an invasion. US officials express that an invasion is not imminent or inevitable, but that the risk is increasing and that Chinas forces are on track to meet their modernization and readiness goals. \nAn invasion would almost certainly severely impact the global economy, disrupting critical shipping lanes, devastating the semiconductor industry, and imposing broad costs on Taiwan, China, and potentially the US. Businesses likely to be affected by a Taiwan invasion scenario should consider taking steps such as building relationships with potential alternative suppliers outside of Asia, evaluating the purchase of war risk insurance, conducting scenario-based stress tests to identify vulnerabilities in operations and investments, maintaining encrypted offline backups of key computer systems and data, isolating high-value computer systems to limit an adversarys lateral movement in case of a breach, and purchasing a geopolitical threat intelligence capability to support ongoing monitoring of the Taiwan issue (additional recommendations can be found in the Preparing for Potential Global Economic Disruption section of this report). Indicators of escalation to support monitoring are provided in Appendix B. Given the public focus on the impact of an invasion on Taiwans semiconductor industry, Appendix C further offers our assessment of why that industry is not especially relevant to judging if or when China might invade.\nKey Findings\nAssessments supporting our judgment that an invasion is unlikely in the short term include:\nChina almost certainly continues to prefer peaceful reunification and very likely continues to invest in a dual-track strategy that combines economic inducements with coercive elements.Chinas economy is facing challenges that are very likely holding the focus of leadership as they strive to attain national rejuvenation. Despite PLA progress in developing capabilities necessary for a successful invasion of Taiwan, Chinas military continues to have limitations in areas that suggest it is not yet ready to undertake an invasion.Chinas leadership has likely not begun telling the public to prepare for war and public support for a war is likely not at levels the CCP would prefer before ordering an invasion. Although long-term public opinion trends in Taiwan are unfavorable to Chinas goals, polling results since 2020 likely suggest to Chinas leadership that its strategy is working to curb preferences for independence in the short term.\nAssessments supporting our judgment of rising risk in the long term include:\nThe CCP has become increasingly assertive and very likely expectant of progress with regard to its goals for Taiwan.Under Xi Jinpings leadership, the CCP has taken administrative and other measures to develop a self-sufficient economy, harden against foreign economic coercion such as sanctions, decrease reliance on the US dollar, and prepare for shortages in strategic resources like grain and critical minerals.China-based cyber threat actors are targeting US critical infrastructure in ways that suggest their goal is to pre-position for a potential conflict. Chinas leadership has intensified its use of lawfare measures against Taiwan, particularly over the past year. The PLA, Chinas wider armed forces, and Chinas defense industry are continuing to improve capabilities that would be needed for a successful invasion of Taiwan, countering US intervention, and other scenarios.The political and social environments in Taiwan are both trending toward potentially permanent rejection of unification.Chinas leadership almost certainly perceives US government behavior as trending toward overturning its (the USs) one-China policy, which is one of Beijings likely red lines that could hasten an invasion scenario.\nIndicators an Invasion Is Unlikely in the Short Term\nThere are several elements of Chinas behavior that support our assessment that a Taiwan invasion is unlikely before 2027. These include Chinas almost certain continuing preference for peaceful reunification, indicators that it very likely continues to pursue a dual-track approach to Taiwan, economic challenges that very likely take priority given Chinas other ambitions, shortfalls in PLA capability, and limited indication that China has begun mobilizing its populace to brace for wartime hardship. Additionally, public opinion polling results in Taiwan since 2020 likely suggest to Chinas leadership that its coercive strategy is working to deter independence in the short term. In totality, we assess that  absent a specific catalyst that leads to war (such as if Taiwan declares formal independence or China assesses foreign military interference in Taiwan)   the CCP leadership is very likely, in the short term, to remain focused on improving domestic conditions and strengthening preparations for navigating tensions with the US, a potential invasion, or other conflict with a foreign power (for example, over the South China Sea).\nTrends in China\nChina almost certainly continues to prefer peaceful reunification and very likely continues to invest in a dual-track strategy that combines economic inducements with coercive elements. While the coercive elements of the CCPs strategy  including large-scale military exercises (reportedly with cyber components), air defense identification zone (ADIZ) incursions, and expanding law enforcement patrols around Taiwans outlying islands  receive the most attention, examples of the other side of CCP strategy include the following: a June 2024 plan to deepen cross-strait innovation and development cooperation in Dongguan city, January 2024 reforms in Fujian that created new government offices for Taiwan work, and a September 2023 plan to build a cross-strait integrated development demonstration zone in Fujian province, and 68 other preferential policies and measures targeting Taiwan businesses in China between 2018 and 2020. Xi Jinpings activities in October 2024 also very likely signal this dual-track approach, omitting references to peace in statements relevant to Taiwan and visiting locations significant to Chinas civil war history while also calling for greater integrated development. On January 15, 2025, a spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office reiterated that integrated development is a focal point for the coming year. Additionally, there is almost certainly still no strict deadline for achieving unification.\nChinas economy is in a period of transition, volatility, and struggle, facing challenges that are very likely holding the focus of leadership as it strives to attain national rejuvenation and continue preparing for potential armed conflict. Chinas challenges include a depressed property market, deflation, high local government debt, declining foreign investment, elevated youth unemployment, and lingering dependence on critical foreign technology like semiconductor production tools (for more on the relevance of semiconductors in Chinas likely Taiwan invasion calculus, see Appendix C), while shifting toward a green, high-tech structure. These and other challenges have led to arguments that China could invade Taiwan to distract from domestic troubles (1, 2, 3, 4), but this is unlikely. First, diversionary war has not been the CCPs method for managing domestic crises since 1949. Second, the economic challenges are likely not great enough to derail the PLAs ongoing modernization in ways that would limit Chinas option to use force in the future. During this period, Xi Jinping is very likely to focus on solving domestic economic problems while strengthening the military to support conditions for achieving national rejuvenation by 2049  a goal with an economic component  and to prepare for unifying with Taiwan through force if doing so is deemed necessary. \nDespite PLA progress toward developing capabilities necessary for a successful invasion of Taiwan (discussed further below), Chinas military continues to have limitations in areas that suggest it is not yet ready to undertake such a high-risk operation. These limitations very likely include a lack of sealift capacity for an invasion of Taiwan, inadequate rapid runway repair capabilities to restore air operations following enemy assaults, difficulty integrating submarine forces into joint operations, and helicopter forces that have readiness and operational capacity limitations. Corruption also continues to be a major challenge for the PLA and Chinas defense industry, potentially disrupting the militarys organizational command, the quality of its personnel, its preparedness for warfare, and the attainment of its modernization goals. \nChinas leadership has likely not begun telling the public to prepare for war and public support for a war is likely not at levels the CCP would prefer before ordering an invasion. This point is debated, with some analysts focusing on Xi Jinpings warning that the stormy seas of a major test are looming, his emphasis on worst-case scenario thinking, and the CCPs escalating rhetoric targeting Taiwan.

These websites appear to lack a consistent theme regarding industry, topic, or geography, suggesting they were likely compromised opportunistically through exploits or by acquiring credentials, such as those obtained via infostealers. </p><h5 id=\"first-stage-wordpress-websites-in-initial-delivery\">First-Stage WordPress Websites in Initial Delivery</h5><p>The compromised websites of the first stage in the initial delivery phase typically include a script tag with an async attribute at an arbitrary location in the document object model (DOM), enabling the loading of an external JavaScript file in parallel with the page to avoid rendering delays (see <strong>Figure 2</strong>).</p><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/tag_124_002_34e39e0a75.png\" alt=\"Script tag in DOM used to load external JavaScript file\"><em><strong>Figure 2</strong>: Script tag in DOM used to load external JavaScript file (Source: <a href=\"https://urlscan.io/result/eaa33803-1435-44c9-949f-3d707f51da4a\">URLScan</a>)</em></p><p>The JavaScript filename has changed frequently over time, with earlier names following recognizable patterns (such as <span style=\"font-family: Courier;\">metrics.js</span>) and more recent ones <a href=\"https://threatfox.abuse.ch/ioc/1353344/\">appearing</a> to be randomly formatted (such as <span style=\"font-family: Courier;\">hpms1989.js</span>).

For instance, the website associated with <em>www[.]ecowas[.]int</em> has consistently changed the URL used to fetch the JavaScript file. This behavior indicates that the threat actors maintain ongoing access to these WordPress sites and frequently alter the URLs, including the domain and JavaScript filename, likely to evade detection.</p><p>Although many of the compromised WordPress websites appear to be associated with lesser-known organizations, Insikt Group identified notable cases, including a subdomain linked to the Polish Centre for Testing and Certification, <em>www[.]pcbc[.]gov[.]pl</em>, and the domain of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) (<em>www[.]ecowas[.]int</em>). Both have been compromised and used in TAG-124 campaigns.</p><h5 id=\"final-stage-wordpress-websites-in-initial-delivery\">Final Stage WordPress Websites in Initial Delivery</h5><p>If visitors meet specific criteria, which could not be fully determined, the compromised WordPress domains typically present fake Google Chrome update landing pages.

Of note, two domains hosted on <em>45[.]61[.]136[.]67</em>, namely <em>piedsmontlaw[.]com</em> and <em>pemalite[.]com</em>, were already resolving to this IP address in 2022, indicating that the server may have already been under the control of the threat actor during that time.</p><h5 id=\"suspected-higher-tier-infrastructure\">Suspected Higher-Tier Infrastructure</h5><p>The majority of the suspected threat actor-controlled TAG-124 delivery servers, as listed in the TAG-124 Delivery Servers section, have been seen communicating with a server over TCP port 443 (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>). The configurations of this server are similar to those of the delivery servers and host a domain that returns only a generic HTML page when accessed. At the time of analysis, Insikt Group could not determine the exact purpose of this server but suspects it plays a central role in the operation. One possibility is that it contains the core logic of the TDS.</p><p>Additionally, Insikt Group identified a suspected management server linked to TAG-124. This server has been observed communicating with the delivery servers via TCP ports 80 and 443. It has also interacted with another panel linked to TAG-124, referred to as the &quot;Ads Panel&quot;, whose purpose includes serving the latest delivery server through a specified endpoint, among others (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>).</p><h2>Appendix A  Indicators of Compromise</h2><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"font-family:Courier New;background-color:#fff\"><strong>Likely Compromised

2025\nExecutive Summary\nInsikt Group has identified multi-layered infrastructure linked to a traffic distribution system (TDS) tracked by Recorded Future as TAG-124, which overlaps with threat activity clusters known as LandUpdate808, 404TDS, KongTuke, and Chaya_002. TAG-124 comprises a network of compromised WordPress sites, actor-controlled payload servers, a central server, a suspected management server, an additional panel, and other components. The threat actors behind TAG-124 demonstrate high levels of activity, including regularly updating URLs embedded in the compromised WordPress sites, adding servers, refining TDS logic to evade detection, and adapting infection tactics, as demonstrated by their recent implementation of the ClickFix technique. \nInsikt Group identified multiple threat actors using TAG-124 within their initial infection chains, including operators of Rhysida ransomware, Interlock ransomware, TA866/Asylum Ambuscade, SocGholish, D3F@CK Loader, TA582, and others. Notably, the shared use of TAG-124 reinforces the connection between Rhysida and Interlock ransomware, which are already linked through similarities in tactics, tools, encryption behaviors, ransom note themes, code overlaps, and data exfiltration techniques. Insikt Group expects that TAG-124 will continue its operations within the increasingly sophisticated and specialized cybercriminal ecosystem, enhance its effectiveness, and attract additional users and partners.\nKey Findings\n\nInsikt Group identified multi-layered infrastructure linked to a TDS tracked as TAG-124. This infrastructure includes a network of compromised WordPress sites, likely actor-controlled payload servers, a central server, a suspected management server, and an additional panel, among other components.\nThe threat actor(s) associated with TAG-124 appear highly active, regularly updating URLs on compromised WordPress sites to evade detection, adding new servers to their infrastructure, and improving TDS-linked conditional logic and infection tactics. \nMultiple threat actors are assessed to incorporate TAG-124s service into their initial infection chains, including operators of Rhysida ransomware, Interlock ransomware, TA866/Asylum Ambuscade, SocGholish, D3F@CK Loader, TA582, and others.\nWhile Rhysida and Interlock ransomware have been associated with each other due to similarities in tactics, tools, encryption behaviors, ransom note themes, overlaps in code, and data exfiltration techniques, the shared use of TAG-124 reinforces this connection.\n\nBackground\nTAG-124, which overlaps with LandUpdate808, 404TDS, KongTuke, and Chaya_002, is a TDS used to distribute malware on behalf of various threat actors, including operators of Rhysida ransomware, Interlock ransomware, TA866/Asylum Ambuscade, SocGholish, D3F@CK Loader, and TA582, among others (1, 2, 3). A TDS typically refers to a system used to analyze and redirect web traffic based on parameters like geolocation or device type, funneling only specific visitors to malicious destinations such as phishing sites, malware, or exploit kits, while evading detection and optimizing cybercriminal campaigns. \nMore specifically, TAG-124 operates by injecting malicious JavaScript code into compromised WordPress websites. When visitors access an infected website, they unknowingly load attacker-controlled resources designed to manipulate them into completing actions that result in the download and execution of malware. TAG-124 often deceives victims by presenting the malware as a required Google Chrome browser update. \nIn more recent variations, TAG-124 has been observed using the ClickFix technique. This approach displays a dialog instructing visitors to execute a command pre-copied to their clipboard. Once a visitor runs the command, it initiates a multi-stage process that downloads and executes the malware payload.\nThreat Analysis\nTAG-124\nInsikt Group identified multi-layered infrastructure associated with the TDS TAG-124. This infrastructure comprises a network of compromised WordPress sites, likely actor-controlled payload servers, a central server whose exact purpose remains unclear at the time of analysis, a suspected management server, and an additional management panel. If visitors fulfill specific criteria, the compromised WordPress websites display fake Google Chrome update landing pages, which ultimately lead to malware infections as discussed in the Users of TAG-124 section of this report (see Figure 1).\nFigure 1: TAG-124s high-level infrastructure setup (Source: Recorded Future)\nCompromised WordPress Websites\nTAG-124s infrastructure consists of an extensive network of WordPress websites (see Appendix A). These websites appear to lack a consistent theme regarding industry, topic, or geography, suggesting they were likely compromised opportunistically through exploits or by acquiring credentials, such as those obtained via infostealers. \nFirst-Stage WordPress Websites in Initial Delivery\nThe compromised websites of the first stage in the initial delivery phase typically include a script tag with an async attribute at an arbitrary location in the document object model (DOM), enabling the loading of an external JavaScript file in parallel with the page to avoid rendering delays (see Figure 2).\nFigure 2: Script tag in DOM used to load external JavaScript file (Source: URLScan)\nThe JavaScript filename has changed frequently over time, with earlier names following recognizable patterns (such as metrics.js) and more recent ones appearing to be randomly formatted (such as hpms1989.js). Example filenames include:\n\n3561.js\n365h.js\ne365r.js\nhpms1989.js\nmetrics.js\nnazvanie.js\nweb-analyzer.js\nweb-metrics.js\nweb.js\nwp-config.js\nwp.js\n\nNotably, the threat actors appear to be regularly updating the URLs on the compromised websites. For instance, the website associated with www[.]ecowas[.]int has consistently changed the URL used to fetch the JavaScript file. This behavior indicates that the threat actors maintain ongoing access to these WordPress sites and frequently alter the URLs, including the domain and JavaScript filename, likely to evade detection.\nAlthough many of the compromised WordPress websites appear to be associated with lesser-known organizations, Insikt Group identified notable cases, including a subdomain linked to the Polish Centre for Testing and Certification, www[.]pcbc[.]gov[.]pl, and the domain of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) (www[.]ecowas[.]int). Both have been compromised and used in TAG-124 campaigns.\nFinal Stage WordPress Websites in Initial Delivery\nIf visitors meet specific criteria, which could not be fully determined, the compromised WordPress domains typically present fake Google Chrome update landing pages. These pages prompt users to click a download button, triggering the download of the actual payload from designated endpoints on a secondary set of compromised WordPress websites, including but likely not limited to:\n\n/wp-admin/images/wfgth.php\n/wp-includes/pomo/update.php\n/wp-content/upgrade/update.php\n/wp-admin/images/rsggj.php\n\nFake Google Chrome Update Landing Pages\nInsikt Group discovered two variants of fake Google Chrome update landing pages associated with TAG-124 (see Figure 3). According to URLScan submission data, Variant 1 has been active longer, with its earliest submission recorded on April 24, 2024.\nFigure 3: Fake Google Chrome update variant 1 (left) and 2 (right) (Source: URLScan, URLScan)\nOnly victims meeting a specific set of still unknown conditions are directed to the fake Google Chrome update landing page, resulting in the observation of only a limited number of domains (see Table 1). These domains can be attributed to TAG-124 based on the URLs embedded in the DOM, public reporting, or other indicators. Notably, the threat actors consistently misspell the word referer as refferer in the query parameter, a typographical error observed in earlier reports.\n\nDomainNotesVariant\nwww[.]reloadinternet[.]comLinked towww[.]netzwerkreklame[.]de1\nselectmotors[.]netLinked towww[.]netzwerkreklame[.]de1\nmgssoft[.]comLinked towww[.]netzwerkreklame[.]de1\nwww[.]lovebscott[.]comLinked tosustaincharlotte[.]org1\nevolverangesolutions[.]comLinked tosustaincharlotte[.]org1\nwww[.]ecowas[.]intLinked towww[.]pawrestling[.]net1\nns1[.]webasatir[.]irLinkedtotrue-blood[.]net, which has been previously associated with TAG-1242\navayehazar[.]irLinked totrue-blood[.]net2\ncvqrcode[.]lpmglobalrelations[.]comLinked totrue-blood[.]net2\nmktgads[.]comLinked totrue-blood[.]net2\nincalzireivar[.]roLinked totrue-blood[.]net2\ngmdva[.]orgLinked totrue-blood[.]net2\nwww[.]de[.]digitaalkantoor[.]onlineLinked totrue-blood[.]net2\nelamoto[.]comLinkedto TAG-124 and has the typographical error in the query parameter; it was redirected fromwinworld[.]es, a domain associated with Spain-based WinWorld, a company specializing in computer support and services2\n\nTable 1: Likely compromised websites hosting fake Google Chrome update pages (Source: Recorded Future)\nLikely Threat Actor-Owned Domain\nWhile the domains listed in Table 1 are likely compromised, Insikt Group analyzed URLs present on websites hosted on two additional domains (see Table 2). Our analysis suggests these domains are highly likely connected to TAG-124.\n\nDomainNotesVariant\nupdate-chronne[.]comContainedlink totrue-blood[.]net1\nsollishealth[.]comContainedlinks toedveha[.]comandespumadesign[.]com; both were previously associated with TAG-1242\n\nTable 2: Additional domains found via visual similarity search (Source: Recorded Future)\nThe domain update-chronne[.]com, hosted behind Cloudflare, appears to be owned by the threat actors as it directly impersonates Google Chrome (see Figure 4). At the time of analysis, the domain was still active, indexed by Google Search, and hosted the file Release.zip, which was identified as REMCOS RAT.\nFigure 4: Google Chrome fake update landing page on update-chronne[.]com (Source: Recorded Future)\nNotably, when a victim clicks the Update Chrome button, the website redirects to downloading[.]bplnetempresas[.]com, which shows the IP address 146.70.41[.]191 combined with three different ports (see Figure 5). This IP address has previously been associated with REMCOS RAT. \nFigure 5: Suspected REMCOS RAT command-and-control (C2) server shown on downloading[.]bplnetempresas[.]com (Source: Recorded Future)\nAdditionally, the domain hosted a file named moc.txt, containing a PowerShell script designed to download and execute the contents of Release.zip (see Figure 6). The URL was redirected via the shortened URL https://wl[.]gl/25dW64.\nFigure 6: PowerShell script hosted on https://update-chronne[.]com/moc.txt as of September 12, 2024 (Source: URLScan)\nSuspected Shell Website\nBoth update-chronne[.]com and downloading[.]bplnetempresas[.]com hosted a website seemingly associated with \"YSOFEL\", which appears to be a Brazilian organization (see Figure 7). However, no information about this organization could be found online, indicating that it is likely a fictitious entity.\nFigure 7: Suspected shell website linked to a fake Brazilian organization (Source: URLScan)\nInsikt Group identified several other domains, some of which are noted in the Compromised WordPress Websites section (such as mktgads[.]com), while others appear to impersonate Google (such as check-googlle[.]com) (see Table 3). This suggests that the website may function as a \"shell website\", potentially used to age domains or to display content only when visitors meet specific criteria.\n\nDomainIP AddressFirst SeenLast SeenNotes\nchallinksch[.]comCloudflare2024-09-052025-01-05Hosted PowerShell script to download PuTTY and linked to AsyncRAT\nchalnlizt[.]orgCloudflare2024-08-212025-01-07Hosted PowerShell script\ncheck-googlle[.]comCloudflare2024-09-092025-01-07N/A\ncihainlst[.]orgCloudflare2024-08-212025-01-07N/A\nio-suite-web[.]comCloudflare2024-08-142025-01-07N/A\nminer-tolken[.]comCloudflare2024-09-062025-01-07N/A\nronnin-v2[.]comCloudflare2024-05-272025-01-07N/A\nsymdilatic[.]comCloudflare2024-08-202025-01-07N/A\nsymbieitc[.]comCloudflare2024-08-212025-01-04N/A\nsymdlotic[.]comCloudflare2024-08-212025-01-07N/A\nsynbioltic[.]comCloudflare2024-08-212025-01-07N/A\nsymbliatc[.]comCloudflare2024-08-202024-12-30N/A\nsymbietic[.]comCloudflare2024-08-192025-01-07N/A\ncomteste[.]comCloudflare2024-08-192025-01-07N/A\nsymdilotic[.]comCloudflare2024-08-202024-12-30N/A\nv2-rubby[.]comCloudflare2024-05-222025-01-07N/A\n\nTable 3: Domains linked to the same suspected shell website linked to the fake Brazilian organization referenced above (Source: Recorded Future)\nIt remains uncertain whether all the domains in Table 3 are malicious or connected to the same activity. However, their shared hosting of the same website, impersonation of other brands (such as ChainList), and partial verification of links to infections make them, at the very least, suspicious.\nTAG-124 Delivery Servers\nTAG-124 leverages compromised WordPress websites for various components of its infection chains. The servers embedded in the DOMs of these compromised first-stage WordPress sites, as detailed in the First-Stage WordPress Websites in Initial Delivery section, are likely owned by the threat actors. Insikt Group identified a significant network of servers connected to and likely controlled by the TAG-124 threat actors (see Table 4).\n\nDomainIP AddressFirst SeenLast SeenNotes\nambiwa[.]com45[.]61[.]136[.]92024-12-282025-01-07\ngcafin[.]com45[.]61[.]136[.]92024-12-292025-01-06\ndiscoves[.]com45[.]61[.]136[.]92024-12-262025-01-06\nxaides[.]com45[.]61[.]136[.]402025-01-022025-01-07\nusbkits[.]com45[.]61[.]136[.]402025-01-022025-01-07\nmirugby[.]com45[.]61[.]136[.]402025-01-022025-01-07\necrut[.]com45[.]61[.]136[.]412025-01-062025-01-07\npursyst[.]com45[.]61[.]136[.]412025-01-062025-01-07\npushcg[.]com45[.]61[.]136[.]672024-09-182025-01-07\npiedsmontlaw[.]com45[.]61[.]136[.]672022-12-222025-01-06\npemalite[.]com45[.]61[.]136[.]672022-12-222025-01-07\nhowmanychairs[.]com45[.]61[.]136[.]672024-03-142025-01-06\ncalbbs[.]com45[.]61[.]136[.]892024-12-182025-01-07\nhabfan[.]com45[.]61[.]136[.]1322024-12-072025-01-07\niognews[.]com45[.]61[.]136[.]1322024-12-062025-01-07\nsafigdata[.]com45[.]61[.]136[.]1962024-11-192025-01-07\nz-v2-071924[.]kailib[.]com45[.]61[.]136[.]1962024-11-132024-11-29\nz-v2-071810[.]kailib[.]com45[.]61[.]136[.]1962024-11-102024-11-13\nnyciot[.]com45[.]61[.]136[.]1962024-11-202025-01-07\npweobmxdlboi[.]com64[.]7[.]198[.]662024-08-272025-01-07\nboneyn[.]com64[.]94[.]85[.]982024-12-222025-01-07\nsatpr[.]com64[.]94[.]85[.]982024-12-222025-01-07\ncoeshor[.]com64[.]94[.]85[.]2482024-12-062025-01-07\nmtclibraries[.]com64[.]94[.]85[.]2482024-12-112025-01-07\nz-v2-072122[.]kailib[.]com64[.]94[.]85[.]2482024-11-182024-11-29\nsdrce[.]com64[.]95[.]11[.]652024-12-132025-01-07\ntheinb[.]com64[.]95[.]11[.]652024-12-132025-01-07\nelizgallery[.]com64[.]95[.]11[.]1842024-11-202025-01-07\nenethost[.]com64[.]95[.]12[.]382024-12-262025-01-07\ndhusch[.]com64[.]95[.]12[.]382024-12-242025-01-07\nfastard[.]com64[.]95[.]12[.]382024-12-252025-01-07\nfranklinida[.]com64[.]95[.]12[.]982024-10-182025-01-07\nnastictac[.]com64[.]190[.]113[.]412024-11-252025-01-07\ndncoding[.]com64[.]190[.]113[.]412024-11-262025-01-07\ndjnito[.]com64[.]190[.]113[.]1112024-12-112025-01-07\nopgears[.]com64[.]190[.]113[.]1112024-12-112025-01-07\ntickerwell[.]com162[.]33[.]177[.]362024-11-192025-01-07\nselmanc[.]com162[.]33[.]177[.]822024-12-162025-01-07\ntibetin[.]com162[.]33[.]177[.]822024-12-162025-01-07\nmercro[.]com162[.]33[.]178[.]592024-10-312025-01-07\nesaleerugs[.]com162[.]33[.]178[.]632024-11-222025-01-07\ntayakay[.]com162[.]33[.]178[.]752024-11-152024-11-15\nilsotto[.]com162[.]33[.]178[.]1132024-11-232025-01-07\nchewels[.]com193[.]149[.]176[.]1792024-12-052025-01-07\nsokrpro[.]com193[.]149[.]176[.]2232024-12-202025-01-07\nhdtele[.]com193[.]149[.]176[.]2232024-12-202025-01-07\nchhimi[.]com193[.]149[.]176[.]2482024-08-152025-01-07\ndechromo[.]com216[.]245[.]184[.]1792024-12-092025-01-07\nenerjjoy[.]com216[.]245[.]184[.]1792024-12-092025-01-07\ndsassoc[.]com216[.]245[.]184[.]1792024-12-182025-01-07\ngwcomics[.]com216[.]245[.]184[.]2102024-12-192025-01-07\ngenhil[.]com216[.]245[.]184[.]2252024-11-182025-01-07\nvicrin[.]com216[.]245[.]184[.]2252024-11-052025-01-07\neliztalks[.]com216[.]245[.]184[.]2252024-11-162025-01-07\nrshank[.]com216[.]245[.]184[.]2252024-11-132025-01-06\n\nTable 4: Likely threat actor-controlled TAG-124 delivery servers (Source: Recorded Future)\nMost of the domains began resolving in November 2024, suggesting that TAG-124 gained momentum during this period, with the majority of the domains still active at the time of analysis. Of note, two domains hosted on 45[.]61[.]136[.]67, namely piedsmontlaw[.]com and pemalite[.]com, were already resolving to this IP address in 2022, indicating that the server may have already been under the control of the threat actor during that time.\nSuspected Higher-Tier Infrastructure\nThe majority of the suspected threat actor-controlled TAG-124 delivery servers, as listed in the TAG-124 Delivery Servers section, have been seen communicating with a server over TCP port 443 (see Figure 1). The configurations of this server are similar to those of the delivery servers and host a domain that returns only a generic HTML page when accessed. At the time of analysis, Insikt Group could not determine the exact purpose of this server but suspects it plays a central role in the operation. One possibility is that it contains the core logic of the TDS.\nAdditionally, Insikt Group identified a suspected management server linked to TAG-124. This server has been observed communicating with the delivery servers via TCP ports 80 and 443. It has also interacted with another panel linked to TAG-124, referred to as the \"Ads Panel\", whose purpose includes serving the latest delivery server through a specified endpoint, among others (see Figure 1).\nAppendix A  Indicators of Compromise\n\nLikely Compromised WordPress Domains Used by

The group used lure documents themed around the 2024 Taiwanese presidential candidate Terry Gou, the Vietnamese National Holiday, flood protection in Mongolia, and meeting invitations, including an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) meeting. RedDelta likely compromised the Mongolian Ministry of Defense in August 2024 and the Communist Party of Vietnam in November 2024. The group conducted spearphishing targeting the Vietnamese Ministry of Public Security, but Insikt Group observed no evidence of  successful compromise. From September to December 2024, RedDelta likely targeted victims in Malaysia, Japan, the United States, Ethiopia, Brazil, Australia, and India.</p><p>In late 2023, RedDelta evolved the first stage of its infection chain to leverage a Windows Shortcut (LNK) file likely delivered via spearphishing. In 2024, the group transitioned to using Microsoft Management Console Snap-In Control (MSC) files. Most recently, RedDelta used spearphishing links to prompt a victim to load an HTML file remotely hosted on Microsoft Azure. Since July 2023, RedDelta has consistently used the Cloudflare content distribution network (CDN) to proxy command-and-control (C2) traffic, which enables the group to blend in with legitimate CDN traffic and complicates victim identification. Other state-sponsored groups, including Russias BlueAlpha, have similarly leveraged Cloudflare to evade detection.</p><p>RedDeltas activities align with Chinese strategic priorities, focusing on governments and diplomatic organizations in Southeast Asia, Mongolia, and Europe. The groups Asia-focused targeting in 2023 and 2024 represents a return to the groups historical focus after targeting European organizations in 2022. RedDeltas targeting of Mongolia and Taiwan is consistent with the groups past targeting of groups seen as threats to the Chinese Communist Partys power.</p><h2 id=\"about-reddelta\">About RedDelta:</h2><p>RedDelta has been active since at least 2012 and has focused on targeting Southeast Asia and Mongolia. The group has routinely adapted its targeting in response to global geopolitical events. <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/reddelta-targets-catholic-organizations\">RedDelta targeted the Vatican and other Catholic organizations</a> with PlugX before 2021 talks between China  and the Vatican. The has group <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/reddelta-cyber-threat-operations\">compromised</a> law enforcement and government entities in India, a government organization in Indonesia, and other targets across Myanmar, Hong Kong, and Australia.</p><p>In 2022, <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/reddelta-targets-european-government-organizations-continues-iterate-custom-plugx-variant\">RedDelta shifted toward increased targeting of European government and diplomatic entities</a> following Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine. This activity used an infection chain that began by delivering an archive file (ZIP, RAR, or ISO), which was likely delivered via spearphishing. The file contained a Windows Shortcut (LNK) file disguised with a double extension (such as .doc.lnk) and a Microsoft Word icon. Hidden folders within the archive contained three files used to complete dynamic-link library (DLL) search order hijacking: a legitimate binary, a malicious DLL loader, and an encrypted PlugX payload that was ultimately loaded into memory. User execution of the Shortcut file led to DLL search order hijacking. In November 2022, RedDelta evolved its tactics to stage the ISO file on a threat actor-controlled domain.</p><p>In March 2023, Insikt Group identified RedDelta targeting Mongolia using a similar infection chain that started with a container file (RAR, ZIP, ISO) consisting of an LNK file that triggered a DLL search order hijacking triad located within a hidden nested subdirectory. Decoy documents included an invitation from the World Association of Mongolia and a document claiming to be a BBC news interview about Tibetan Buddhism and Mongolia. RedDelta targeted: </p><ul><li>Members of multiple Mongolian non-governmental organizations (NGOs), including a human rights and pro-democracy NGO focused on the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region</li><li>Mongolian Buddhist activists in Mongolia and Japan</li><li>Academic professionals in Mongolia and Japan</li><li>Developers of two Mongolian mobile applications</li></ul><h2 id=\"mitigations\">Mitigations:</h2><p>To detect and mitigate RedDelta activity, organizations should:</p><ul><li>Use YARA and Sigma rules provided by Insikt Group to detect RedDelta Windows Installer (MSI), DLL, and LNK files (see below).</li><li>Configure intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), and other network defense mechanisms to alert on or block connection attempts from external IP addresses and domains associated with RedDelta (see below).</li><li>Keep software and applications  particularly operating systems, antivirus software, and core system utilities  up to date.</li><li>Filter email correspondence and scrutinize attachments for malware.</li><li>Conduct regular system backups and store them offline and offsite to ensure they are inaccessible via the network.</li><li>Adhere to strict compartmentalization of company-sensitive data, institute role-based access, and limit company-wide data access.</li><li>Deploy client-based host logging and intrusion detection capabilities to identify and thwart attacks early.</li><li>Prevent threat actors from bypassing security by disabling outdated authentication methods.</li><li>Implement tools like network IDS, NetFlow collection, host logging, and web proxy, alongside manual monitoring of detection sources.</li><li>Practice network segmentation and ensure special protections exist for sensitive information, such as multifactor authentication, and restricted accesss.</li></ul><p>Leverage the <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/third-party-intelligence\">Recorded Future Third-Party Intelligence module</a> and <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform/browser-extension\">Threat Intelligence Browser Extension</a> for real-time monitoring and prioritized vulnerability patching.</p><p>Review public guidance (<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-158a\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-144a\">2</a>, <a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2019/Oct/07/2002191601/-1/-1/0/Mitigating%20Recent%20VPN%20Vulnerabilities%20-%20Copy.pdf\">3</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa20-258a\">4</a>) and Insikt Groups <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/charting-chinas-climb-leading-global-cyber-power\">Charting Chinas Climb as a Leading Global Cyber Power</a> report for comprehensive recommendations for mitigating Chinese advanced persistent threat activity more broadly.</p><h2 id=\"outlook\">Outlook:</h2><p>Insikt Group anticipates that RedDelta will continue targeting organizations worldwide with its customized PlugX backdoor, focusing on Southeast Asia and Chinas periphery, including Mongolia and Taiwan. Likely targets include governments, NGOs, activists, and religious organizations. RedDelta has continually evolved its infection chain and is anticipated to continue doing so in the future in response to major geopolitical developments.</p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a

2024, Insikt Group observed the Chinese state-sponsored group RedDelta targeting Mongolia, Taiwan, Myanmar, Vietnam, and Cambodia with an adapted infection chain to distribute its customized PlugX backdoor. The group used lure documents themed around the 2024 Taiwanese presidential candidate Terry Gou, the Vietnamese National Holiday, flood protection in Mongolia, and meeting invitations, including an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) meeting. RedDelta likely compromised the Mongolian Ministry of Defense in August 2024 and the Communist Party of Vietnam in November 2024. The group conducted spearphishing targeting the Vietnamese Ministry of Public Security, but Insikt Group observed no evidence of  successful compromise. From September to December 2024, RedDelta likely targeted victims in Malaysia, Japan, the United States, Ethiopia, Brazil, Australia, and India.\nIn late 2023, RedDelta evolved the first stage of its infection chain to leverage a Windows Shortcut (LNK) file likely delivered via spearphishing. In 2024, the group transitioned to using Microsoft Management Console Snap-In Control (MSC) files. Most recently, RedDelta used spearphishing links to prompt a victim to load an HTML file remotely hosted on Microsoft Azure. Since July 2023, RedDelta has consistently used the Cloudflare content distribution network (CDN) to proxy command-and-control (C2) traffic, which enables the group to blend in with legitimate CDN traffic and complicates victim identification. Other state-sponsored groups, including Russias BlueAlpha, have similarly leveraged Cloudflare to evade detection.\nRedDeltas activities align with Chinese strategic priorities, focusing on governments and diplomatic organizations in Southeast Asia, Mongolia, and Europe. The groups Asia-focused targeting in 2023 and 2024 represents a return to the groups historical focus after targeting European organizations in 2022. RedDeltas targeting of Mongolia and Taiwan is consistent with the groups past targeting of groups seen as threats to the Chinese Communist Partys power.\nAbout RedDelta:\nRedDelta has been active since at least 2012 and has focused on targeting Southeast Asia and Mongolia. The group has routinely adapted its targeting in response to global geopolitical events. RedDelta targeted the Vatican and other Catholic organizations with PlugX before 2021 talks between China  and the Vatican. The has group compromised law enforcement and government entities in India, a government organization in Indonesia, and other targets across Myanmar, Hong Kong, and Australia.\nIn 2022, RedDelta shifted toward increased targeting of European government and diplomatic entities following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This activity used an infection chain that began by delivering an archive file (ZIP, RAR, or ISO), which was likely delivered via spearphishing. The file contained a Windows Shortcut (LNK) file disguised with a double extension (such as .doc.lnk) and a Microsoft Word icon. Hidden folders within the archive contained three files used to complete dynamic-link library (DLL) search order hijacking: a legitimate binary, a malicious DLL loader, and an encrypted PlugX payload that was ultimately loaded into memory. User execution of the Shortcut file led to DLL search order hijacking. In November 2022, RedDelta evolved its tactics to stage the ISO file on a threat actor-controlled domain.\nIn March 2023, Insikt Group identified RedDelta targeting Mongolia using a similar infection chain that started with a container file (RAR, ZIP, ISO) consisting of an LNK file that triggered a DLL search order hijacking triad located within a hidden nested subdirectory. Decoy documents included an invitation from the World Association of Mongolia and a document claiming to be a BBC news interview about Tibetan Buddhism and Mongolia. RedDelta targeted: \n\nMembers of multiple Mongolian non-governmental organizations (NGOs), including a human rights and pro-democracy NGO focused on the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region\nMongolian Buddhist activists in Mongolia and Japan\nAcademic professionals in Mongolia and Japan\nDevelopers of two Mongolian mobile applications\n\nMitigations:\nTo detect and mitigate RedDelta activity, organizations should:\n\nUse YARA and Sigma rules provided by Insikt Group to detect RedDelta Windows Installer (MSI), DLL, and LNK files (see below).\nConfigure intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), and other network defense mechanisms to alert on or block connection attempts from external IP addresses and domains associated with RedDelta (see below).\nKeep software and applications  particularly operating systems, antivirus software, and core system utilities  up to date.\nFilter email correspondence and scrutinize attachments for malware.\nConduct regular system backups and store them offline and offsite to ensure they are inaccessible via the network.\nAdhere to strict compartmentalization of company-sensitive data, institute role-based access, and limit company-wide data access.\nDeploy client-based host logging and intrusion detection capabilities to identify and thwart attacks early.\nPrevent threat actors from bypassing security by disabling outdated authentication methods.\nImplement tools like network IDS, NetFlow collection, host logging, and web proxy, alongside manual monitoring of detection sources.\nPractice network segmentation and ensure special protections exist for sensitive information, such as multifactor authentication, and restricted accesss.\n\nLeverage the Recorded Future Third-Party Intelligence module and Threat Intelligence Browser Extension for real-time monitoring and prioritized vulnerability patching.\nReview public guidance (1, 2, 3, 4) and Insikt Groups Charting Chinas Climb as a Leading Global Cyber Power report for comprehensive recommendations for mitigating Chinese advanced persistent threat activity more broadly.\nOutlook:\nInsikt Group anticipates that RedDelta will continue targeting organizations worldwide with its customized PlugX backdoor, focusing on Southeast Asia and Chinas periphery, including Mongolia and Taiwan. Likely targets include governments, NGOs, activists, and religious organizations. RedDelta has continually evolved its infection chain and is anticipated to continue doing so in the future in response to major geopolitical developments.\nTo read the entire analysis, click here to

The scale of this increase in the past two years invites a sense of urgency and concern, especially when the attack surface for data breaches is moving further out of companies control. Based on what we can measure, the costliest impacts of data breaches in the last several years have been operational disruption, legal risks, and declining sales due to churn and loss of customer trust.

While 2024 data is not yet complete, Recorded Future data on validated data breaches project a further 5% increase in 2024 compared to 2023. The scale of this increase in the past two years invites a sense of urgency and concern, especially when the attack surface for data breaches is moving further out of companies control. Based on what we can measure, the costliest impacts of data breaches in the last several years have been operational disruption, legal risks, and declining sales due to churn and loss of customer trust.

BlueAlpha has been active since at least 2014 and continues to target Ukrainian organizations through relentless spearphishing campaigns to distribute custom malware. Since at least October 2023 BlueAlpha has delivered the custom VBScript malware GammaLoad, enabling data exfiltration, credential theft, and persistent access to compromised networks. \nBlueAlpha Abuses Cloudflare Tunneling Service for GammaDrop Staging Infrastructure\nBlueAlpha has recently evolved its malware delivery chain to now leverage Cloudflare Tunnels for staging GammaDrop malware, a tactic popularized by cybercriminal threat groups to deploy malware.\nKey Findings:\n\nBlueAlpha uses Cloudflare Tunnels to conceal its GammaDrop staging infrastructure, evading traditional network detection mechanisms.\nThe group delivers malware through HTML smuggling, leveraging sophisticated techniques to bypass email security systems.\nDNS fast-fluxing complicates efforts to track and disrupt command-and-control (C2) communications.\n\nHow BlueAlpha Exploits Cloudflare Tunnels\nCloudflare offers the tunneling service for free with the use of the TryCloudflare tool. The tool allows anyone to create a tunnel using a randomly generated subdomain of trycloudflare.com and have all requests to that subdomain proxied through the Cloudflare network to the web server running on that host. BlueAlpha leverages this to conceal staging infrastructure used to deploy GammaDrop. \nHTML Smuggling\nHTML smuggling enables malware delivery through embedded JavaScript in HTML attachments. BlueAlpha has refined this method with subtle modifications to avoid detection. Recent samples show changes in deobfuscation methods, such as using the onerror HTML event to execute malicious code.\nGammaDrop and GammaLoad Malware\nBlueAlphas malware suite is central to its campaigns:\n\nGammaDrop: acts as a dropper, writing GammaLoad to disk and ensuring persistence\nGammaLoad: a custom loader capable of beaconing to its C2 and executing additional malware\n\nBlueAlpha uses obfuscation techniques, namely extensive amounts of junk code and random variable names to complicate analysis.\nMitigation Strategies\n\nEnhance Email Security: Deploy solutions to inspect and block HTML smuggling techniques. Flag attachments with suspicious HTML events like onerror.\nRestrict Execution of Malicious Files: Implement application control policies to block malicious use of mshta.exe and untrusted .lnk files.\nMonitor Network Traffic: Set up rules to flag requests to trycloudflare.com subdomains and unauthorized DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) connections.\nLeverage Threat Intelligence: Use Recorded Futures Malware mitigation solution to analyze suspicious files and stay informed about emerging threats.\n\nOutlook\nBlueAlphas continued use of legitimate services like Cloudflare demonstrates its commitment to refining evasion techniques.

Leveraging AI-enhanced videos and impersonating reputable news sources, Operation Undercut disseminates disinformation targeting audiences across the US, Ukraine, and Europe. This operation, running in tandem with other campaigns like <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/russian-influence-network-doppelgangers-ai-content-tactics\">Doppelgnger</a>, is designed to discredit Ukraines leadership, question the effectiveness of Western aid, and stir socio-political tensions. The campaign also seeks to shape narratives around the 2024 US elections and geopolitical conflicts, such as the Israel-Gaza situation, to deepen divisions.</p><h2 id=\"operation-undercut-shows-multifaceted-nature-of-sdas-influence-operations\">&quot;Operation Undercut&quot; Shows Multifaceted Nature of SDAs Influence Operations</h2><p>Russia&#39;s Social Design Agency (SDA) has been running an influence operation known as &quot;Operation Undercut&quot; since late 2023, aiming to <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/russia-seeks-exploit-western-war-fatigue-win-ukraine\">erode Western support for Ukraine</a>. Using a mix of AI-enhanced media and impersonation tactics, Operation Undercut employs advanced methods to manipulate public opinion. </p><h2 id=\"objectives\">Objectives</h2><p>Operation Undercut is part of Russia&#39;s broader strategy to destabilize Western alliances and portray Ukraines leadership as ineffective and corrupt. By targeting audiences in Europe and the US, the SDA seeks to amplify anti-Ukraine sentiment, hoping to reduce the flow of Western military aid to Ukraine. The operation also spreads narratives that suggest US and EU involvement in Ukraine is misguided, costly, and largely ineffective.</p><p>In addition to undermining support for Ukraine, Operation Undercut <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/russian-information-operations-divide-western-coalition-ukraine\">seeks to widen existing divisions within Western societies</a>. The campaign addresses several geopolitical issues, such as the Israel-Gaza conflict, the EU&#39;s internal politics, and the <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/malign-influence-threats-mount-ahead-us-2024-elections\">2024 US elections</a>. By connecting Ukraine&#39;s fate to these contentious topics, Operation Undercut attempts to stoke anxieties and polarize public opinion.</p><h2 id=\"tactics-techniques-and-procedures-ttps\">Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)</h2><p><strong>AI-Enhanced Videos and Impersonation of News Outlets</strong></p><p>Operation Undercut uses <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/adversarial-intelligence-red-teaming-malicious-use-cases-ai\">AI-enhanced videos and images, many of which mimic trusted media sources</a>, to make disinformation appear credible. AI-generated voiceovers and realistic images amplify these narratives, creating content that is difficult to distinguish from legitimate news. By adopting branding elements from respected outlets, the operation enhances its contents believability, misleading audiences and eroding trust in genuine media sources.</p><p><strong>Targeted Social Media Campaigns</strong></p><p>SDA&#39;s accounts post highly tailored content on multiple platforms, often using trending hashtags to reach target audiences. The content varies by region and language, including posts in English, German, French, Polish, and Turkish, ensuring that messages resonate across diverse audiences. By focusing on real-time issues, the operation maximizes its reach, though most posts have shown limited engagement.</p><p><strong>Amplification of CopyCop Content</strong></p><p>Operation Undercut has amplified content from <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/copycop-expands-to-cover-us-elections-target-political-leaders\">CopyCop (also known as Storm-1516), a Russian influence network</a> linked to John Mark Dougan and allegedly backed by Alexander Dugin&#39;s Centre for Geopolitical Expertise (CGE) and the GRU&#39;s Unit 29155. Examples include a <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/deepfakes-id-verification\">deepfake video</a> featuring a supposed Hamas member threatening the 2024 Paris Olympics and an image accusing Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky of buying an Italian villa during the 2024 G7 summit.</p><h2 id=\"key-narratives\">Key Narratives</h2><p><strong>Discrediting Ukraine and Western Aid</strong></p><p>One of Operation Undercuts primary themes is discrediting Ukraines leadership and questioning the effectiveness of Western aid. The campaign accuses Ukrainian leaders of corruption, claiming they misuse foreign aid to fund luxurious lifestyles. This narrative aims to undermine public support for continued financial and military assistance to Ukraine, particularly among European audiences.</p><p><strong>Exploiting the Israel-Gaza Conflict</strong></p><p>The operation also attempts to manipulate public opinion regarding the Israel-Gaza conflict, alleging Western bias and intelligence manipulation. By highlighting divisive issues in global politics, Operation Undercut creates distractions and deepens divides, weakening Western alliances and distracting from Russia&#39;s involvement in Ukraine.</p><p><strong>Tensions Within the EU and US Election Influence</strong></p><p>Operation Undercut amplifies existing political tensions within the European Union by supporting far-right narratives and criticizing EU leaders. Similarly, it seeks to influence the 2024 US elections by framing military aid to Ukraine as a contentious political issue. By presenting Ukraines future as contingent on US election outcomes, the operation fosters anxiety over the West&#39;s political stability.</p><h2 id=\"mitigations\">Mitigations</h2><ul><li>News organizations should track content from known influence actors who are likely abusing their brand. Such abuse increases reputational risks and erodes consumer trust, potentially deterring advertisers and inflicting financial harm on the impersonated organizations.</li><li>Political leaders and government officials from countries providing support to Ukraine should continue monitoring for content attempting to discredit them to identify and counter emerging narratives.</li><li>Public and news organizations can use <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/brand-intelligence\">Recorded Future Brand Intelligence</a> to track and combat typosquatting domains and infringing content on similar domains, which can harm a news organizations reputation.</li><li>Clients can use the <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform/intelligence-cloud\">Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud</a> to track Operation Undercut activity and Recorded Future AI to summarize and track emerging narratives.</li></ul><h2 id=\"outlook\">Outlook</h2><p>The SDA is expected to continue running influence operations, including Operation Undercut, while likely rebuilding infrastructure for Doppelgnger and using established content and amplification tactics. Tasked by Russias Presidential Administration, these operations aim to shape global opinions on Ukraine and exploit major events to undermine support for Ukraine.

This operation, running in tandem with other campaigns like Doppelgnger, is designed to discredit Ukraines leadership, question the effectiveness of Western aid, and stir socio-political tensions. The campaign also seeks to shape narratives around the 2024 US elections and geopolitical conflicts, such as the Israel-Gaza situation, to deepen divisions.\n\"Operation Undercut\" Shows Multifaceted Nature of SDAs Influence Operations\nRussia's Social Design Agency (SDA) has been running an influence operation known as \"Operation Undercut\" since late 2023, aiming to erode Western support for Ukraine. Using a mix of AI-enhanced media and impersonation tactics, Operation Undercut employs advanced methods to manipulate public opinion. \nObjectives\nOperation Undercut is part of Russia's broader strategy to destabilize Western alliances and portray Ukraines leadership as ineffective and corrupt. By targeting audiences in Europe and the US, the SDA seeks to amplify anti-Ukraine sentiment, hoping to reduce the flow of Western military aid to Ukraine. The operation also spreads narratives that suggest US and EU involvement in Ukraine is misguided, costly, and largely ineffective.\nIn addition to undermining support for Ukraine, Operation Undercut seeks to widen existing divisions within Western societies. The campaign addresses several geopolitical issues, such as the Israel-Gaza conflict, the EU's internal politics, and the 2024 US elections. By connecting Ukraine's fate to these contentious topics, Operation Undercut attempts to stoke anxieties and polarize public opinion.\nTactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)\nAI-Enhanced Videos and Impersonation of News Outlets\nOperation Undercut uses AI-enhanced videos and images, many of which mimic trusted media sources, to make disinformation appear credible. AI-generated voiceovers and realistic images amplify these narratives, creating content that is difficult to distinguish from legitimate news. By adopting branding elements from respected outlets, the operation enhances its contents believability, misleading audiences and eroding trust in genuine media sources.\nTargeted Social Media Campaigns\nSDA's accounts post highly tailored content on multiple platforms, often using trending hashtags to reach target audiences. The content varies by region and language, including posts in English, German, French, Polish, and Turkish, ensuring that messages resonate across diverse audiences. By focusing on real-time issues, the operation maximizes its reach, though most posts have shown limited engagement.\nAmplification of CopyCop Content\nOperation Undercut has amplified content from CopyCop (also known as Storm-1516), a Russian influence network linked to John Mark Dougan and allegedly backed by Alexander Dugin's Centre for Geopolitical Expertise (CGE) and the GRU's Unit 29155. Examples include a deepfake video featuring a supposed Hamas member threatening the 2024 Paris Olympics and an image accusing Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky of buying an Italian villa during the 2024 G7 summit.\nKey Narratives\nDiscrediting Ukraine and Western Aid\nOne of Operation Undercuts primary themes is discrediting Ukraines leadership and questioning the effectiveness of Western aid. The campaign accuses Ukrainian leaders of corruption, claiming they misuse foreign aid to fund luxurious lifestyles. This narrative aims to undermine public support for continued financial and military assistance to Ukraine, particularly among European audiences.\nExploiting the Israel-Gaza Conflict\nThe operation also attempts to manipulate public opinion regarding the Israel-Gaza conflict, alleging Western bias and intelligence manipulation. By highlighting divisive issues in global politics, Operation Undercut creates distractions and deepens divides, weakening Western alliances and distracting from Russia's involvement in Ukraine.\nTensions Within the EU and US Election Influence\nOperation Undercut amplifies existing political tensions within the European Union by supporting far-right narratives and criticizing EU leaders. Similarly, it seeks to influence the 2024 US elections by framing military aid to Ukraine as a contentious political issue. By presenting Ukraines future as contingent on US election outcomes, the operation fosters anxiety over the West's political stability.\nMitigations\n\nNews organizations should track content from known influence actors who are likely abusing their brand. Such abuse increases reputational risks and erodes consumer trust, potentially deterring advertisers and inflicting financial harm on the impersonated organizations.\nPolitical leaders and government officials from countries providing support to Ukraine should continue monitoring for content attempting to discredit them to identify and counter emerging narratives.\nPublic and news organizations can use Recorded Future Brand Intelligence to track and combat typosquatting domains and infringing content on similar domains, which can harm a news organizations reputation.\nClients can use the Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud to track Operation Undercut activity and Recorded Future AI to summarize and track emerging narratives.\n\nOutlook\nThe SDA is expected to continue running influence operations, including Operation Undercut, while likely rebuilding infrastructure for Doppelgnger and using established content and amplification tactics. Tasked by Russias Presidential Administration, these operations aim to shape global opinions on Ukraine and exploit major events to undermine support for Ukraine. The investigation, which uses data from Recorded Future, government sources, and other reports, underscores the value of a collaborative approach across sectors to expose and disrupt these destabilizing activities. \nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.","enclosure":{"url":"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/format_webp/operation_undercut_Main_Feature_7c0c877406.jpg","length":"0","type":"image/jpg"},"content":"Russia’s “Operation Undercut” uses AI-driven disinformation to sway opinion on Ukraine, aiming to erode Western support.

Fusion sounds high speed, but bringing together multiple teams for a shared mission can slow down operations if not managed effectively. A traditional <a href=\"https://www.comptia.org/content/articles/what-is-a-security-operations-center\">SOC</a> masquerading as a fusion center with little more than <a href=\"https://threatbutt.com/map/\">pew pew maps</a> (not to diminish their effectiveness with executives) defeats the purpose. A successful fusion center removes data silos and works across traditionally divided teams (e.g., Incident Response, Cyber Threat Intelligence, Fraud)  to improve threat actor campaign analysis and reduce losses. Cyber-fraud fusion centers improve communication and collaboration through organizational (and perhaps physical) proximity, leading to better fraud loss reduction outcomes. </p><h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2><p>Before exposing cyber-fraud data flows and focused loss mitigation examples, a few words about the problem and a prerequisite for success. In January, Nasdaq released a <a href=\"https://ir.nasdaq.com/news-releases/news-release-details/nasdaq-releases-first-global-financial-crime-report-measuring\">remarkable report</a> that quantified illicit money movement, including losses from fraud scams and bank fraud schemes accounted for nearly $500 billion globally in 2023. That number is a significant enticement for threat actors to continue with successful tactics while also investing in new fraud innovations. </p><p>A thriving fusion center requires a leader with vision and experience (in cyber defense operations and fraud) and the mandate authority (juice) to remove traditional enterprise barriers (organizational empire building, information gatekeeping, vendor firewalling, etc.). </p><h2 id=\"improved-data-driven-workflows\">Improved Data-Driven Workflows</h2><p>The fusion concept is vital in this fraud context because CTI analysts generally focus on identifying malicious fraud communities and associated TTPs (tools, tactics, procedures). Fraud analysts, conversely, are concerned with creating fraud analytics toward enhanced remediation. In traditional organizations, the CTI and fraud teams sit in separate departments and are constrained by politically driven data silos.  Optimized information workflows for maximum fraud impact remain elusive. When implemented correctly, cyber-fraud fusion centers remove perverse incentives and enable a unified team to make the organization more effective. </p><p>In each of these examples, well examine how CTI can enrich fraud investigations and help shift from a reactive to a proactive posture (though overused, this proactive notion is appropriate here).</p><h2 id=\"example-alpha---payment-cards\">Example Alpha - Payment Cards</h2><p>A straightforward example includes payment card fraud (card present - CP and card not present - CNP).

Malicious Traffic Analysis (MTA) can help detect unusual activity, alerting security teams to potential C2 communications.\n\nOutlook\nTAG-112s operations against Tibetan organizations reflect a longstanding objective within Chinese cyber-espionage campaigns to monitor and control ethnic and religious minorities, especially those seen as potentially destabilizing. Other groups and regions with similar CCP-designated risk profiles are likely targets of similar state-sponsored attacks.\nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.\nAppendix A  Indicators of Compromise\n\nCompromised Websites:\ntibetpost[.]net\ngyudmedtantricuniversity[.]org\nC2 Domains:\nmaskrisks[.]com\nmail[.]maskrisks[.]com\nupdate[.]maskrisks[.]com\ncheckupdate[.]maskrisks[.]com\n\nC2 IP Addresses:\n154.90.62[.]12\n154.90.63[.]166\n154.205.138[.]202\nCertificates:\nd0972247c500d2a45f412f9434287161de395a35ef5b4931cba12cf513b76962(*[.]dnspod[.]cn)\n94569f64f62eff185ba47e991dba54bdeea6d1a9e205d6bec767be6a864e4efb (Cloudflare Origin *.maskrisks[.]com)\nd4938cb5c031ec7f04d73d4e75f5db5c8a5c04ce (Stolen code-signing certificate KP MOBILE)\nURLs of malicious JavaScript:\nhttps[:]//gyudmedtantricuniversity[.]org/templates/lt_interiordesign/js/custom.js\nhttps[:]//tibetpost[.]net/templates/ja_teline_v/js/gallery/jquery.blueimp-gallery.full.js\nMalicious URLs:\nhttps[:]//update[.]maskrisks[.]com/download \nhttps[:]//update[.]maskrisks[.]com/?type=Chrome\nhttps[:]//update[.]maskrisks[.]com/?type=Edge\nhttp[:]//mail[.]maskrisks[.]com/api/view.php\nhttp[:]//154.205.138[.]202/GetUrl/cache\nhttps[:]//checkupdate[.]maskrisks[.]com/cache\nhttps[:]//update[.]maskrisks[.]com/cache\nCobalt Strike:\n1e42cbe23055e921eff46e5e6921ff1a20bb903fca83ea1f1294394c0df3f4cd\n0e306c0836a8ee035ae739c5adfbe42bd5021e615ebaa92f52d5d86fb895651d\nf1f11e52a60e5a446f1eb17bb718358def4825342acc0a41d09a051359a1eb3d\nf4ded3a67480a0e2a822af1e87a727243dea16ac1a3c0513aec62bff71f06b27\n966d311dcc598922e4ab9ce5524110a8bfd2c6b6db540d180829ceb7a7253831\n1e7cb19f77206317c8828f9c3cdee76f2f0ebf7451a625641f7d22bb8c61b21b\nLoaders:\n8d4049ef70c83a6ead26736c1330e2783bdc9708c497183317fad66b818e44cb\nE190c7e097a1c38dd45d9c149e737ad9253b1cabee1cee7ef080ddf52d1b378c (legitimate software)\n31f11b4d81f3ae25b6a01cd1038914f31d045bc4136c40a6221944ea553d6414\n\n\n            \n\n\nAppendix B  Mitre ATT&CK Techniques\n\nTactic: TechniqueATT&CK Code\nResource Development: Acquire Infrastructure: ServerT1583.004\nResource Development: Acquire Infrastructure: Web ServicesT1583.006\nResource Development: Compromise Infrastructure: ServerT1584.004\nInitial Access: Drive-by CompromiseT1189\nDefense Evasion: Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Side-LoadingT1574.002","enclosure":{"url":"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/format_webp/cta_cn_2024_1112_Main_Feature_18ea548089.jpg","length":"0","type":"image/jpg"},"content":"China-based TAG-112 exploited Tibetan sites to spread Cobalt Strike malware.

Using fake news, fact-checking sites, and AI-generated audio, it seeks to manipulate public opinion by impersonating trusted media organizations. This campaign primarily targets media outlets, fact-checkers, and researchers, aiming to overwhelm investigative resources and insert false narratives into mainstream discourse, but also directly targets the general public. Operation Overload previously attempted to <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/russian-and-iranian-influence-networks-target-french-elections\">undermine the 2024 French elections</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/hurdling-over-hazards-multifaceted-threats-to-the-2024-paris-olympics\">Paris Olympics</a>, although with minimal success. Its goal now is to undermine trust in the US election process, exploit divisive social issues, stoke fears of political violence, and target candidates, particularly Vice President Kamala Harris.</p><h2 id=\"operation-overload-impersonates-media-to-influence-us-election\">Operation Overload Impersonates Media to Influence US Election</h2><p>Operation Overload, also known as Matryoshka and Storm-1679, is a sophisticated Russia-aligned influence campaign designed to manipulate public opinion and sow discord. Previously attempting to undermine the 2024 French elections and the Paris Olympics, the operation is now shifting its focus to the 2024 US presidential election. It involves creating fake news sites, false fact-checking resources, and AI-generated audio that mimics legitimate media outlets. By impersonating trusted news organizations, the operation seeks to establish credibility to influence its targets more effectively.</p><h3 id=\"key-tactics-and-techniques\">Key Tactics and Techniques</h3><ol><li><strong>Impersonation of Trusted Media Brands:</strong> Operation Overload relies heavily on impersonating reputable news outlets to lend credibility to its influence operations. By copying logos, using similar fonts and layouts, and falsely attributing content to real journalists, <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/russia-linked-copycop-uses-llms-to-weaponize-influence-content-at-scale\">it creates content that appears legitimate</a>. This includes recycling video and image materials from publicly available sources and generating professional-sounding AI-generated voiceovers.</li><li><strong>AI-Generated Content:</strong> One of the newer developments in Operation Overload&#39;s toolkit is the use of AI to generate realistic voiceovers. This content, often used in short videos, further amplifies its perceived credibility and makes it more challenging to differentiate between legitimate and fake information.</li><li><strong>Targeting of Media and Fact-Checking Organizations:</strong> Operation Overload directs much of its focus toward media organizations, fact-checkers, and researchers. By flooding them with spam-like requests and fake fact-checking leads, the operation seeks to overwhelm their resources. This makes it harder for them to debunk Russian disinformation and risks them inadvertently reporting on false content, thereby injecting Russian malign narratives into mainstream political discourse.</li><li><strong>Amplification Through Automated Social Media:</strong> The operation also utilizes automated bots to spread its influence content on social media. This tactic, referred to as coordinated inauthentic behavior (CIB), helps amplify false narratives on social media platforms, making the content more widespread and visible to the general public.</li></ol><h3 id=\"the-role-of-ai-in-operation-overload\">The Role of AI in Operation Overload</h3><p>One of the newer developments of Operation Overload is its reliance on AI-generated audio. <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/adversarial-intelligence-red-teaming-malicious-use-cases-ai\">AI is being used to create voiceovers and make fake media content</a> appear to be from legitimate media outlets.

Using fake news, fact-checking sites, and AI-generated audio, it seeks to manipulate public opinion by impersonating trusted media organizations. This campaign primarily targets media outlets, fact-checkers, and researchers, aiming to overwhelm investigative resources and insert false narratives into mainstream discourse, but also directly targets the general public. Operation Overload previously attempted to undermine the 2024 French elections and the Paris Olympics, although with minimal success. Its goal now is to undermine trust in the US election process, exploit divisive social issues, stoke fears of political violence, and target candidates, particularly Vice President Kamala Harris.\nOperation Overload Impersonates Media to Influence US Election\nOperation Overload, also known as Matryoshka and Storm-1679, is a sophisticated Russia-aligned influence campaign designed to manipulate public opinion and sow discord. Previously attempting to undermine the 2024 French elections and the Paris Olympics, the operation is now shifting its focus to the 2024 US presidential election. It involves creating fake news sites, false fact-checking resources, and AI-generated audio that mimics legitimate media outlets. By impersonating trusted news organizations, the operation seeks to establish credibility to influence its targets more effectively.\nKey Tactics and Techniques\n\nImpersonation of Trusted Media Brands: Operation Overload relies heavily on impersonating reputable news outlets to lend credibility to its influence operations. By copying logos, using similar fonts and layouts, and falsely attributing content to real journalists, it creates content that appears legitimate. This includes recycling video and image materials from publicly available sources and generating professional-sounding AI-generated voiceovers.\nAI-Generated Content: One of the newer developments in Operation Overload's toolkit is the use of AI to generate realistic voiceovers. This content, often used in short videos, further amplifies its perceived credibility and makes it more challenging to differentiate between legitimate and fake information.\nTargeting of Media and Fact-Checking Organizations: Operation Overload directs much of its focus toward media organizations, fact-checkers, and researchers. By flooding them with spam-like requests and fake fact-checking leads, the operation seeks to overwhelm their resources. This makes it harder for them to debunk Russian disinformation and risks them inadvertently reporting on false content, thereby injecting Russian malign narratives into mainstream political discourse.\nAmplification Through Automated Social Media: The operation also utilizes automated bots to spread its influence content on social media. This tactic, referred to as coordinated inauthentic behavior (CIB), helps amplify false narratives on social media platforms, making the content more widespread and visible to the general public.\n\nThe Role of AI in Operation Overload\nOne of the newer developments of Operation Overload is its reliance on AI-generated audio. AI is being used to create voiceovers and make fake media content appear to be from legitimate media outlets. This allows for the rapid production of high-quality disinformation at scale, making it more challenging to detect and debunk.\nImpacts on the 2024 US Election\nThe operation's primary goal is to overwhelm journalists and fact-checkers with persistent, spam-like requests to verify the operations inauthentic content, diverting resources from pursuing legitimate investigations and debunking Russian disinformation. The operation also hopes to use media organizations as a means of information laundering, more specifically, to inject malign content and pro-Kremlin narratives into mainstream political discourse via trusted parties. Finally, the operation seeks to directly inject influence content into mainstream discussion of contentious political issues, eroding public trust in the democratic process, provoking US domestic concerns of political violence and civil war, and exploiting existing social divisions.\nSome of the narratives pushed by Operation Overload include:\n\nStoking Fears of Political Violence: By amplifying concerns about civil unrest and even civil war, the operation seeks to provoke fear and uncertainty.\nTargeting Candidates: Vice President Harris, in particular, is a major target of the operation's disinformation efforts. Content falsely links her to a wide range of scandals, aiming to damage her reputation ahead of the election.\nVilifying Ukrainians and the LGBTQIA+ Community: The operation provokes negative sentiment toward these communities to decrease public support for Ukraine and exploit social divisions in the US, respectively.\n\nMitigations\nMitigating the potential effects of Operation Overload requires a coordinated effort between media organizations, fact-checkers, researchers, and policymakers. Here are key steps that can be taken:\n\nMonitoring Social Media Channels: Potentially targeted organizations should regularly monitor Telegram and social media channels identified in this report as promoting Operation Overload content, using appropriate operational security measures.\nStrengthening Fact-Checking Protocols: Media organizations should strengthen verification processes and source authentication measures where possible to prevent the unintentional spread of Operation Overload content. \nInformation Sharing: These organizations should also enhance information-sharing and coordination with their peers and the broader counter-influence community to decrease the likelihood of publishing a false fact-checking lead or inadvertently overexerting resources to pursue a deceptive lead.\nPublic Awareness and Media Literacy: Public education about how influence operations work is crucial. The general public needs to be aware of how to identify false information and be more discerning about the sources it trusts.\nRecorded Future Intelligence Cloud: Media entities, researchers, and public sector organizations can use the Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud to track research developments and other analyses of Operation Overloads emerging narratives ahead of the 2024 US election and its continued activities in Europe. Defenders can also use the Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud to monitor developments in previously documented and emerging influence operations from nation-state adversaries.\nRecorded Future Brand Intelligence: Media organizations can use Recorded Future Brand Intelligence to track and combat brand abuse, including attempted typosquatting and logo impersonation.\n\nOutlook\nAs the 2024 US election draws nearer, Operation Overload is very likely to ramp up its activities. The operation's administrators are expected to impersonate more media outlets and expand their reach. We expect Operation Overload to continue attempting to fuel polarization in the US by pushing narratives that deepen existing divisions on controversial issues and discredit key political figures like Vice President Harris and, to a much lesser extent, former President Donald Trump. \nAs Insikt Group continues to track growing concerns regarding election security and integrity, Operation Overload will likely amplify conspiracy theories around voter fraud and rigged elections, posing as legitimate media, to undermine confidence in the democratic process. \nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.","enclosure":{"url":"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/format_webp/operation_overload_impersonates_media_influence_2024_US_election_e3c66bba5d.jpg","length":"0","type":"image/jpg"},"content":"Discover how Operation Overload, a Russia-aligned campaign, uses fake news and AI-generated audio to manipulate the 2024 US election.

The USSS is a dual-mission agency, responsible for both protection and investigations. This dual mandate and limited resources create a complex operational environment. A comparison of <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2022-03/U.S.%20Secret%20Service_Remediated.pdf\">USSS funding</a> and <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-03/fbi_fy_24_pb_bud_sum_ii_omb_cleared_3-08-23.pdf\">FBI funding</a> highlights a significant resource gap (for context, USSS <a href=\"https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classification-qualifications/general-schedule-qualification-standards/1800/criminal-investigation-series-1811/\">special agents</a> total ~4k compared to FBI special agents, who number ~14k). </p><p>Limited resources become detrimental given the demands of criminal investigations (e.g., <a href=\"https://www.secretservice.gov/newsroom/releases/2023/05/secret-service-state-department-offer-10-million-dollar-reward\">fraud and cybercrime</a>), added to continuous protection mandates (<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/list/secret-service-code-names-of-11-us-presidents\">POTUS</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/itm/272109285312\">VPOTUS</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Former_Presidents_Act\">former POTUSes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/ca/listing/1205067395/usss-dpd-us-secret-service-dignitary\">visiting foreign dignitaries</a>, <a href=\"https://www.secretservice.gov/protection/events\">national events</a>, etc.), which require significant capital and human assets. The USSS is successful in its mission because it excels at planning and logistics. The last resort, bodyguarding, generally only occurs due to suboptimal riz. Unlike digital systems downtime, which we <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/business/crowdstrike-microsoft-outage-corporate-workers.html\">generally accept</a> happens, the risk tolerance for an adverse event in a protective mission is roughly zero. </p><p>This is where former POTUS Trumps Pennsylvania rally becomes relevant. To address agent staffing demands, the USSS regularly partners with local, state, and federal law enforcement to protect outer perimeters during events. In addition to boosting numbers, these partnerships bring additional expertise, such as in-depth knowledge of the local environment, high-risk tactical units (SWAT), canine handlers, <a href=\"https://www.clevelandtn.gov/275/SWAT-Explosive-Ordinance-Disposal-EOD-Tr\">EOD experts</a>, etc., that benefit the protective mission. However, coordinating technology (e.g., communications) is one area where complexity becomes challenging. </p><p>A command post often has to relay communications between agencies that may use different equipment, encryption protocols, etc. This dynamic creates delays and, at the risk of speculation, may have contributed to the hesitation of USSS sniper teams attempting to assess the nature of a suspect on a roof where other agencies were actively working. </p><p>While USSS advance agents (for both trips and individual sites) are incredibly detail-oriented, even the pre-event briefings with combined agencies can create confusion, as there are different standard operating procedures (e.g., rules of engagement, arresting authority, etc.). The physical security environment becomes inherently more complex as additional agencies and departments are added to the mix. Too much complexity reduces riz. </p><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/b6099c50_702a_4452_a7f5_867ec18704e9_1410x840_7ec682f82b.webp\" alt=\"b6099c50-702a-4452-a7f5-867ec18704e9_1410x840.webp\"></p><p><em>A visual approximation of a physical security scenario with high complexity and lower resilience.</em></p><h2 id=\"using-the-tools-cone-of-plausibility-and-pestle\">Using the Tools: Cone of Plausibility and PESTLE</h2><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/14152740_2a6f_435e_8fc5_df607f23c4f5_1024x1024_cbd553c302.webp\" alt=\"14152740-2a6f-435e-8fc5-df607f23c4f5_1024x1024.webp\"></p><p>Mental scaffolding helps create confidence in evaluating potential outcomesroutine events and <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blackswan.asp\">black swans</a>to ultimately assess trade-offs in complexity and resilience.

Naturally, additional resilience may also result in greater complexity. \nIn security, organizations can measure resilience by recognizing solution complexity as an essential cost before investing resources. \n\nA visual approximation of an operational technology scenario with low complexity and resilience.\n[2] U.S. Secret Service (USSS) Physical Protection: High-Complexity Scenarios\nWhen the news of the failed assassination attempt of former President Trump (and the deaths of innocent bystanders) started lighting up peoples phones, friends and family were quick to text me, asking for an explanation related to how such a scenario was possible. \nDrawing from my experience as a former U.S. Secret Service (USSS) Agent, I can provide some small insights into the complexity of protective operations. The USSS is a dual-mission agency, responsible for both protection and investigations. This dual mandate and limited resources create a complex operational environment. A comparison of USSS funding and FBI funding highlights a significant resource gap (for context, USSS special agents total ~4k compared to FBI special agents, who number ~14k). \nLimited resources become detrimental given the demands of criminal investigations (e.g., fraud and cybercrime), added to continuous protection mandates (POTUS, VPOTUS, former POTUSes, visiting foreign dignitaries, national events, etc.), which require significant capital and human assets. The USSS is successful in its mission because it excels at planning and logistics. The last resort, bodyguarding, generally only occurs due to suboptimal riz. Unlike digital systems downtime, which we generally accept happens, the risk tolerance for an adverse event in a protective mission is roughly zero. \nThis is where former POTUS Trumps Pennsylvania rally becomes relevant. To address agent staffing demands, the USSS regularly partners with local, state, and federal law enforcement to protect outer perimeters during events. In addition to boosting numbers, these partnerships bring additional expertise, such as in-depth knowledge of the local environment, high-risk tactical units (SWAT), canine handlers, EOD experts, etc., that benefit the protective mission. However, coordinating technology (e.g., communications) is one area where complexity becomes challenging. \nA command post often has to relay communications between agencies that may use different equipment, encryption protocols, etc. This dynamic creates delays and, at the risk of speculation, may have contributed to the hesitation of USSS sniper teams attempting to assess the nature of a suspect on a roof where other agencies were actively working. \nWhile USSS advance agents (for both trips and individual sites) are incredibly detail-oriented, even the pre-event briefings with combined agencies can create confusion, as there are different standard operating procedures (e.g., rules of engagement, arresting authority, etc.). The physical security environment becomes inherently more complex as additional agencies and departments are added to the mix. Too much complexity reduces riz. \n\nA visual approximation of a physical security scenario with high complexity and lower resilience.\nUsing the Tools: Cone of Plausibility and PESTLE\n\nMental scaffolding helps create confidence in evaluating potential outcomesroutine events and black swansto ultimately assess trade-offs in complexity and resilience. In security, resilience cannot be measured solely by internal metrics. As complexity grows, so too does the need for structured thinking. This is where the Cone of Plausibility and PESTLE excel as frameworks, helping professionals make informed decisions that ultimately safeguard business continuity. \nPESTLE (Political, Economic, Sociological, Technological, Legal, and Environmental) helps broaden the scope of analysis, ensuring that organizations dont just focus on internal factors but also account for the broader context that influences resilience.\nThe Cone of Plausibility is used to assess a range of future scenarios by staging different possible outcomes. SecAlliance has a helpful write-up (with examples) on how PESTLE-M (+Military) feeds the cone in cyber threat intelligence (CTI). \nThe scenario designations wildcard, plausible, and baseline are helpful labels that decision-makers can consistently anticipate. Additionally, these scenarios lack conclusions, thus avoiding leading the witness and allowing consumers to formulate their own derivative risk implications.  \nWestern business implications from accelerating geopolitical tensions with China present an interesting cone exercise (twenty-year time horizon). Specifically, the cyber scenarios involve potential solutions with significant trade-offs in complexity and resilience. \nRisk Management\nThere are no right answers in complexity/resilience trade-offs. Organizations need better processes to evaluate equities and soberly manage risks. Sometimes, the riz juice isnt worth the squeeze, but everyone should understand the choices. \nA special thank you to Rosie Hampton, Dylan Davis, and Megan Keeling for a lovely walk and discussion of these topics.","enclosure":{"url":"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/0236694f_85c8_4620_992b_87418c1e77af_1024x1024_50f79706bb.webp","length":"0","type":"image/webp"},"content":"How Complexity Influences Security Outcomes in a Volatile World","contentSnippet":"How Complexity Influences Security Outcomes in a Volatile World","guid":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/the-resilience-dilemma","categories":["Blog"],"isoDate":"2024-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","tag":"intel"},{"title":"Hispanic Heritage Month: Path to Collective Power - A Three Part Series","link":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/erg-stories-hispanic-heritage-month-2024","pubDate":"Fri, 11 Oct 2024 00:00:00 GMT","content:encoded":"<p>This year, our Hispanic Heritage Month program will feature a three-part series led by <a href=\"https://notainclusion.com/\">Nota Inclusion</a> speakers.

UsingRecorded Future&#39;s Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified Rhysida victims an average of 30 days before they appeared on public extortion sites, offering a critical window to prevent ransomware deployment and mitigate damage. The infrastructure includes typosquatted domains, SEO poisoning, and C2 infrastructure for post-exfiltration activities. CleanUpLoader, commonly disguised as a software installer, aids Rhysida in data exfiltration and persistence. Notably, Rhysida targets sectors like healthcare and education, and focuses on both Windows and Linux-based systems. </p><h2 id=\"rhysida-ransomware-crawls-into-systems-with-cleanuploader\">Rhysida Ransomware Crawls into Systems with CleanUpLoader</h2><p>Sophisticated ransomware groups such as Rhysida are significantly impacting organizations globally. This group has been active since January 2023 and has continuously evolved its tactics. Leveraging CleanUpLoader for post-exploitation, Rhysida has been observed crawling into systems, with the ultimate objective of causing significant damage.</p><p>In this detailed analysis, we will delve into how Rhysida uses its multi-tiered infrastructure and CleanUpLoader to execute ransomware attacks and how Recorded Futures Network Intelligence has proven crucial in early detection.</p><h3 id=\"rhysidas-attack-strategy\">Rhysidas Attack Strategy</h3><p>Like many modern ransomware groups, Rhysida uses a multi-tiered infrastructure to carry out its attacks. Insikt Groups latest analysis, supported by Recorded Futures Network Intelligence, reveals how Rhysida uses its infrastructure to execute the early phases of the attack.</p><p>By creating typosquatted domains resembling popular software download sites, Rhysida tricks users into downloading infected files. This technique is particularly effective when coupled with SEO poisoning, in which these domains are ranked higher in search engine results, making them appear as legitimate download sources. Once a user clicks on one of these malicious domains, they are redirected to a payload server hosting CleanUpLoader, which is then used by the attacker during the post-exploitation phase. </p><h3 id=\"cleanuploader\">CleanUpLoader</h3><p>CleanUpLoader is a versatile backdoor malware used by Rhysida in its attack campaigns. This malware was primarily seen delivered as fake installers for popular software, such as Microsoft Teams and Google Chrome, making it more likely that targets unknowingly install it. CleanUpLoader not only facilitates persistence but also enables Rhysida actors to exfiltrate valuable data before ransomware deployment.</p><p>With multiple C2 domains built into its configuration, CleanUpLoader ensures redundancy, allowing it to maintain operations even if one C2 server is taken offline. The backdoor communicates with its command-and-control (C2) servers via HTTPS.</p><h3 id=\"rhysidas-victim-profile\">Rhysidas Victim Profile</h3><p>Rhysidas ransomware operations are global and affect a wide range of sectors, with the government and public sector being prime targets. These sectors have been particularly vulnerable due to their highly sensitive data and often insufficient security measures.</p><p>High-profile breaches include the attack on King Edward VIIs Hospital in London in 2023, where Rhysida claimed to have stolen sensitive information from hospital staff and patients, including members of the British royal family. Additionally, attacks on the Chilean Army and the City of Columbus demonstrate Rhysidas ability to infiltrate critical public sector infrastructures.</p><p>One of the group&#39;s distinguishing traits is its willingness to attack sectors that were previously off-limits for ransomware groups, including schools and hospitals. This represents a significant shift in ransomware ethics, signaling a more ruthless approach from modern threat actors.</p><h3 id=\"recorded-futures-early-detection\">Recorded Futures Early Detection</h3><p>Recorded Futures Network Intelligence&#39;s early detection capabilities have proven to be a game-changer in combating ransomware. Insikt Group identified that Rhysida victims could be detected on average 30 days before appearing on public extortion sites.

UsingRecorded Future's Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified Rhysida victims an average of 30 days before they appeared on public extortion sites, offering a critical window to prevent ransomware deployment and mitigate damage. The infrastructure includes typosquatted domains, SEO poisoning, and C2 infrastructure for post-exfiltration activities. CleanUpLoader, commonly disguised as a software installer, aids Rhysida in data exfiltration and persistence. Notably, Rhysida targets sectors like healthcare and education, and focuses on both Windows and Linux-based systems. \nRhysida Ransomware Crawls into Systems with CleanUpLoader\nSophisticated ransomware groups such as Rhysida are significantly impacting organizations globally. This group has been active since January 2023 and has continuously evolved its tactics. Leveraging CleanUpLoader for post-exploitation, Rhysida has been observed crawling into systems, with the ultimate objective of causing significant damage.\nIn this detailed analysis, we will delve into how Rhysida uses its multi-tiered infrastructure and CleanUpLoader to execute ransomware attacks and how Recorded Futures Network Intelligence has proven crucial in early detection.\nRhysidas Attack Strategy\nLike many modern ransomware groups, Rhysida uses a multi-tiered infrastructure to carry out its attacks. Insikt Groups latest analysis, supported by Recorded Futures Network Intelligence, reveals how Rhysida uses its infrastructure to execute the early phases of the attack.\nBy creating typosquatted domains resembling popular software download sites, Rhysida tricks users into downloading infected files. This technique is particularly effective when coupled with SEO poisoning, in which these domains are ranked higher in search engine results, making them appear as legitimate download sources. Once a user clicks on one of these malicious domains, they are redirected to a payload server hosting CleanUpLoader, which is then used by the attacker during the post-exploitation phase. \nCleanUpLoader\nCleanUpLoader is a versatile backdoor malware used by Rhysida in its attack campaigns. This malware was primarily seen delivered as fake installers for popular software, such as Microsoft Teams and Google Chrome, making it more likely that targets unknowingly install it. CleanUpLoader not only facilitates persistence but also enables Rhysida actors to exfiltrate valuable data before ransomware deployment.\nWith multiple C2 domains built into its configuration, CleanUpLoader ensures redundancy, allowing it to maintain operations even if one C2 server is taken offline. The backdoor communicates with its command-and-control (C2) servers via HTTPS.\nRhysidas Victim Profile\nRhysidas ransomware operations are global and affect a wide range of sectors, with the government and public sector being prime targets. These sectors have been particularly vulnerable due to their highly sensitive data and often insufficient security measures.\nHigh-profile breaches include the attack on King Edward VIIs Hospital in London in 2023, where Rhysida claimed to have stolen sensitive information from hospital staff and patients, including members of the British royal family. Additionally, attacks on the Chilean Army and the City of Columbus demonstrate Rhysidas ability to infiltrate critical public sector infrastructures.\nOne of the group's distinguishing traits is its willingness to attack sectors that were previously off-limits for ransomware groups, including schools and hospitals. This represents a significant shift in ransomware ethics, signaling a more ruthless approach from modern threat actors.\nRecorded Futures Early Detection\nRecorded Futures Network Intelligence's early detection capabilities have proven to be a game-changer in combating ransomware. Insikt Group identified that Rhysida victims could be detected on average 30 days before appearing on public extortion sites. Monitoring Rhysidas infrastructure, including typosquatting domains and CleanUpLoader C2 servers, made this detection possible.\nThe average dwell time between initial infection and ransomware deployment offers defenders a critical window to respond. By identifying network communications and otherindicators of compromise (IoCs) early, security teams can act swiftly to neutralize threats before the attackers can encrypt data or issue ransom demands.\nProactive Defense: Key Takeaways\nGiven the sophistication of Rhysidas operations, defending against such ransomware requires a proactive and intelligence-driven approach. Recorded Future's Network Intelligence offers visibility into ransomware groups infrastructure, providing defenders with crucial insights into their tools, tactics, and procedures.\nHere are key defensive strategies against Rhysida:\nAdvanced threat detection: Use early indicators of compromise and detection rules for custom file scanning and detection in logs to identify and respond to threats.\nNetwork Intelligence: Leverage Recorded Future Network Intelligence for early exfiltration detection, preventing ransomware escalation, using proactive infrastructure discovery by Insikt Group and extensive network traffic analysis.\nUser Training: Educate employees around malicious downloads, as these remain primary methods of infection.Patch Management: Ensure all systems are updated with the latest security patches to prevent exploits of known vulnerabilities.\nBackups: Regularly back up critical data and ensure those backups are stored securely, preferably offline, to mitigate the impact of ransomware.\nOutlook\nRhysida ransomware presents a significant threat across industries, with its use of CleanUpLoader making its operations highly effective and difficult to detect. However, with early detection methods such as those provided by Recorded Futures Network Intelligence, security teams can gain a crucial advantage, identifying victims well before ransomware deployment.\nAs ransomware threats continue to evolve, proactive monitoring of adversary infrastructure and the use of comprehensive intelligence solutions are essential in protecting organizations from devastating attacks. By understanding Rhysidas tactics, security teams can implement more effective defensive strategies to mitigate the impact of this and other advanced ransomware families.\nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.","enclosure":{"url":"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/Outmaneuvering_Rhysida_main_01e6ed62f0.webp","length":"0","type":"image/webp"},"content":"Discover how Rhysida ransomware leverages multi-tiered infrastructure, CleanUp Loader C2s, and SEO poisoning.

This is evident in both the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) and the second version of the Network and Information Systems Directive (NIS2).\nWhat is DORA?\nDORA establishes technical standards for EU member states to adopt as it relates to covered entities and their critical third-party Information & Communications Technology (ICT) providers across EU member states. ICT is considered to be so influential and essential to economic development and business growth that it has been credited with ushering in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. However, this reliance on ICT means that organizations must focus on digital resilience to minimize risk of not being able to deliver critical and important services. \nWho Does DORA Apply To?\nThe measures detailed by DORA will be applicable to both traditional and non-traditional financial entities operating in the EU and their ICT providers. ICT is broad and covers tools like cloud computing, software, hardware, transactions, communications, data, internet access, and more. \nWhy is DORA Being Implemented?\nThe increasing reliance on digital technologies in the financial sector has been heard loud and clear - thus DORA was proposed. DORA aims to make sure that financial institutions can withstand, respond to, and recover from ICT-related disruptions and threats. Ultimately the Act aims to elevate the operational resilience of financial entities, safeguard financial stability, and protect consumers from the adverse impacts of digital disruptions. \nImpact of Cyber Attacks on Financial Sector\nThe financial sector saw a dramatic increase in Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, with a 154% rise from 2022 to 2023. In EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) the financial services sector accounted for 66% of all DDoS attacks, compared with 28% in North America. This surge in DDoS attacks against EMEA financial services institutions is likely due to geopolitical tensions and hacktivist activities related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, making the financial sector the most targeted by these types of attacks.

CL0Ps MOVEit campaign garnered upwards of $100M in profit for the group, impacting over 2,750 organizations and 94 million individuals. It highlights the far-reaching impact software supply chain attacks can have.\nPillars of DORA\n\nICT Risk Management and Governance: DORA will seek to mandate that the managing body of an organization holds ultimate responsibility for overseeing ICT risk. It emphasizes the need for a well-documented ICT risk management framework to swiftly, efficiently, and comprehensively tackle both cyber and physical risks. \nIncident Response and Reporting: Organizations will be required to maintain documented systems for monitoring, managing, logging, classifying, and reporting ICT-related incidents. This ensures prompt and effective responses to any issues that arise. \nDigital Operational Resilience Testing: Financial institutions under DORA must regularly test their defenses and identify any vulnerabilities in their ICT systems. This proactive approach helps maintain robust protections against potential threats. \nThird-Party Risk Management: DORA seeks to impose  requirements not only for financial institutions, but also for their ICT providers. Critical ICT third-party service providers are often subject to oversight from relevant managing bodies. Financial firms should actively manage ICT third-party risks through contractual agreements and diligent oversight, ensuring a comprehensive risk management strategy to ensure compliance.\n\nWhat is NIS2?\nNIS2 aims to improve the cybersecurity capabilities across the EU by ensuring a high common level of cybersecurity across member states. NIS2 expands on the previous directive by addressing some gaps and shortcomings identified over the past few years.\nKey Changes Introduced by NIS2\nNIS2 introduces several significant changes aimed at enhancing cybersecurity measures and ensuring a more uniform implementation across the EU.

At the time, it appeared that global political efforts aimed at curbing spyware abuse were making significant progress. However, Insikt Groups recent findings point to a re-emergence of Predators infrastructure. New infrastructure tied to Predator was detected in multiple countries, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Angola.</p><p>This sophisticated spyware, primarily used by government actors, allows operators to infiltrate devices, gaining access to sensitive data like messages and contacts and even activating cameras and microphones without the users knowledge. </p><p><strong>Changes in Infrastructure and Evasion Tactics</strong></p><p>Predator&#39;s operators have significantly enhanced their infrastructure, adding layers of complexity to evade detection. The new infrastructure includes an additional tier in its multi-tiered delivery system, which anonymizes customer operations, making it even harder to identify which countries are using the spyware. This change makes it more difficult for researchers and cybersecurity defenders to track the spread of Predator.</p><p>Despite these changes, the mode of operation remains largely the same. The spyware likely continues to use both one-click and zero-click attack vectors, exploiting browser vulnerabilities and network access to install itself on targeted devices. Even though there are no reports of fully remote zero-click attacks, like those associated with Pegasus, Predator remains a dangerous tool in the hands of those targeting high-profile individuals.</p><p><strong>High-Profile Targets Remain at Risk</strong></p><p>One of the most concerning aspects of Predators return is its likely continued targeting of high-profile individuals. Politicians, executives, journalists, and activists are at the highest risk due to the intelligence value they hold for governments or other malicious actors. The costly licensing of Predator further suggests that operators reserve its use for strategic, high-value targets.</p><p>This widespread use of mercenary spyware, particularly against political opposition, has sparked concern in regions like the European Union. Investigations in Greece and Poland have already revealed how spyware has been used against opposition figures and journalists, raising serious questions about the legality and ethics of such surveillance.</p><p><strong>Best Practices for Defense</strong></p><p>Given Predator&#39;s renewed presence and the sophistication of its infrastructure, individuals and organizations must stay vigilant. Insikt Group has outlined several defensive measures that can help mitigate the risk of Predator spyware infiltration:</p><ol><li><strong>Regular Software Updates </strong> Keeping devices up to date with the latest security patches is crucial for reducing vulnerabilities that spyware like Predator exploits.</li><li><strong>Device Reboots </strong> Periodically rebooting devices can disrupt spyware operations, though it may not completely eliminate advanced spyware.</li><li><strong>Lockdown Mode </strong> Activating lockdown mode on devices can help block unauthorized access and exploitation attempts.</li><li><strong>Mobile Device Management (MDM) </strong> Implementing MDM systems allows organizations to manage and secure employee devices, ensuring they adhere to security protocols.</li><li><strong>Security Awareness Training </strong> Educating employees about spearphishing and other social engineering tactics can reduce the likelihood of falling victim to spyware attacks.</li></ol><p>These measures are particularly important for individuals in sensitive roles, such as those working in government, civil society, or corporate leadership positions.</p><p><strong>The Future of Spyware and Global Regulations</strong></p><p>Despite efforts to curb the use of spyware, the market for mercenary spyware is expected to grow. As demand for surveillance tools continues, more companies will likely emerge, developing new products and finding ways to bypass security defenses. The profitability of spyware and the competition within the industry make it likely that we will see even more sophisticated tools in the future.</p><p>In response to these threats, global efforts to regulate spyware continue. Investigations like those underway in the European Union may lead to stricter regulations on spyware sales and use. However, until significant international action is taken, Predator and similar tools will remain a persistent threat.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>The re-emergence of Predator spyware is a stark reminder of the growing dangers posed by mercenary spyware. While initial sanctions and public exposure seemed to have diminished its presence, recent developments show that Predator is still very much active. Its infrastructure has evolved, making it harder to track and identify users, but with the right cybersecurity practices in place, individuals and organizations can reduce their risk of becoming targets.</p><p>As the spyware market continues to expand, it is essential for governments and cybersecurity professionals to stay ahead of these threats. Public reporting, ongoing research, and stronger regulations are critical in minimizing the damage caused by tools like Predator.</p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2024-0905.pdf\">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p><h2>Appendix A  Indicators of Compromise</h2><table width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"font-family:Courier New;background-color:#ffffff;\"><strong>Domains:</strong><br>happytotstoys[.]com<br>holidaypriceguide[.]com<br>lesautreseux[.]com<br>masoloyakati[.]com<br>noisyball[.]com<br>nyirangongovrai[.]com<br>toysfourtots[.]com<br>yokananu[.]net<br><br><br><strong>IP Addresses:</strong><br>169.239.129[.]76<br>185.123.102[.]40<br>185.235.137[.]6<br>185.243.113[.]169<br>185.243.113[.]169<br>193.29.56[.]252<br>193.29.59[.]164<br>45.86.163[.]178<br>98.142.253[.]18<br></td></tr></tbody></table><p><br><br></p><h2>Appendix B  Mitre ATT&CK Techniques</h2><table>  <tr>   <td style=\"background-color:#0071CE;color:#ffffff;font-weight: 700;\"><strong>Tactic: Technique</strong></td>   <td style=\"background-color:#0071CE;color:#ffffff;font-weight: 700;\"><strong>ATT&CK Code</strong></td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td><strong>Resource Development: Acquire Infrastructure: Domains</strong></td>   <td><a href=\"https://app.recordedfuture.com/live/sc/entity/mitre:T1583.003\">T1583.001</a></td>  </tr>    <tr>   <td><strong>Resource Development: Acquire Infrastructure: Virtual Private Server</strong></td>   <td><a href=\"https://app.recordedfuture.com/live/sc/entity/mitre:T1584\">T1583.003</a></td>  </tr>    <tr>   <td><strong>Resource Development: Acquire Infrastructure: Server</strong></td>   <td><a href=\"https://app.recordedfuture.com/live/sc/entity/mitre:T1595.002\">T1583.004</a></td>  </tr>    <tr>   <td><strong>Initial Access: Spearphishing Link</strong></td>   <td><a href=\"https://app.recordedfuture.com/live/sc/entity/mitre:T1190\">T1566.002</a></td>  </tr></table>","content:encodedSnippet":"Following exposure and sanctions by the US government, Intellexas Predator spyware activity appeared to decline.

Even though there are no reports of fully remote zero-click attacks, like those associated with Pegasus, Predator remains a dangerous tool in the hands of those targeting high-profile individuals.\nHigh-Profile Targets Remain at Risk\nOne of the most concerning aspects of Predators return is its likely continued targeting of high-profile individuals. Politicians, executives, journalists, and activists are at the highest risk due to the intelligence value they hold for governments or other malicious actors. The costly licensing of Predator further suggests that operators reserve its use for strategic, high-value targets.\nThis widespread use of mercenary spyware, particularly against political opposition, has sparked concern in regions like the European Union. Investigations in Greece and Poland have already revealed how spyware has been used against opposition figures and journalists, raising serious questions about the legality and ethics of such surveillance.\nBest Practices for Defense\nGiven Predator's renewed presence and the sophistication of its infrastructure, individuals and organizations must stay vigilant. Insikt Group has outlined several defensive measures that can help mitigate the risk of Predator spyware infiltration:\n\nRegular Software Updates  Keeping devices up to date with the latest security patches is crucial for reducing vulnerabilities that spyware like Predator exploits.\nDevice Reboots  Periodically rebooting devices can disrupt spyware operations, though it may not completely eliminate advanced spyware.\nLockdown Mode  Activating lockdown mode on devices can help block unauthorized access and exploitation attempts.\nMobile Device Management (MDM)  Implementing MDM systems allows organizations to manage and secure employee devices, ensuring they adhere to security protocols.\nSecurity Awareness Training  Educating employees about spearphishing and other social engineering tactics can reduce the likelihood of falling victim to spyware attacks.\n\nThese measures are particularly important for individuals in sensitive roles, such as those working in government, civil society, or corporate leadership positions.\nThe Future of Spyware and Global Regulations\nDespite efforts to curb the use of spyware, the market for mercenary spyware is expected to grow. As demand for surveillance tools continues, more companies will likely emerge, developing new products and finding ways to bypass security defenses. The profitability of spyware and the competition within the industry make it likely that we will see even more sophisticated tools in the future.\nIn response to these threats, global efforts to regulate spyware continue. Investigations like those underway in the European Union may lead to stricter regulations on spyware sales and use. However, until significant international action is taken, Predator and similar tools will remain a persistent threat.\nConclusion\nThe re-emergence of Predator spyware is a stark reminder of the growing dangers posed by mercenary spyware. While initial sanctions and public exposure seemed to have diminished its presence, recent developments show that Predator is still very much active. Its infrastructure has evolved, making it harder to track and identify users, but with the right cybersecurity practices in place, individuals and organizations can reduce their risk of becoming targets.\nAs the spyware market continues to expand, it is essential for governments and cybersecurity professionals to stay ahead of these threats. Public reporting, ongoing research, and stronger regulations are critical in minimizing the damage caused by tools like Predator.\nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.\nAppendix A  Indicators of Compromise\n\nDomains:\nhappytotstoys[.]com\nholidaypriceguide[.]com\nlesautreseux[.]com\nmasoloyakati[.]com\nnoisyball[.]com\nnyirangongovrai[.]com\ntoysfourtots[.]com\nyokananu[.]net\n\nIP Addresses:\n169.239.129[.]76\n185.123.102[.]40\n185.235.137[.]6\n185.243.113[.]169\n185.243.113[.]169\n193.29.56[.]252\n193.29.59[.]164\n45.86.163[.]178\n98.142.253[.]18\n\n\n\n\nAppendix B  Mitre ATT&CK Techniques\n  \n   Tactic: Technique   ATT&CK Code  \n  \n   Resource Development: Acquire Infrastructure: Domains   T1583.001  \n    \n   Resource Development: Acquire Infrastructure: Virtual Private Server   T1583.003  \n    \n   Resource Development: Acquire Infrastructure: Server   T1583.004  \n    \n   Initial Access: Spearphishing Link   T1566.002","enclosure":{"url":"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/Main_Feature_1_8737d57c1c.webp","length":"0","type":"image/webp"},"content":"Intellexa’s Predator spyware infrastructure re-emerges after sanctions.

with  Mint Sandstorm, Charming Kitten, and APT42. Targeting US political and government entities, GreenCharlie utilizes sophisticated phishing operations and malware like GORBLE and POWERSTAR. The group's infrastructure, which includes domains registered with dynamic DNS (DDNS) providers, enables the groups phishing attacks.\nGreenCharlies Persistent Threat\nSince June 2024, Insikt Group has tracked infrastructure linked to GreenCharlie, an Iran-nexus cyber threat group with connections to Mint Sandstorm, Charming Kitten, and APT42. Insikt Group analysis linked GreenCharlie infrastructure to malware which is reported to have been used to target US political campaign officials, government entities, and strategic assets. \nGreenCharlie is associated with malware, including POWERSTAR (also known as CharmPower and GorjolEcho) and GORBLE, the latter of which was identified by Google-Mandiant. Both GORBLE and POWERSTAR are variants of the same malware family, designed to enable espionage activity via spearphishing campaigns. \nIran and its associated cyber-espionage actors have consistently demonstrated both the intent and capability to engage in influence and interference operations targeting US elections and domestic information spaces. These campaigns are likely to continue utilizing hack-and-leak tactics aimed at undermining or supporting political candidates, influencing voter behavior, and fostering discord.\nThe groups infrastructure is meticulously crafted, utilizing dynamic DNS (DDNS) providers like Dynu, DNSEXIT, and Vitalwerks to register domains used in phishing attacks. These domains often employ deceptive themes related to cloud services, file sharing, and document visualization to lure targets into revealing sensitive information or downloading malicious files.\nRecorded Futures Network Intelligence has identified multiple Iran-based IP addresses communicating with GreenCharlies infrastructure. The use of ProtonVPN and ProtonMail further indicates an attempt to obfuscate the groups activities, a common tactic among Iranian APTs.\nGreenCharlies phishing operations are highly targeted, often employing social engineering techniques that exploit current events and political tensions. The group has registered numerous domains since May 2024, many of which are likely used for phishing activities. These domains are linked to DDNS providers, which allow for rapid changes in IP addresses, making it difficult to track the groups activities.\nThe malware deployed by GreenCharlie, including GORBLE and POWERSTAR, follows a multi-stage infection process. After initial access through phishing, the malware establishes communication with command-and-control (C2) servers, enabling the attackers to exfiltrate data or deliver additional payloads.\nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.\nAppendix A  Indicators of Compromise\n\nDomains:\nactiveeditor[.]info\npersonalwebview[.]info\nlonglivefreedom.ddns[.]net\nhugmefirstddd.ddns[.]net\nicenotebook.ddns[.]net\nsoftservicetel.ddns[.]net\nconfigtools.linkpc[.]net\nwebviewerpage[.]info\nwww.selfpackage[.]info\nselfpackage[.]info\nitemselectionmode[.]info\ntermsstatement.duckdns[.]org\nmobiletoolssdk.dns-dynamic[.]net\nresearchdocument[.]info\ntimelinepage.dns-dynamic[.]net\nsearchstatistics.duckdns[.]org\nmessagepending[.]info\nwww.chatsynctransfer[.]info\nsynctimezone.dns-dynamic[.]net\nchatsynctransfer[.]info\ntimezone-update.duckdns[.]org\nonetimestorage[.]info\ntowerreseller.dns-dynamic[.]net\ntranslatorupdater.dns-dynamic[.]net\napi.overall-continuing[.]site\nbackend.cheap-case[.]site\nadmin.cheap-case[.]site\ndemo.cheap-case[.]site\ndev.cheap-case[.]site\napp.cheap-case[.]site\napi.cheap-case[.]site\neditioncloudfiles.dns-dynamic[.]net\nfileeditiontools.linkpc[.]net\nentryconfirmation.duckdns[.]org\ndoceditor.duckdns[.]orgv\nprojectdrivevirtualcloud.co[.]uk\ncontinueresource.forumz[.]info\ndestinationzone.duia[.]eu\nonlinecloudzone[.]info\nstorageprovider.duia[.]eu\nlineeditor.32-b[.]it\nlineeditor.001www[.]com\nlineeditor.mypi[.]co\ndynamicrender.line[.]pm\nnextcloudzone.dns-dynamic[.]net\nrealpage.redirectme[.]net\nsharestoredocs.theworkpc[.]com\nthisismyapp.accesscam[.]org\nthisismydomain.chickenkiller[.]com\npagerendercloud.linkpc[.]net\nsplitviewer.linkpc[.]net\npageviewer.linkpc[.]net\npreparingdestination.fixip[.]org\njoincloud.mypi[.]co\njoincloud.duckdns[.]org\nrealcloud[.]info\ndirectfileinternal[.]info\nsourceusedirection.mypi[.]co\nviewdestination.vpndns[.]net\noverflow.duia[.]eu\ntracedestination.duia[.]eu\ncontinue.duia[.]eu\nlinereview.duia[.]eu\nhighlightsreview.line.pm\nnextcloud.duia[.]us\nsmartview.dns-dynamic.net\ncontentpreview.redirectme[.]net\nfinaledition.redirectme[.]net\ndynamictranslator.ddnsgeek[.]com\npersonalstoragebox.linkpc[.]net\npersonalcloudparent[.]info\ncloudarchive[.]info\ncloudregionpages[.]info\nstreaml23.duia[.]eu\npkglessplans[.]xyz\nworldstate.duia[.]us\ncallfeedback.duia[.]ro\nreviewedition.duia[.]eu\nfilereader.dns-dynamic[.]net\nvector.kozow[.]com\ncloudtools.duia[.]eu\nuptimezonemetadta.run[.]place\ndocumentcloudeditor.ddnsgeek[.]com\ncoldwarehexahash.dns-dynamic[.]net\nreadquickarticle.dns-dynamic[.]net\nuptime-timezone.dns-dynamic[.]net\nIP Addresses:\n185.241.61[.]86\n172.86.77[.]85\n146.70.95[.]251\n91.232.105[.]185\n54.39.143[.]112\n38.180.91[.]213\n38.180.123[.]135\n38.180.123[.]113\n38.180.123[.]187\n38.180.146[.]214\n38.180.146[.]212\n38.180.146[.]194\n38.180.146[.]174\n38.180.123[.]231\n38.180.123[.]234\n38.180.146[.]252\n37.1.194[.]250\nIran-based IP Addresses:\n193.111.236[.]130\n185.143.233[.]120\n94.74.175[.]209 \n94.74.145[.]184 \n93.119.48[.]60\n37.148.63[.]24\n37.255.251[.]17 \n5.106.153[.]245\n5.106.169[.]235 \n5.106.185[.]98 \n5.106.202[.]101 \n5.106.219[.]243\nMalware Hash:\nC3486133783379e13ed37c45dc6645cbee4c1c6e62e7988722931eef99c8eaf3\n33a61ff123713da26f45b399a9828e29ad25fbda7e8994c954d714375ef92156\n4ac088bf25d153ec2b9402377695b15a28019dc8087d98bd34e10fed3424125f\n\n\n            \n\n\nAppendix B  Mitre ATT&CK Techniques\n\nTactic: TechniqueATT&CK Code\nResource Development: Acquire Infrastructure: DomainsT1583.001\nResource Development: Establish Accounts: Email Accounts T1585.002\nInitial Access: Spearphishing AttachmentT1566.001\nInitial Access: Spearphishing LinkT1566.002\nExecution: Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShellT1059.001\nExecution: Command and Scripting Interpreter: Unix ShellT1059.004\nPersistence: Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys/Startup FolderT1547.001 \nPersistence: Scheduled Task/Job: Scheduled TaskT1053.005\n    \nDiscovery: System Information DiscoveryT1082\nDiscovery: Process DiscoveryT1057\n    \nCommand and Control: Application Layer Protocol: Web ProtocolsT1071.001","enclosure":{"url":"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/greencharlie_infrastructure_linked_us_political_campaign_targeting_07328802cc.webp","length":"0","type":"image/webp"},"content":"Explore GreenCharlie’s expanding cyber threat against US political and government entities.

The broad use of Iranian drones across regional conflicts almost certainly reflects the strategic prioritization  at the highest levels of the Iranian government  of developing, producing, and proliferating these systems.\nCompliance and Reputational Risks\nIrans production of drones relies heavily on an evolving global network to procure foreign-made components. This network exposes Western defense and manufacturing companies to compliance violations and reputational harm. By acquiring components through illicit means, Iran circumvents international sanctions and integrates Western technology into its drones. Businesses must therefore maintain robust compliance programs and stay vigilant about the red flags associated with Iranian procurement tactics.\nTechnology Transfer and Cybersecurity Risks\nIrans ability to domestically reproduce foreign technology poses a significant threat. By reverse-engineering Western components, Iran undermines the effectiveness of export controls and sanctions. Moreover, Iranian cyber-espionage capabilities present an ongoing threat to Western defense contractors. Iranian APT groups are likely targeting companies involved in aerospace and drone technology to advance their own capabilities.\nGlobal Proliferation of Iranian Drones\nThe global expansion of Iranian drone exports and production is particularly concerning. Irans partnerships, notably with Russia, enhance the capabilities of both countries drone programs. Iran's drones have been used in conflicts across European, African, and South American theaters, demonstrating their strategic importance. Most notably, the collaboration between Iran and Russia in drone production has significantly boosted Moscows ability to destroy critical infrastructure in Ukraine.\nMitigation Strategies for Businesses and Governments\nTo counter these threats, businesses should implement comprehensive compliance programs, educate employees on illicit procurement practices, and strengthen cybersecurity measures. Governments must enhance their analytical resources to identify and target entities supporting Irans drone industry. International collaboration and consistent enforcement of export controls are crucial to mitigating the proliferation and development of Iranian drones.\nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.","enclosure":{"url":"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/format_webp/Main_Feature_8_def923a1de.jpg","length":"0","type":"image/jpg"},"content":"The physical threat of Iranian-made unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, has been evident in conflict zones over Israel, the Red Sea, and Ukraine.","contentSnippet":"The physical threat of Iranian-made unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, has been evident in conflict zones over Israel, the Red Sea, and Ukraine.","guid":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/production-and-proliferation-risks-burgeoning-iranian-drone-industry","categories":["Research (Insikt)"],"isoDate":"2024-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","tag":"intel"},{"title":"Recent Incidents Have CISOs — and Everyone Else — Talking","link":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/recent-incidents-have-cisos-talking","pubDate":"Wed, 31 Jul 2024 00:00:00 GMT","content:encoded":"<h1 id=\"recent-incidents-have-cisos--and-everyone-else--talking\">Recent Incidents Have CISOs  and Everyone Else  Talking</h1><p>Unfortunately, we regularly see companies digitally compromised with associated massive data breaches.

I was recently in Singapore, engaging in a fireside chat with the esteemed <a href=\"https://www.nets.com.sg/newsroom/nets-appoints-john-yong-as-non-executive-independent-director\">John Yong</a>. John, a seasoned expert in security practice, policy, and administration, currently serves in multiple oversight/governance roles. During our conversation, John emphasized that any threat report or narrative that fails to adequately capture volume and velocity is, in his view, a C- at best. As he put it, its a $10 story. The security industry, he believes, needs better resources to consistently develop $1M stories. </p><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/939e3fca_764d_48a5_8f68_acb2ce2076c9_1600x1331_03e7875171.webp\" alt=\"939e3fca-764d-48a5-8f68-acb2ce2076c9_1600x1331.webp\"></p><h2 id=\"volume--velocity\">Volume &amp; Velocity</h2><p>Johns grading assessment underscores the importance of volume and velocity in convincing readers of the necessity for action. Simply put, volume represents the magnitude of change, while velocity highlights how quickly the change has occurred.

Great cyber intelligence will provide this context, similar to the business intelligence financial traders require to execute trades while monitoring financial markets. Professional traders who ignore volume and velocity do so at their peril.

While this is good news for Wall Street favorites like Nvidia, CIOs should look for the second-order business, technology, and security implications of the proliferation of GenAI-enabled hardware. </p><p>One apparent second-order effect is the increased adoption of Arm semiconductors, which is potentially less considered in this local AI hardware movement.

However, we can already see threat actors taking an interest in exploits, and the volume will likely increase as Arm chips proliferate in mainstream computing platforms.

I was recently in Singapore, engaging in a fireside chat with the esteemed John Yong. John, a seasoned expert in security practice, policy, and administration, currently serves in multiple oversight/governance roles. During our conversation, John emphasized that any threat report or narrative that fails to adequately capture volume and velocity is, in his view, a C- at best. As he put it, its a $10 story. The security industry, he believes, needs better resources to consistently develop $1M stories. \n\nVolume & Velocity\nJohns grading assessment underscores the importance of volume and velocity in convincing readers of the necessity for action. Simply put, volume represents the magnitude of change, while velocity highlights how quickly the change has occurred. As cybersecurity professionals, our data-driven discussions are powerful influencers toward a desired outcome, often leading to buy-in on new security control investments. \nVolume and velocity are the two variables that underpin a compelling threat implication. Great cyber intelligence will provide this context, similar to the business intelligence financial traders require to execute trades while monitoring financial markets. Professional traders who ignore volume and velocity do so at their peril. The same applies to cyber security and intelligence leaders, whether they know it or not. \nLets review a few examples where volume and velocity create different enterprise recommendations. \nArm Exploit Volume\nIn a recent Bloomberg interview, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella revealed that Microsoft is all in on manufacturing hardware (personal computers) optimized for GenAI to enable local/edge-accessible capabilities. Others, like Dell, echo their intent to move quickly to the same destination. While this is good news for Wall Street favorites like Nvidia, CIOs should look for the second-order business, technology, and security implications of the proliferation of GenAI-enabled hardware. \nOne apparent second-order effect is the increased adoption of Arm semiconductors, which is potentially less considered in this local AI hardware movement. What are the potential security considerations as workstations move from using Intels traditional x86 architected semiconductors to Arm? Are CISOs developing recommendations? How do volume and velocity factor in? Lets find out.\n\nWhen performing Recorded Future platform searches, specific memory registers and exploit framework library syntax enable differentiated selectors between Arm and x86 semiconductor architectures. The search results represent a sample of instructions or conversations (in multiple languages) related to the technical complexities of hacking ARM-based software (or hardware). In this case, we can remove references to CTF (Capture the Flag) events, commercial frameworks, or shared code (i.e., Metasploit or BishopFox) that perform the heavy lifting of exploit development. The remaining results capture less well-known exploit code. \n\nImage: Comparisons of Arm and x86 exploit code references, respectively, courtesy of Recorded Future.\nThe prior two years reveal consistent Arm-based and x86-based exploit code appearances, with recent spikes in May 2024. The sample size is relatively small, but visually, the increased volume of exploit references is apparent. Now, more discovery/analysis is needed to understand context and velocity.\n\nImage: Recorded Future LLM summarization of Arm exploit results.\nThe results primarily derive from GitHub and Hackyx, as well as a smattering of different foreign language forums and chat channels. \n\nImage: A 1000 yard stare meme overlaid on a buffer overflow example, possibly derived from code found at deephacking.tech.\nAs referenced in the Intelligence to Risk (I2R) framework, broad consumption of different event types creates more confidence in volume and velocity, which influences a threat implication and potential future associated risk recommendation. Open and closed-sourced code references provide an initial volume signal in this example. Additional data sourcing might also include honeynets and malware sample analysis. \nA ninety-day search through Triage for files that match Linux and Arm tags returns roughly 6000 results. Thats a relatively small number in the pantheon of daily malware processed, but file verdicts provide a different event source to track over time for significant changes in volume and velocity. \nArm taking a greater market share of global computing wont happen overnight. However, we can already see threat actors taking an interest in exploits, and the volume will likely increase as Arm chips proliferate in mainstream computing platforms. The gradual shift could create security implications that organizations want to proactively address, starting with endpoint defense and a review of commercial solutions. \nNetwork Exploit Velocity\nQuantifying velocity is as much about pattern recognition as the time change state between data points. As previously mentioned, China is actively exploiting network appliances for multiple reasons, and more defender effort is required as traditional host-based security solutions (i.e., AV/EDR/XDR) are rendered impotent. \nThe velocity component is relevant to address as it drives the movement level in attack proximity for any of the five risk impacts. A more significant east/west move in the proximity & resilience graph may drive more operational urgency, depending on the corresponding level of resilience. \n\nImage: An example of a Proximity & Resilience Graph\nCisco network appliances are a recent example of Chinas zero-day exploit targeting. The velocity of these exploits is challenging to determine (until its too late) without telemetry that extends beyond OSINT. \n\nImage: A vulnerability intelligence summary courtesy of Recorded Future.\nIn the timeline below, the distance between data points roughly represents velocity. In the subsequent graph, a volume change is represented across two different categories of vulnerabilities. A comprehensive search and verified results for applicable vulnerabilities with associated exploitation are a starting point, and ongoing signals from telemetry like darknets/honeypots can also provide more current and timely data toward an accurate velocity representation. Audiences should quickly identify the potential urgency attached to the threat, which dictates the speed of I2R pyramid traversal to ultimately implement recommendations. \n\nImage: A 2023 - 2024 timeline containing samples of network equipment exploitation courtesy of Recorded Future.\n\nImage: Cumulative cyber attack and exploit references to vulnerabilities divided between network appliances and enterprise software, courtesy of Dylan Davis and Recorded Future.\nSimilarly, Recorded Futures Insikt Group recently released a report on Threat Actor Group 100 (TAG-100, which is likely a state-sponsored group from a country that begins with  and ends with ), which has compromised organizations in over ten countries.

Enriching Other Security Technologies by Integrating Threat Intelligence</h3><p>These are the basics  integrating cyber threat intelligence into your already existing security processes improves decision-making for incident response and enhances your security policy. According to Gartner, cyber threat intelligence has recently begun to be widely incorporated into most security technology verticals, including security information and event management (SIEM), firewalls and unified <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/integrations/threat-intelligence-management\">threat management systems</a>, intrusion detection and prevention, secure web gateways and secure email gateways, endpoint protection, web application protection, distributed denial of service, vulnerability management, security orchestration, and more.</p><p>If your organization does not already include threat intelligence in its security program, a good place to start is by <strong>looking at what you are already using and seeing how threat intelligence can make it more effective</strong>. Many threat intelligence solutions offer machine-readable intelligence that can integrate frictionlessly with the security products you already use, and an increasing number of solutions are using open-source standards, making it easier than ever to share data across platforms.</p><h3 id=\"2-vulnerability-prioritization-for-security-teams\">2. Vulnerability Prioritization For Security Teams</h3><p>One of the best uses for an effective <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/threat-intelligence-program\">threat intelligence program</a> is to gather data and perform analysis that will help your organization create a simple metric for evaluating vulnerabilities. This metric should be a measure of the overlap between the problems you can fix and the solutions that will make the biggest difference, given the time and resources available to you.</p><p>The traditional approach to prioritizing vulnerabilities comes from the attitude that the best security approach is to patch everything, all the time, everywhere. Achieving this goal would, in theory, lead to a perfectly impenetrable system  but it sets an impossibly high standard. So organizations that follow this approach will inevitably make compromises and go after the biggest problems first.</p><p>But, contrary to popular belief, the biggest problems (based on how much damage they actually cause) are not issues like zero-day threats or clever new exploits, but the same old vulnerabilities that continue to be exploited, precisely because so many organizations prioritize new threats within their threat hunting instead of focusing on improving their fundamentals.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/threat-actors/threat-actor-types\">Threat actors</a> are just as limited  if not more so  by time and the resources available to them as you are.

This indicates that the vast majority of new exploits were variations on old ones  making it clear that any organizations top priority should be patching already-known vulnerabilities rather than worrying about new threats.</p><h3 id=\"3-open-deep-and-dark-web-monitoring\">3. Open, Deep, and Dark Web Monitoring</h3><p>A <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/threat-intelligence\">threat intelligence solution</a> should gather its threat data from both open and closed sources on the internet.</p><p>Open sources, in short, are publicly available to everyone on the internet.

Most of this information includes scientific, academic, or government reports, personal information like financial records or medical histories, and private company databases.</p><p>The dark web, which makes up the remaining six percent of all the data on the internet, is made up of websites that can only be reached through browsers like Tor, which provide encryption and anonymity.

Using AI and inauthentic websites, CopyCop creates and spreads political content. The network registered 120 new websites between May 10 and May 12, 2024, amplifying targeted content through platforms like YouTube. Despite a focus shift to US elections, CopyCop's AI-generated content has seen limited social media amplification. \nRussia-Linked CopyCop Expands to Cover US Elections, Target Political Leaders\nOn May 9, 2024, Insikt Group published an initial report on CopyCop, a likely Russian government-aligned influence network. CopyCop uses inauthentic websites and generative artificial intelligence (AI) to create and spread political content. Between May 10 and May 12, 2024, the network registered 120 new websites using similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). CopyCop has shifted its focus primarily to the 2024 United States (US) presidential election, disseminating targeted content through YouTube videos aimed at political leaders in France, Ukraine, and the European Union (EU).\nCopyCop has expanded its sources for influence content to include mainstream news outlets in the US and UK, conservative-leaning US media, and Russian state-affiliated media. Within 24 hours of the original articles being posted, CopyCop scrapes, modifies, and disseminates them to US election-themed websites using over 1,000 fake journalist personas. Despite the rapid content generation, the AI-generated content has seen limited amplification on social media.\nThe network has adapted to recent scrutiny by moving its infrastructure to US-based hosts, likely to minimize Russian government connections. Additionally, fewer traces of generative AI use indicate an attempt to obscure the use of large language models (LLMs).\nKey Findings\n\nCopyCop now targets the 2024 US elections, reducing content on other topics like Russias war against Ukraine and domestic politics in France and the UK.\nCopyCop registered 120 new websites between May 10 and May 12, 2024, focusing on US elections.\nThe network uses AI-generated content and fake journalist personas to spread modified articles from mainstream and conservative-leaning US media, as well as Russian state-affiliated outlets.\nNew French-themed and US election websites are publishing targeted, likely human-crafted content.\nAs of early June 2024, CopyCop's new AI-generated content has seen little to no amplification on social media.\nOver 1,000 distinct author profiles and LLM-generated text in article headlines indicate extensive use of AI.\n\nMitigations\n\nUse Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud to track and summarize emerging narratives across CopyCop websites.\nMonitor the spread of CopyCop content on social media and messaging platforms like Telegram.\nNews organizations should track and counteract plagiarized content to safeguard their reputation.\nUtilize Recorded Future Brand Intelligence to identify and address typosquatting domains and infringing content.\n\nInfluence networks using generative AI, like CopyCop, are likely to become more prominent ahead of the 2024 US elections, although they may not gain significant attention initially. Amplification of CopyCop content by existing influence networks is helping bring its content to existing audiences. Once these websites have established persistence, CopyCop will likely publish more targeted content hidden among the high volume of AI-generated content, making them harder to identify and parse out.

In fact, according to a <a href=\"https://futuremarketinsights.com/reports/open-source-intelligence-market\">report</a> by Future Market Insikt, the OSINT industry is predicted to reach a staggering $58 billion by 2033, highlighting its increasing importance and integration into various sectors.</p><p>If you have ever asked yourself What does OSINT stand for? What is open source intelligence (OSINT)? Or whats the OSINT meaning? Keep reading to find out.</p><p>In this blog post, were going to cover <strong>the fundamentals of Open Source Intelligence, or OSINT</strong>, including how its used, and the <a href=\"https://recordedfuture.com/blog/tactical-threat-intelligence\">tools and techniques</a> that can be employed to gather and analyze it. Well delve into what is OSINT, exploring the OSINT meaning and the significant role it plays in the realm of intelligence gathering.</p><h2 id=\"key-takeaways\">Key Takeaways</h2><ul><li><strong>Open source intelligence is derived from data and information that is available to the general public</strong>. Its not limited to what can be found using Google, although the so-called surface web is an important component.</li><li><strong>As valuable as open source intelligence can be, information overload is a real concern</strong>. Most of the tools and techniques used to conduct open source intelligence initiatives are designed to help security professionals (or threat actors) focus their efforts on specific areas of interest.</li><li><strong>There is a dark side to open source intelligence: anything that can be found by security professionals can also be found (and used) by threat actors</strong>.</li><li><strong>Having a clear strategy and framework in place for open source intelligence gathering is essential</strong>  simply looking for anything that could be interesting or useful will inevitably lead to burnout.</li><li><strong>Using OSINT tools to discover and protect sensitive data from potential attackers is crucial</strong> to reduce the risk of cybersecurity threats.</li></ul><h2 id=\"osint-meaning\">OSINT Meaning</h2><p>Before we look at common sources and applications of open source intelligence, its important to understand what it actually is.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title50/html/USCODE-2011-title50-chap15-subchapI-sec403-5.htm\">According</a> to U.S. public law, open source intelligence:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Is produced from publicly available information</strong></li><li><strong>Is collected, analyzed, and disseminated in a timely manner to an appropriate audience</strong></li><li><strong>Addresses a specific intelligence requirement</strong></li></ul><p>The important phrase to focus on here is publicly available.</p><p><strong>The term open source refers specifically to information that is available for public consumption</strong>. If any specialist skills, tools, or techniques are required to access a piece of information, it cant reasonably be considered open source.</p><br><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/what_is_osint_definition_0d760cc7c0.webp\" alt=\"What is OSINT? (Open Source Intelligence)\"></p><br><p>Crucially, open source information is not limited to what you can find using the major search engines. Web pages and other resources that can be found using Google certainly constitute massive sources of open source information, but they are far from the only sources.</p><p>For starters, a huge proportion of the internet (<a href=\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=_V8MGzvJEXY\">over 99 percent, according to former Google CEO Eric Schmidt</a>) cannot be found using the major search engines. This so-called deep web is a mass of websites, databases, files, and more that (for a variety of reasons, including the <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/dangers-of-exposed-login-panels\">presence of login pages</a> or paywalls) cannot be indexed by Google, Bing, Yahoo, or any other search engine you care to think of. Despite this, much of the content of the deep web can be considered open source because its readily available to the public.</p><p><strong>OSINT tools can be used to access and analyze information from sources beyond traditional search engines</strong>. These tools, such as Spiderfoot, searchcode, Searx, Twint, and Metagoofil, gather and analyze massive amounts of data from public and open sources, including social media networks and the deep web, to discover and store large quantities of data, find links and patterns among different pieces of information, and collate discovered information into actionable intelligence.</p><p>In addition, <strong>theres plenty of freely accessible information online that can be found using online tools other than traditional search engines</strong>. Well look at this more later on, but as a simple example, tools like <a href=\"https://securitytrails.com/\">SecurityTrails</a> and others can be used to find IP addresses, networks, open ports, webcams, printers, and pretty much anything else thats connected to the internet.</p><p><strong>Information can also be considered open source if it is:</strong></p><ul><li>Published or broadcast for a public audience (for example, news media content)</li><li>Available to the public by request (for example, census data)</li><li>Available to the public by subscription or purchase (for example, industry journals)</li><li>Could be seen or heard by any casual observer</li><li>Made available at a meeting open to the public</li><li>Obtained by visiting any place or attending any event that is open to the public</li></ul><p>At this point, youre probably thinking, Man, thats a lot of information </p><p>And youre right. Were talking about a truly unimaginable quantity of information that is growing at a far higher rate than anybody could ever hope to keep up with. Even if we narrow the field down to a single source of information  lets say Twitter  were forced to cope with <a href=\"http://internetlivestats.com/\">hundreds of millions of new data points every day</a>.</p><p>This, as youve probably gathered, is the inherent trade-off of open source intelligence.</p><h2 id=\"history-of-osint\">History of OSINT</h2><p>The term OSINT refers to the practice of collecting information from <a href=\"https://osintfoundation.com/osint/Standards.asp\">publicly available sources</a> to be used in an intelligence context. This practice has been around for a while, but its the digital era that really propelled OSINT into a league of its own.</p><p><strong>The foundational roots of OSINT are linked to the formation of the <a href=\"https://cia.gov/readingroom/sites/default/files/FBIS_history_part1_0.pdf\">Foreign Broadcast Monitoring Service (FBMS) back in 1941</a></strong>. This organization was charged with the significant role of scrutinizing international broadcast communications to identify any potential dubious activities.</p><p><a href=\"https://afio.com/publications/Schauer_Storger_Evo_of_OSINT_WINTERSPRING2013.pdf\">According</a> to the Association of Former Intelligence Officers (AFIO): <strong>The US military first coined the term OSINT in the late 1980s.</strong> This development stemmed from the recognition that intelligence reform was needed to effectively meet the rapidly changing informational demands, particularly at the tactical battlefield level.</p><p>Initially, OSINT was a tool used primarily by intelligence agencies and law enforcement to gather publicly available information to assist in national security and <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/threat-actors/cybercriminals\">cybercriminal</a> investigations. The methods involved were time-consuming, often requiring individuals to manually sift through public records, newspapers, and other documents to find relevant information. This manual gathering of information was often difficult due to the vast amount of data one had to sift through. However, <strong>as the web evolved, so did the methods of collecting and analyzing publicly available data</strong>.</p><p>The advent of the internet significantly amplified the means through which information could be collected. <strong>Suddenly, a wide range of data became publicly available and easily accessible online, from government reports to academic papers, and everything in-between</strong>. Websites became a primary data source for OSINT practitioners.

The intelligence community plays a crucial role in utilizing OSINT for national security and cybersecurity efforts. </p><br><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/osint_how_is_open_source_intelligence_used_991120581e.webp\" alt=\"How is Open Source Intelligence Used?\"></p><br><p>There are two common use cases:</p><h3 id=\"1-ethical-hacking-and-penetration-testing\">1. Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing</h3><p>Security professionals use open source intelligence to identify potential weaknesses in friendly networks so that they can be remediated before they are exploited by threat actors.

Identifying and protecting sensitive data is crucial to reduce the risk of cybersecurity threats.</li><li>Open ports or unsecured internet-connected devices</li><li>Unpatched software, such as websites running old versions of common CMS products</li><li>Leaked or exposed assets, such as proprietary code on pastebins</li></ul><h3 id=\"2-identifying-external-threats\">2. Identifying External Threats</h3><p>As weve discussed many times in the past, the internet is an excellent source of insights into an organizations most pressing <a href=\"https://recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/cyber-threats/emerging-threats\">emerging threats</a>. From identifying which new <a href=\"https://recordedfuture.com/blog/exploiting-old-vulnerabilities\">vulnerabilities are being actively exploited</a> to intercepting threat actor chatter about an upcoming attack, open source intelligence enables security professionals to prioritize their time and resources to address the most significant current threats.</p><p>In most cases, this type of work requires an analyst to identify and correlate multiple data points to validate a threat before action is taken. OSINT tools are used to gather and analyze data from public and open sources, including social media networks and the deep web, to identify and correlate multiple data points for threat validation. For example, while a single threatening tweet may not be cause for concern, that same tweet would be viewed in a different light if it were tied to a threat group known to be active in a specific industry.</p><p>One of the most important things to understand about open source intelligence is that it is often used in combination with other intelligence subtypes. Intelligence from closed sources such as internal telemetry, closed <a href=\"https://recordedfuture.com/blog/dark-web-networks\">dark web communities</a>, and external intelligence-sharing communities is regularly used to filter and verify open source intelligence. There are a variety of tools available to help analysts perform these functions, which well look at a bit later on.</p><h2 id=\"the-dark-side-of-open-source-intelligence\">The Dark Side of Open Source Intelligence</h2><p>At this point, its time to address the second major issue with open source intelligence: <strong>if something is readily available to intelligence analysts, its also readily available to threat actors.</strong></p><p><strong>Threat actors use open source intelligence tools and techniques to identify potential targets and exploit weaknesses in target networks.</strong> Once a vulnerability is identified, it is often an <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/how-i-hacked-40-websites-in-7-minutes-5b4c28bc8824\">extremely quick and simple process</a> to exploit it and achieve a variety of malicious objectives. They also seek out sensitive data that can be exploited for malicious purposes, such as launching targeted attacks or selling the information on the dark web.</p><p>This process is the main reason why so many small and medium-sized enterprises get hacked each year. It isnt because threat groups specifically take an interest in them, but rather because vulnerabilities in their network or website architecture are found using simple open source intelligence techniques. In short, they are easy targets.</p><p>And open source intelligence doesnt only enable technical attacks on IT systems and networks. <strong>Different <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/threat-actors/threat-actor-types\">types of threat actors</a> also seek out information about individuals and organizations that can be used to inform sophisticated social engineering campaigns using <a href=\"https://recordedfuture.com/blog/podcast-episode-31\">phishing</a> (email), vishing (phone or voicemail), and SMiShing (SMS).</strong> Often, seemingly innocuous information shared through social networks and blogs can be used to develop highly convincing social engineering campaigns, which in turn are used to trick well-meaning users into compromising their organizations network or assets.</p><p>This is why using open source intelligence for security purposes is so important  It gives you an opportunity to find and fix weaknesses in your organizations network and remove sensitive information <em>before</em> a threat actor uses the same tools and techniques to exploit them.</p><h2 id=\"open-source-intelligence-techniques-and-osint-tools\">Open Source Intelligence Techniques and OSINT Tools</h2><p>Now that weve covered the uses of open source intelligence (both good and bad) its time to look at some of the techniques that can be used to gather and process open source information.</p><br><p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/osint_techniques_c41b559086.webp\" alt=\"OSINT Techniques\"></p><br><p>First, <strong>you must have a clear strategy and <a href=\"https://recordedfuture.com/blog/analytical-threat-intelligence-frameworks\">framework</a> in place for acquiring and using open source intelligence.

Once again, the volume of information available is much too great for manual processes to be even slightly effective.</p><h3 id=\"passive-vs-active-osint\">Passive vs. Active OSINT</h3><p>Broadly speaking, collection of open source intelligence falls into two categories: passive collection and active collection.</p><p><strong>Passive collection</strong> often involves the use of <a href=\"https://recordedfuture.com/blog/threat-intelligence-platform\">threat intelligence platforms (TIPs)</a> to combine a variety of <a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/intelligence-sources-collection/threat-intelligence-feeds\">threat feeds</a> into a single, easily accessible location.

After all, its mostly free, and who can say no to that?\nUnfortunately, much like the other major subtypes  human intelligence, signals intelligence, and geospatial intelligence, to name a few  open source intelligence is widely misunderstood and misused.\nThis widespread use and the growing sophistication of OSINT are reflected in market projections. In fact, according to a report by Future Market Insikt, the OSINT industry is predicted to reach a staggering $58 billion by 2033, highlighting its increasing importance and integration into various sectors.\nIf you have ever asked yourself What does OSINT stand for? What is open source intelligence (OSINT)? Or whats the OSINT meaning? Keep reading to find out.\nIn this blog post, were going to cover the fundamentals of Open Source Intelligence, or OSINT, including how its used, and the tools and techniques that can be employed to gather and analyze it. Well delve into what is OSINT, exploring the OSINT meaning and the significant role it plays in the realm of intelligence gathering.\nKey Takeaways\n\nOpen source intelligence is derived from data and information that is available to the general public. Its not limited to what can be found using Google, although the so-called surface web is an important component.\nAs valuable as open source intelligence can be, information overload is a real concern. Most of the tools and techniques used to conduct open source intelligence initiatives are designed to help security professionals (or threat actors) focus their efforts on specific areas of interest.\nThere is a dark side to open source intelligence: anything that can be found by security professionals can also be found (and used) by threat actors.\nHaving a clear strategy and framework in place for open source intelligence gathering is essential  simply looking for anything that could be interesting or useful will inevitably lead to burnout.\nUsing OSINT tools to discover and protect sensitive data from potential attackers is crucial to reduce the risk of cybersecurity threats.\n\nOSINT Meaning\nBefore we look at common sources and applications of open source intelligence, its important to understand what it actually is.\nAccording to U.S. public law, open source intelligence:\n\nIs produced from publicly available information\nIs collected, analyzed, and disseminated in a timely manner to an appropriate audience\nAddresses a specific intelligence requirement\n\nThe important phrase to focus on here is publicly available.\nThe term open source refers specifically to information that is available for public consumption. If any specialist skills, tools, or techniques are required to access a piece of information, it cant reasonably be considered open source.\n\n\n\nCrucially, open source information is not limited to what you can find using the major search engines. Web pages and other resources that can be found using Google certainly constitute massive sources of open source information, but they are far from the only sources.\nFor starters, a huge proportion of the internet (over 99 percent, according to former Google CEO Eric Schmidt) cannot be found using the major search engines. This so-called deep web is a mass of websites, databases, files, and more that (for a variety of reasons, including the presence of login pages or paywalls) cannot be indexed by Google, Bing, Yahoo, or any other search engine you care to think of. Despite this, much of the content of the deep web can be considered open source because its readily available to the public.\nOSINT tools can be used to access and analyze information from sources beyond traditional search engines. These tools, such as Spiderfoot, searchcode, Searx, Twint, and Metagoofil, gather and analyze massive amounts of data from public and open sources, including social media networks and the deep web, to discover and store large quantities of data, find links and patterns among different pieces of information, and collate discovered information into actionable intelligence.\nIn addition, theres plenty of freely accessible information online that can be found using online tools other than traditional search engines. Well look at this more later on, but as a simple example, tools like SecurityTrails and others can be used to find IP addresses, networks, open ports, webcams, printers, and pretty much anything else thats connected to the internet.\nInformation can also be considered open source if it is:\n\nPublished or broadcast for a public audience (for example, news media content)\nAvailable to the public by request (for example, census data)\nAvailable to the public by subscription or purchase (for example, industry journals)\nCould be seen or heard by any casual observer\nMade available at a meeting open to the public\nObtained by visiting any place or attending any event that is open to the public\n\nAt this point, youre probably thinking, Man, thats a lot of information \nAnd youre right. Were talking about a truly unimaginable quantity of information that is growing at a far higher rate than anybody could ever hope to keep up with. Even if we narrow the field down to a single source of information  lets say Twitter  were forced to cope with hundreds of millions of new data points every day.\nThis, as youve probably gathered, is the inherent trade-off of open source intelligence.\nHistory of OSINT\nThe term OSINT refers to the practice of collecting information from publicly available sources to be used in an intelligence context. This practice has been around for a while, but its the digital era that really propelled OSINT into a league of its own.\nThe foundational roots of OSINT are linked to the formation of the Foreign Broadcast Monitoring Service (FBMS) back in 1941. This organization was charged with the significant role of scrutinizing international broadcast communications to identify any potential dubious activities.\nAccording to the Association of Former Intelligence Officers (AFIO): The US military first coined the term OSINT in the late 1980s. This development stemmed from the recognition that intelligence reform was needed to effectively meet the rapidly changing informational demands, particularly at the tactical battlefield level.\nInitially, OSINT was a tool used primarily by intelligence agencies and law enforcement to gather publicly available information to assist in national security and cybercriminal investigations. The methods involved were time-consuming, often requiring individuals to manually sift through public records, newspapers, and other documents to find relevant information. This manual gathering of information was often difficult due to the vast amount of data one had to sift through. However, as the web evolved, so did the methods of collecting and analyzing publicly available data.\nThe advent of the internet significantly amplified the means through which information could be collected. Suddenly, a wide range of data became publicly available and easily accessible online, from government reports to academic papers, and everything in-between. Websites became a primary data source for OSINT practitioners. These developments led to a boom in the creation of OSINT tools designed to automate the process of data collection and analysis. These tools could quickly gather information from various sources, including publicly accessible databases, social media platforms, and many other tools available in the digital realm.\nAs the field of cybersecurity experienced rapid growth, the application of OSINT expanded. Cybersecurity professionals began to see the value in utilizing OSINT to identify vulnerabilities, assess potential security threats, and bolster organizational security. OSINT tools became essential in monitoring publicly accessible web servers, analyzing metadata, and assessing security vulnerabilities. The data gathered became invaluable in understanding the security posture of an organization, identifying potential threats, and developing strategies to mitigate risks.\nOne notable trend is the integration of machine learning and analytics in OSINT tools to enhance the process of identifying patterns and trends from the collected data. This integration has not only made OSINT tools more effective but has also expanded the range of applications in which they can be utilized. For instance, security researchers now use OSINT to perform penetration tests, while businesses use it to gain insights into their competitors and the market environment.\nMoreover, the community of OSINT researchers has grown over time, with forums, conferences, and groups forming to share knowledge, discuss best practices, and develop new OSINT techniques. Many OSINT tools, including frameworks like Recon-ng, have communities of developers on platforms like GitHub, working to improve, customize, and create modules to extend the capabilities of these tools. The collective effort of these communities has played a significant role in refining the OSINT practice, making it a vital component in intelligence gathering and cybersecurity.\nHow Is Open Source Intelligence Used?\nNow that weve covered the basics of open source intelligence, we can look at how it is commonly used for cybersecurity. The intelligence community plays a crucial role in utilizing OSINT for national security and cybersecurity efforts. \n\n\n\nThere are two common use cases:\n1. Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing\nSecurity professionals use open source intelligence to identify potential weaknesses in friendly networks so that they can be remediated before they are exploited by threat actors. Commonly found weaknesses include:\n\nAccidental leaks of sensitive data, like through social media. Identifying and protecting sensitive data is crucial to reduce the risk of cybersecurity threats.\nOpen ports or unsecured internet-connected devices\nUnpatched software, such as websites running old versions of common CMS products\nLeaked or exposed assets, such as proprietary code on pastebins\n\n2. Identifying External Threats\nAs weve discussed many times in the past, the internet is an excellent source of insights into an organizations most pressing emerging threats. From identifying which new vulnerabilities are being actively exploited to intercepting threat actor chatter about an upcoming attack, open source intelligence enables security professionals to prioritize their time and resources to address the most significant current threats.\nIn most cases, this type of work requires an analyst to identify and correlate multiple data points to validate a threat before action is taken. OSINT tools are used to gather and analyze data from public and open sources, including social media networks and the deep web, to identify and correlate multiple data points for threat validation.

Organizations should prepare for increased DDoS activity, website defacements, and potential wiper malware disguised as ransomware.\nState-Sponsored Espionage and Influence Operations\nWhile state-sponsored cyber disruptions are expected to be restrained due to Frances NATO membership, espionage operations are likely to escalate. State actors might use Olympic-themed lures to gather intelligence, and influence operations from Russia, Iran, and Azerbaijan will likely amplify narratives critical of France, NATO, and Israel.\nThreats to Physical Security\nSupporters of the Islamic State and al-Qaeda in Europe almost certainly intend to target the Olympics with terrorist attacks. A wide array of ideologically driven protest groups will also seek to disrupt the Olympics to advance their agendas. However, extensive security measures are expected to mitigate the probability and impact of successful attacks or violent protests. Event organizers should monitor online forums and messaging applications for potential attack vectors and targets.\n\nDespite the likelihood of cyber disruptions from hacktivists and criminal groups, geopolitical developments could shift the threat landscape. Escalations in Russias war against Ukraine or significant increases in French aid to Ukraine could trigger actions from Russian state-sponsored groups. Similarly, developments in the Middle East could increase the risk of attacks from hacktivists, terrorists, or state proxy groups. It is crucial to monitor tensions in Europe and the Middle East to anticipate increased risks.\nTo read the entire analysis, click here to download the report as a PDF.","enclosure":{"url":"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/Main_Feature_3_d5dff80636.webp","length":"0","type":"image/webp"},"content":"Discover the 2024 Paris Olympic Games' threats, including cyberattacks, espionage, and physical security risks, with insights from Insikt Group's latest research.","contentSnippet":"Discover the 2024 Paris Olympic Games' threats, including cyberattacks, espionage, and physical security risks, with insights from Insikt Group's latest research.","guid":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/hurdling-over-hazards-multifaceted-threats-to-the-2024-paris-olympics","categories":["Research (Insikt)"],"isoDate":"2024-06-04T00:00:00.000Z","tag":"intel"},{"title":"GRU's BlueDelta Targets Key Networks in Europe with Multi-Phase Espionage Campaigns","link":"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/grus-bluedelta-targets-key-networks-in-europe-with-multi-phase-espionage-camp","pubDate":"Thu, 30 May 2024 00:00:00 GMT","content:encoded":"<p><img src=\"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png\" alt=\"insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png\"></p><p>Insikt Group tracks the evolutions of GRU&#39;s BlueDelta operational infrastructure, targeting networks across Europe with information-stealing Headlace malware and credential-harvesting web pages.

Then I decided that I wanted a more secure  pun intended  career path that didnt hinge on my creative output. I sub-majored in network security in university and took a chance on a cybersecurity graduate position, which I really ended up liking. Ive kind of been doing both ever since. </p><h3 id=\"whats-your-role-at-canva\">Whats your role at Canva?</h3><p>(Zito) I lead the Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) team. Since starting in this industry, I have tried a little bit of everything  incident response, security engineering, vulnerability management. Eventually, I settled on specializing in CTI and have been doing that ever since.</p><p>When I joined Canva, the role was actually to help build out the detection and response capability. While interviewing, I had some candid discussions with the head of security at the time, and we both agreed it didnt make sense for there to be any dedicated CTI capability without a mature detection and response team first. Theres honestly no point in threat intelligence if theres no way to action it, and to do that you need a solid incident response team as your foundation. Imagine flipping over all these rocks and theres no-one around to deal with the spiders!</p><p>After a year or two, we felt we were ready to build out a CTI program, which weve done from scratch.  While weve made a huge amount of progress, were still a very lean team and Im still on a bit of everything train: I engineer our collections, automation and intelligence sharing infrastructure; maintain intelligence requirements and alerting use cases; still tag-team on incidents where intelligence analysis can benefit; and design ways for strategic threat intelligence to make its way to the right areas of the business.</p><h3 id=\"to-bianca-forbes-how-did-you-get-started-in-cybersecurity-and-what-is-your-role-at-canva\">(To Bianca Forbes) How did you get started in cybersecurity? And what is your role at Canva?</h3><p>(Bianca Forbes) I actually started out in penetration testing, which I did for three years, before moving into cyber threat intelligence. When I first got into CTI, I didnt know much about it. After getting thrown in the deep end, I came to really enjoy researching and tracking adversaries as well as the contacts in the intelligence community that I made. Ive been doing it ever since.</p><p>At Canva, I help run the CTI program with Jasmina. I focus primarily on intelligence operations: tracking adversaries, reporting on trends in the threat landscape, providing analysis expertise in investigations, and crafting threat hunting packages.</p><h3 id=\"how-did-you-get-buy-in-for-building-a-cyber-threat-intelligence-cti-program-why-should-other-companies-consider-investing-in-threat-intelligence\">How did you get buy-in for building a Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) program? Why should other companies consider investing in threat intelligence?</h3><p>(Zito) To use an industry buzzword  CTI really helps security teams shift left. Traditionally, without CTI, you may be detecting and responding to threats using only the information you have from within your own network. Youre looking for something bad but youre not always sure what, how, or when. </p><p><strong>In my mind, once you detect a threat, you&#39;ve already got it in your environment. Its too late. It&#39;s already happened.</strong></p><p>I think what really helped me get buy-in was to actually start producing CTI products to showcase their value. At the heart of it, the value of threat intelligence is influencing: you use your deliverables to convince the business to do something, whether its investing in a capability, changing the way something is done, or paying more attention to an identified risk. </p><p>You obviously have to start small and be very curated when you dont have dedicated resources. Ive seen it go wrong when emerging teams simply rehash the news or flick on all the threat feeds, which causes a lot of frustration for the people who have to do extra work as a result of the onslaught of new, incoming information. You have to start somewhere but you also have to know what you want out of it all. This is where threat modeling can help. Understanding your organizations crown jewels and what the risks are (your intelligence requirements) helps you be more strategic about where to start.</p><p>In my talk at Recorded Future Predict23 in Singapore, I mentioned a few tips based on lessons learned over time.</p><p><strong>Tip #1:</strong> Instead of sending out daily security news summaries to a mailing list, try referencing a security report in an action item sent directly to the team who can remediate a specific security risk. </p><p>Being that filter between all the sensationalized articles and what your organization actually needs to action helped us build rapport and trust between teams. If you meet your peers halfway, actually read the report and try to make a call on what needs to be done and by whom, youve reduced a lot of mental labor for everyone involved. An added bonus is that you subconsciously train folks to pay attention to when you send them something, otherwise I wager pretty strongly that those daily digests are going to end up in the junk pile a lot of the time.</p><p><strong>Tip #2:</strong> Instead of turning on threat intelligence modules and data feeds in all of your security tools, try only ingesting high-fidelity observables that directly map to a threat youre concerned about. </p><p>That doesnt mean you need to intentionally miss out on a bunch of data during collections. Something Bianca and I have built out is kind of like a tier-based system. All of the observables from our commercial and open source come into the threat intelligence platform (TIP), and they actually all go to the SIEM as well, but that doesnt mean they all are treated the same way. The bulk, raw data is used for enrichment and historical referencing. Then, as part of our usual operational cadence, we will research and validate a subset of observables that meet our intelligence requirements. </p><p>Based on our research, well add extra context and metadata to those observables and intentionally mark them as curated so that they become active in our security tools and can be used in detection or prevention rules. This way, we combat the perception that CTI is just a stream of low-fidelity observables that cause a lot of noise and alert fatigue. </p><p>Once we had that foundation of trust and confidence in the value and fidelity of the curated data, we could then weigh in on the detection engineering process by providing expertise on what metadata can be used  out of the remaining uncurated observable data  to satisfy specific detection use cases.</p><h3 id=\"as-youre-putting-together-your-cyber-threat-intelligence-function-what-kind-of-information-is-needed\">As you&#39;re putting together your Cyber Threat Intelligence function, what kind of information is needed?</h3><p>(Zito) Once you&#39;ve got your intelligence requirements  pick three to start off with and then work back from there you could ask yourself:</p><ul><li>What information do I need to answer those questions? </li><li>Is it open source information? Is it commercial intelligence? A mixture of both?</li><li>What data do I need?  How will I then consume that data? </li><li>Do I have a threat intelligence platform?</li></ul><p>You need to figure out where you&#39;re going to put all of that information, and understand whether you have the technical capability to actually manage all of that infrastructure yourself. If you&#39;re a small team and you don&#39;t have a lot of engineering resources, maybe you&#39;ll actually start off with something commercial and buy instead of build so you dont have to think about managing infrastructure and can instead focus on actual analysis.</p><p>It can be tempting to get started using open source tooling. I love that theres passionate people out there collectively building free tools to help with CTI operations. I would be cautious here about the time and skills needed to maintain some of these systems, as they can require a bit of TLC and jerry-rigging. Again, starting small and being intentional about your desired outcome is your best shot at incremental success.</p><p>When it comes to people, there are a lot of varying skills among CTI practitioners. For example, because of Bianca&#39;s pentesting background, shes very technically proficient and good at researching how adversary TTPs evolve; and there are other folks who specialize in what I would call more traditional intelligence analysis. It really just depends on your organization and what&#39;s going to work best to satisfy your intelligence requirements.  </p><p>If, like Canva, your organization is tech and software-centric, maybe its important you have people with the technical ability to understand how the latest obscure exploit could actually impact you, if at all. Whereas, if you are in critical infrastructure, maybe you need a bit more of that geopolitical background to help you understand which APT groups are a threat to your organization by understanding why somebody would try to come after critical infrastructure in the first place. </p><h3 id=\"how-do-you-think-about-connecting-your-people-tools-and-workflows\">How do you think about connecting your people, tools and workflows?</h3><p>(Zito) If you think about the teams consuming your intelligence products as customers, you need to understand their ways of working, their pain points, and what they need from you to support them. I usually pick one customer at a time, and pilot a workflow end-to-end based after sitting down with them and understanding <strong><em>their</em></strong> requirements.</p><p>If youre into games, pretend this is a role-playing game (RPG) and youre the support class. Your job is throwing heals and buffs. Youre likely not on the front lines in the heat of the battle, so its not really fair if you insist on calling all the shots.</p><p>If you use your blue team / SOC as an example first customer, they very likely have their own tooling for detections, their own case management system to house investigations and incidents, and their own internal comms channels. Nobody wants to receive an email with an attached report that has a bunch of random observables listed at the end in no particular format, that they then have to manually put into a system. What a waste of time!</p><p>When you talk to your blue team, you may learn that if they could have anything they wanted, it would be for someone to do all that for them and to not have to think about it. Theres no real reason they need to read a report for the threat to be blocked. If they need context, theyll be able to find it <strong>if</strong> an alert ever triggers. </p><p>Unfortunately, we (CTI) really dont want to be copy-paste robots either. So we automate. In cases where the analysis has already been done and all we need to do is block some hashes or C2 IPs, why does anyone have to be involved in the process? CTI should be able to click a button to validate an observable, and based on metadata, it goes where it needs to go. Thats essentially what we ended up building. </p><p>And that actually means now that when an intelligence report is published, its much more likely to be read, because the last one wasnt just a day ago. <strong>We want people to feel confident that silence from us equals no threat to worry about.</strong></p><p>(Forbes) A good example of an integrated workflow with Recorded Future is how we develop threat hunting packages. Our team is continually tracking trends in the threat landscape and we have processes to help us identify what is relevant to us. Reflecting back on the idea behind the tier-based system we have for observables, we consume all of the threat hunting packages Recorded Future publishes. Once we identify a threat trend we want to hunt for, we can use the relevant ingested packages as a building block for the final deliverable. Its especially helpful considering they come with YARA rules and TTPs, so it reduces some of the manual work we have to do. </p><p>Once a hunting package is developed, weve built an automated message that sends all the relevant information to the threat hunting team, again, integrating with their workflow and tooling. Another benefit of working closely with our customers when designing integrations is we can get valuable feedback about the outcomes of our intelligence products.</p><p>Another example workflow is how we mitigate risks associated with our supply chain vendors. By populating our suppliers watch list within Recorded Future, we can then look for things like who&#39;s attacking our suppliers. An example would be if one of our critical vendors has been posted on a ransomware blog site. Oftentimes we&#39;ll learn about that through Recorded Future before the vendor even reaches out and says, Hey, we&#39;ve had an incident. Yeah, we know we&#39;ve been watching. Recorded Future allows us to get on the front foot in those types of situations.</p><h3 id=\"how-do-you-showcase-the-value-that-youre-bringing-to-the-rest-of-the-security-organization-and-to-the-rest-of-the-company\">How do you showcase the value that youre bringing to the rest of the security organization? And to the rest of the company?</h3><p>(Zito) We track the fidelity of our deliverables by showing how much information and data we consume and how much of that turned into some kind of action. </p><p>For example, if we pulled in 100 threat reports; shortlisted 20 based on the topic meeting our intelligence requirements; and only 3 turned into an internal threat bulletin with recommended actions - thats actually a good thing.

Then I decided that I wanted a more secure  pun intended  career path that didnt hinge on my creative output. I sub-majored in network security in university and took a chance on a cybersecurity graduate position, which I really ended up liking. Ive kind of been doing both ever since. \nWhats your role at Canva?\n(Zito) I lead the Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) team. Since starting in this industry, I have tried a little bit of everything  incident response, security engineering, vulnerability management. Eventually, I settled on specializing in CTI and have been doing that ever since.\nWhen I joined Canva, the role was actually to help build out the detection and response capability. While interviewing, I had some candid discussions with the head of security at the time, and we both agreed it didnt make sense for there to be any dedicated CTI capability without a mature detection and response team first. Theres honestly no point in threat intelligence if theres no way to action it, and to do that you need a solid incident response team as your foundation. Imagine flipping over all these rocks and theres no-one around to deal with the spiders!\nAfter a year or two, we felt we were ready to build out a CTI program, which weve done from scratch.  While weve made a huge amount of progress, were still a very lean team and Im still on a bit of everything train: I engineer our collections, automation and intelligence sharing infrastructure; maintain intelligence requirements and alerting use cases; still tag-team on incidents where intelligence analysis can benefit; and design ways for strategic threat intelligence to make its way to the right areas of the business.\n(To Bianca Forbes) How did you get started in cybersecurity? And what is your role at Canva?\n(Bianca Forbes) I actually started out in penetration testing, which I did for three years, before moving into cyber threat intelligence. When I first got into CTI, I didnt know much about it. After getting thrown in the deep end, I came to really enjoy researching and tracking adversaries as well as the contacts in the intelligence community that I made. Ive been doing it ever since.\nAt Canva, I help run the CTI program with Jasmina. I focus primarily on intelligence operations: tracking adversaries, reporting on trends in the threat landscape, providing analysis expertise in investigations, and crafting threat hunting packages.\nHow did you get buy-in for building a Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) program? Why should other companies consider investing in threat intelligence?\n(Zito) To use an industry buzzword  CTI really helps security teams shift left. Traditionally, without CTI, you may be detecting and responding to threats using only the information you have from within your own network. Youre looking for something bad but youre not always sure what, how, or when. \nIn my mind, once you detect a threat, you've already got it in your environment. Its too late. It's already happened.\nI think what really helped me get buy-in was to actually start producing CTI products to showcase their value. At the heart of it, the value of threat intelligence is influencing: you use your deliverables to convince the business to do something, whether its investing in a capability, changing the way something is done, or paying more attention to an identified risk. \nYou obviously have to start small and be very curated when you dont have dedicated resources. Ive seen it go wrong when emerging teams simply rehash the news or flick on all the threat feeds, which causes a lot of frustration for the people who have to do extra work as a result of the onslaught of new, incoming information. You have to start somewhere but you also have to know what you want out of it all. This is where threat modeling can help. Understanding your organizations crown jewels and what the risks are (your intelligence requirements) helps you be more strategic about where to start.\nIn my talk at Recorded Future Predict23 in Singapore, I mentioned a few tips based on lessons learned over time.\nTip #1: Instead of sending out daily security news summaries to a mailing list, try referencing a security report in an action item sent directly to the team who can remediate a specific security risk. \nBeing that filter between all the sensationalized articles and what your organization actually needs to action helped us build rapport and trust between teams. If you meet your peers halfway, actually read the report and try to make a call on what needs to be done and by whom, youve reduced a lot of mental labor for everyone involved. An added bonus is that you subconsciously train folks to pay attention to when you send them something, otherwise I wager pretty strongly that those daily digests are going to end up in the junk pile a lot of the time.\nTip #2: Instead of turning on threat intelligence modules and data feeds in all of your security tools, try only ingesting high-fidelity observables that directly map to a threat youre concerned about. \nThat doesnt mean you need to intentionally miss out on a bunch of data during collections. Something Bianca and I have built out is kind of like a tier-based system. All of the observables from our commercial and open source come into the threat intelligence platform (TIP), and they actually all go to the SIEM as well, but that doesnt mean they all are treated the same way. The bulk, raw data is used for enrichment and historical referencing. Then, as part of our usual operational cadence, we will research and validate a subset of observables that meet our intelligence requirements. \nBased on our research, well add extra context and metadata to those observables and intentionally mark them as curated so that they become active in our security tools and can be used in detection or prevention rules. This way, we combat the perception that CTI is just a stream of low-fidelity observables that cause a lot of noise and alert fatigue. \nOnce we had that foundation of trust and confidence in the value and fidelity of the curated data, we could then weigh in on the detection engineering process by providing expertise on what metadata can be used  out of the remaining uncurated observable data  to satisfy specific detection use cases.\nAs you're putting together your Cyber Threat Intelligence function, what kind of information is needed?\n(Zito) Once you've got your intelligence requirements  pick three to start off with and then work back from there you could ask yourself:\n\nWhat information do I need to answer those questions? \nIs it open source information? Is it commercial intelligence? A mixture of both?\nWhat data do I need?  How will I then consume that data? \nDo I have a threat intelligence platform?\n\nYou need to figure out where you're going to put all of that information, and understand whether you have the technical capability to actually manage all of that infrastructure yourself. If you're a small team and you don't have a lot of engineering resources, maybe you'll actually start off with something commercial and buy instead of build so you dont have to think about managing infrastructure and can instead focus on actual analysis.\nIt can be tempting to get started using open source tooling. I love that theres passionate people out there collectively building free tools to help with CTI operations. I would be cautious here about the time and skills needed to maintain some of these systems, as they can require a bit of TLC and jerry-rigging. Again, starting small and being intentional about your desired outcome is your best shot at incremental success.\nWhen it comes to people, there are a lot of varying skills among CTI practitioners. For example, because of Bianca's pentesting background, shes very technically proficient and good at researching how adversary TTPs evolve; and there are other folks who specialize in what I would call more traditional intelligence analysis. It really just depends on your organization and what's going to work best to satisfy your intelligence requirements.  \nIf, like Canva, your organization is tech and software-centric, maybe its important you have people with the technical ability to understand how the latest obscure exploit could actually impact you, if at all. Whereas, if you are in critical infrastructure, maybe you need a bit more of that geopolitical background to help you understand which APT groups are a threat to your organization by understanding why somebody would try to come after critical infrastructure in the first place. \nHow do you think about connecting your people, tools and workflows?\n(Zito) If you think about the teams consuming your intelligence products as customers, you need to understand their ways of working, their pain points, and what they need from you to support them. I usually pick one customer at a time, and pilot a workflow end-to-end based after sitting down with them and understanding their requirements.\nIf youre into games, pretend this is a role-playing game (RPG) and youre the support class. Your job is throwing heals and buffs. Youre likely not on the front lines in the heat of the battle, so its not really fair if you insist on calling all the shots.\nIf you use your blue team / SOC as an example first customer, they very likely have their own tooling for detections, their own case management system to house investigations and incidents, and their own internal comms channels. Nobody wants to receive an email with an attached report that has a bunch of random observables listed at the end in no particular format, that they then have to manually put into a system. What a waste of time!\nWhen you talk to your blue team, you may learn that if they could have anything they wanted, it would be for someone to do all that for them and to not have to think about it. Theres no real reason they need to read a report for the threat to be blocked. If they need context, theyll be able to find it if an alert ever triggers. \nUnfortunately, we (CTI) really dont want to be copy-paste robots either. So we automate. In cases where the analysis has already been done and all we need to do is block some hashes or C2 IPs, why does anyone have to be involved in the process? CTI should be able to click a button to validate an observable, and based on metadata, it goes where it needs to go. Thats essentially what we ended up building. \nAnd that actually means now that when an intelligence report is published, its much more likely to be read, because the last one wasnt just a day ago. We want people to feel confident that silence from us equals no threat to worry about.\n(Forbes) A good example of an integrated workflow with Recorded Future is how we develop threat hunting packages. Our team is continually tracking trends in the threat landscape and we have processes to help us identify what is relevant to us. Reflecting back on the idea behind the tier-based system we have for observables, we consume all of the threat hunting packages Recorded Future publishes. Once we identify a threat trend we want to hunt for, we can use the relevant ingested packages as a building block for the final deliverable. Its especially helpful considering they come with YARA rules and TTPs, so it reduces some of the manual work we have to do. \nOnce a hunting package is developed, weve built an automated message that sends all the relevant information to the threat hunting team, again, integrating with their workflow and tooling. Another benefit of working closely with our customers when designing integrations is we can get valuable feedback about the outcomes of our intelligence products.\nAnother example workflow is how we mitigate risks associated with our supply chain vendors. By populating our suppliers watch list within Recorded Future, we can then look for things like who's attacking our suppliers. An example would be if one of our critical vendors has been posted on a ransomware blog site. Oftentimes we'll learn about that through Recorded Future before the vendor even reaches out and says, Hey, we've had an incident. Yeah, we know we've been watching. Recorded Future allows us to get on the front foot in those types of situations.\nHow do you showcase the value that youre bringing to the rest of the security organization? And to the rest of the company?\n(Zito) We track the fidelity of our deliverables by showing how much information and data we consume and how much of that turned into some kind of action. \nFor example, if we pulled in 100 threat reports; shortlisted 20 based on the topic meeting our intelligence requirements; and only 3 turned into an internal threat bulletin with recommended actions - thats actually a good thing. It shows that we filtered and curated information really well before it got on anyones to-do list.\nIt doesnt stop at recommendations or information shared, though. We also want to know how much of the work we have generated for other teams resulted in something useful. If we published a threat hunting package and no malicious activity was uncovered, thats great. But what else did we discover? Were there any new detection ideas as a result? Is there any additional telemetry that we could monitor? \nWhen we're talking about showing value to the broader organization, it's really about taking the macro trends from all of those metrics and surfacing it into high level insights. Imagine if you started out thinking malware was your biggest threat because thats what your industrys threat landscape is telling you. \nOnce you start collecting data about the outcomes of your intelligence products  What category of observables triggered the most alerts? How many threat bulletins resulted in a security investigation and subsequent uplift, and in what areas? \nYou may learn your biggest threat is something entirely different. Or, if you dont, at least the data validates your current assessment. Either way, this can help you drive your overall security strategy by supporting continued investment into existing focus areas or highlighting areas that may need more attention.","enclosure":{"url":"https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/2024_0514_Canva_Blog_Main_Feature_7ba1ffcaab.webp","length":"0","type":"image/webp"},"content":"Learn how Canva's CTI team, led by Jasmina Zito and Bianca Forbes, built an empowered threat intelligence team.
