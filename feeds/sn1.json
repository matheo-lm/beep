Email has been the perennial choice for spam delivery, but the prevalence of new communications platforms has expanded the spam attack surface considerably.</p>\n<p>This report explores AkiraBot, a Python framework that targets small to medium sized business website contact forms and chat widgets. AkiraBot is designed to post AI-generated spam messages tailored to the targeted website’s content that shill the services for a dubious Search Engine Optimization (SEO) network. The use of LLM-generated content likely helps these messages bypass spam filters, as the spam content is different each time a message is generated. The framework also rotates which attacker-controlled domain is supplied in the messages, further complicating spam filtering efforts.</p>\n<p>The bot creator has invested significant effort into evading CAPTCHA filters as well as avoiding network detections by relying on a proxy service generally marketed towards advertisers–though the service has had considerable interest and use by cybercriminal actors.</p>\n<p>AkiraBot is not related to the ransomware group Akira; this name was chosen due to the bot’s consistent use of domains that use “Akira” as the SEO service brand.</p>\n<h2>Script Execution and Website Feature Targeting</h2>\n<p>SentinelLABS identified several archives containing scripts related to this framework with file timestamps dating back to September 2024. The oldest archive refers to the bot as Shopbot, likely a reference to its targeting of websites using Shopify. As the tool evolved, the targeting expanded to include websites built using GoDaddy and Wix, as well as generic website contact forms, which includes websites built using Squarespace, and likely other technologies. These technologies are primarily used by small- to medium-sized businesses for their ease in enabling website development with integrations for eCommerce, website content management, and business service offerings.</p>\n<p>There are many versions of this tool with file timestamps in the archives indicating activity between September 2024 to present. Each version uses one of two hardcoded OpenAI API keys and the same proxy credentials and test sites, which links the archives despite the disparate naming conventions. We identified AkiraBot-related archives that had the following root directory names:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">bubble_working_clone</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">fingerprints-server</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">GoDaddy</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">NextCaptcha and FastCaptcha</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">NextCaptchaBot-v6</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">override</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">petar_bot</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">shopbotpyv2</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">SHOPIFY_SYSTEM_UPDATED</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">updatedpybot</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">wix</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">wixbot</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">WORKING_FOLDER</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, logs from the tool reveal that the operator ran it from the following paths, suggesting that they are most likely using Windows Server systems based on the Administrator username being the most prevalent:</p>\n<pre>\r\n \tC:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/\r\n \tC:/Users/Administrator/Downloads/\r\n \tC:/Users/Usuario/Desktop/ - only appears in the archive named GoDaddy\r\n</pre>\n<p>Originally, AkiraBot spammed website contact forms enticing the site owner to purchase SEO services. Newer versions of AkiraBot have also targeted the Live Chat widgets integrated into many websites, including Reamaze widgets.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_117818\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-117818\" style=\"width: 929px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_6.jpg\" alt=\"_submit_old_website function in v14.py\" width=\"929\" height=\"363\" class=\"size-full wp-image-117818\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_6.jpg 929w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_6-300x117.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_6-768x300.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 929px) 100vw, 929px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-117818\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>_submit_old_website</em> function in <em>v14.py</em></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The bot has a GUI that shows success metrics and lets the operator choose a target list to run against.

The targeted CAPTCHA services include hCAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA, including Cloudflare’s hCAPTCHA service in certain versions of the tool.</p>\n<p>We identified an archive with files for CAPTCHA-related servers and browser fingerprints, which allow the bot’s web traffic to mimic a legitimate end user. The archives contain a fingerprint server that runs on the same system as the other AkiraBot tools and intercepts the website loading processes using Selenium <a href=\"https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WebDriver</a>, an automation framework that simulates user browsing activity.</p>\n<p>The <code>inject.js</code> script injects code into the targeted website’s Document Object Model (DOM) which enables the tool to modify how the website loads in real time and change behaviors. <code>inject.js</code> manipulates values in the session via a headless Chrome instance that makes the session appear like an end user’s browser to the webserver. The script modifies multiple browser attributes that webservers use to identify the nature of the browser viewing the website, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Audio Context and Voice engines, which are used to profile whether a session is headless or a real browser</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Graphics rendering, including canvas and WebGL attributes</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Installed fonts</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Navigator</a> objects, which provide a wealth of profiling information, such as browser type, operating system &amp; architecture, geolocation, hardware details, languages installed, and browser privacy settings</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">System memory, storage, and CPU profile</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Timezone</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The bot uses several CAPTCHA bypassing services, including Capsolver, FastCaptcha, and NextCaptcha, which are failover services for when browser emulation is insufficient to interact with the targeted website.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_117819\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-117819\" style=\"width: 1254px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_4.jpg\" alt=\"FastCaptcha token generator function in v10.py\" width=\"1254\" height=\"630\" class=\"size-full wp-image-117819\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_4.jpg 1254w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_4-300x151.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_4-1024x514.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_4-768x386.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1254px) 100vw, 1254px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-117819\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">FastCaptcha token generator function in <em>v10.py</em></figcaption></figure>\n<p>AkiraBot also runs a headless Chrome instance to refresh values for <a href=\"https://support.reamaze.com/kb/automation/enable-ai-spam-filtering-for-chat-and-email-channels\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Reamaze</a> tokens periodically.

In each archive SentinelLABS analyzed, AkiraBot used the SmartProxy service. SmartProxy’s website claims that its proxies are ethically sourced and that they provide data center, mobile, and residential proxies. Each version of the bot uses the same proxy credentials, suggesting the same actor is behind each iteration.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_117826\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-117826\" style=\"width: 649px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_19.jpg\" alt=\"get_random_proxy function in The_NextCaptcha_Bot.py\" width=\"649\" height=\"288\" class=\"size-full wp-image-117826\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_19.jpg 649w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_19-300x133.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 649px) 100vw, 649px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-117826\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>get_random_proxy</em> function in <em>The_NextCaptcha_Bot.py</em></figcaption></figure>\n<p>While SmartProxy is a service that seems to operate within legal boundaries, it is worth noting that it has regularly had the attention of cybercriminals.

The <code>submissions.csv</code> file from the January 2025 archives show more than 80,000 unique domains that were successfully spammed. The script also logs failed attempts in <code>failed.txt</code> and <code>failed_old.txt</code>. The January 2025 archives showed that only 11,000 domains had failed, including previous runs of the tool. We analyzed all <code>submissions.csv</code> files; deduplicating the results revealed that more than 420,000 unique domains were targeted in total.</p>\n<p>Two versions of AkiraBot used a Telegram bot for logging success metrics. The scripts <code>monitor.py</code> and <code>monitor_random.py</code> would collect success metrics from the bot and post them to a Telegram channel via API.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_117823\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-117823\" style=\"width: 853px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_21.jpg\" alt=\"Telegram sending functionality in monitor.py\" width=\"853\" height=\"403\" class=\"size-full wp-image-117823\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_21.jpg 853w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_21-300x142.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_21-768x363.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 853px) 100vw, 853px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-117823\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Telegram sending functionality in <em>monitor.py</em></figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Telegram Detail</h2>\n<p>The Telegram functionality, contained in the <code>monitor.py</code> and <code>monitor_random.py</code> scripts, is tied into proxy rotation and CAPTCHA defeat features contained within the bundled JavaScript file <code>script.js</code>.  The <code>monitor.py</code> script utilizes <code>pyautogui</code> to paste the contents of <code>script.js</code> into a browser developer console by scripting CTRL+SHIFT+J, followed by the paste command, eventually executing the JavaScript within the browser console.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_117837\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-117837\" style=\"width: 337px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_1.jpg\" alt=\"pyautogui actions in monitor.py\" width=\"337\" height=\"369\" class=\"size-full wp-image-117837\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_1.jpg 337w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_1-274x300.jpg 274w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 337px) 100vw, 337px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-117837\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>pyautogui</em> actions in <em>monitor.py</em></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The pasted and executed JavaScript is then responsible for attempting CAPTCHA refreshes and defeats on targeted URLs, reporting the status returned to a JSON file, <code>stats.json</code>.

We expect this campaign to continue to evolve as website hosting providers adapt defenses to deter spam. The author or authors have invested significant effort in this bot’s ability to bypass commonly used CAPTCHA technologies, which demonstrates that the operators are motivated to violate service provider protections.</p>\n<p>AkiraBot’s use of LLM-generated spam message content demonstrates the emerging challenges that AI poses to defending websites against spam attacks. The easiest indicators to block are the rotating set of domains used to sell the Akira and ServiceWrap SEO offerings, as there is no longer a consistent approach in the spam message contents as there were with previous campaigns selling the services of these firms.</p>\n<p>SentinelLABS thanks the OpenAI security team for their collaboration and continued efforts in deterring bad actors from abusing their services. The OpenAI team shared the following response following their investigation:</p>\n<p><em>“We&#8217;re grateful to SentinelOne for sharing their research. Distributing output from our services for spam is against our policies. The API key involved is disabled, and we’re continuing to investigate and will disable any associated assets.

Email has been the perennial choice for spam delivery, but the prevalence of new communications platforms has expanded the spam attack surface considerably.\nThis report explores AkiraBot, a Python framework that targets small to medium sized business website contact forms and chat widgets. AkiraBot is designed to post AI-generated spam messages tailored to the targeted website’s content that shill the services for a dubious Search Engine Optimization (SEO) network. The use of LLM-generated content likely helps these messages bypass spam filters, as the spam content is different each time a message is generated. The framework also rotates which attacker-controlled domain is supplied in the messages, further complicating spam filtering efforts.\nThe bot creator has invested significant effort into evading CAPTCHA filters as well as avoiding network detections by relying on a proxy service generally marketed towards advertisers–though the service has had considerable interest and use by cybercriminal actors.\nAkiraBot is not related to the ransomware group Akira; this name was chosen due to the bot’s consistent use of domains that use “Akira” as the SEO service brand.\nScript Execution and Website Feature Targeting\nSentinelLABS identified several archives containing scripts related to this framework with file timestamps dating back to September 2024. The oldest archive refers to the bot as Shopbot, likely a reference to its targeting of websites using Shopify. As the tool evolved, the targeting expanded to include websites built using GoDaddy and Wix, as well as generic website contact forms, which includes websites built using Squarespace, and likely other technologies. These technologies are primarily used by small- to medium-sized businesses for their ease in enabling website development with integrations for eCommerce, website content management, and business service offerings.\nThere are many versions of this tool with file timestamps in the archives indicating activity between September 2024 to present. Each version uses one of two hardcoded OpenAI API keys and the same proxy credentials and test sites, which links the archives despite the disparate naming conventions. We identified AkiraBot-related archives that had the following root directory names:\nbubble_working_clone\nfingerprints-server\nGoDaddy\nNextCaptcha and FastCaptcha\nNextCaptchaBot-v6\noverride\npetar_bot\nshopbotpyv2\nSHOPIFY_SYSTEM_UPDATED\nupdatedpybot\nwix\nwixbot\nWORKING_FOLDER\nAdditionally, logs from the tool reveal that the operator ran it from the following paths, suggesting that they are most likely using Windows Server systems based on the Administrator username being the most prevalent:\n\r\n \tC:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/\r\n \tC:/Users/Administrator/Downloads/\r\n \tC:/Users/Usuario/Desktop/ - only appears in the archive named GoDaddy\r\n\nOriginally, AkiraBot spammed website contact forms enticing the site owner to purchase SEO services. Newer versions of AkiraBot have also targeted the Live Chat widgets integrated into many websites, including Reamaze widgets.\n_submit_old_website function in v14.py\nThe bot has a GUI that shows success metrics and lets the operator choose a target list to run against. The GUI lets the operator customize how many threads are running at once, a feature the bot uses to target many sites concurrently.\nAkiraBot GUI\nSpam Message Generation\nSearching for websites referencing AkiraBot domains shows that the bot previously spammed websites in a way that the message was indexed by search engines.\nGoogle search results containing useakira[.]com\nSpam comment on website from 2023 and content from AkiraBot templates.txt file\nAkiraBot creates custom spam messages for targeted websites by processing a template that contains a generic outline of the type of message the bot should send.\nSpam message template\nThe template is processed by a prompt sent to the OpenAI chat API to generate a customized outreach message based on the contents of the website. The OpenAI client uses model gpt-4o-mini and is assigned the role “You are a helpful assistant that generates marketing messages.” and the prompt instructs the LLM to replace the variables <WEBSITE_NAME> and <KEYWORD> with the site name provided at runtime.\nAI Chat prompt from v10.py\nThe <KEYWORD> is generated by processing the {context} variable, which contains text scraped from the targeted website via BeautifulSoup, a library that transforms raw HTML code into human–or LLM–readable text.\nAkiraBot’s generate_message function\nThe resulting message includes a brief description of the targeted website, making the message seem curated. The benefit of generating each message using an LLM is that the message content is unique and filtering against spam becomes more difficult compared to using a consistent message template which can trivially be filtered.\nLogged AI-generated outreach messages in submissions.csv\nCAPTCHA Bypass & Network Evasion Techniques\nCAPTCHA Bypass\nAkiraBot puts significant emphasis on evading CAPTCHAs so that it can spam websites at scale. The targeted CAPTCHA services include hCAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA, including Cloudflare’s hCAPTCHA service in certain versions of the tool.\nWe identified an archive with files for CAPTCHA-related servers and browser fingerprints, which allow the bot’s web traffic to mimic a legitimate end user. The archives contain a fingerprint server that runs on the same system as the other AkiraBot tools and intercepts the website loading processes using Selenium WebDriver, an automation framework that simulates user browsing activity.\nThe inject.js script injects code into the targeted website’s Document Object Model (DOM) which enables the tool to modify how the website loads in real time and change behaviors. inject.js manipulates values in the session via a headless Chrome instance that makes the session appear like an end user’s browser to the webserver. The script modifies multiple browser attributes that webservers use to identify the nature of the browser viewing the website, including:\nAudio Context and Voice engines, which are used to profile whether a session is headless or a real browser\nGraphics rendering, including canvas and WebGL attributes\nInstalled fonts\nNavigator objects, which provide a wealth of profiling information, such as browser type, operating system & architecture, geolocation, hardware details, languages installed, and browser privacy settings\nSystem memory, storage, and CPU profile\nTimezone\nThe bot uses several CAPTCHA bypassing services, including Capsolver, FastCaptcha, and NextCaptcha, which are failover services for when browser emulation is insufficient to interact with the targeted website.\nFastCaptcha token generator function in v10.py\nAkiraBot also runs a headless Chrome instance to refresh values for Reamaze tokens periodically. Reamaze provides websites with customer support chat integrations, making this another targeted feature. The service also offers spam filters for chats on its platform, indicating that this is a known vector for spam attacks.\nReamaze token handling function\nNetwork Evasion Techniques\nAkiraBot uses many different proxy hosts to evade network detections and diversify the source of where its traffic comes from. In each archive SentinelLABS analyzed, AkiraBot used the SmartProxy service. SmartProxy’s website claims that its proxies are ethically sourced and that they provide data center, mobile, and residential proxies. Each version of the bot uses the same proxy credentials, suggesting the same actor is behind each iteration.\nget_random_proxy function in The_NextCaptcha_Bot.py\nWhile SmartProxy is a service that seems to operate within legal boundaries, it is worth noting that it has regularly had the attention of cybercriminals. The BlackBasta ransomware leaks referenced an exchange of SmartProxy credentials, for example.\nSmartProxy credentials from BlackBasta leaks\nLogging & Success\nAkiraBot logs its spam progress to submissions.csv, which sometimes includes the AI-generated spam message contents as well. The submissions.csv file from the January 2025 archives show more than 80,000 unique domains that were successfully spammed. The script also logs failed attempts in failed.txt and failed_old.txt. The January 2025 archives showed that only 11,000 domains had failed, including previous runs of the tool. We analyzed all submissions.csv files; deduplicating the results revealed that more than 420,000 unique domains were targeted in total.\nTwo versions of AkiraBot used a Telegram bot for logging success metrics. The scripts monitor.py and monitor_random.py would collect success metrics from the bot and post them to a Telegram channel via API.\nTelegram sending functionality in monitor.py\nTelegram Detail\nThe Telegram functionality, contained in the monitor.py and monitor_random.py scripts, is tied into proxy rotation and CAPTCHA defeat features contained within the bundled JavaScript file script.js.  The monitor.py script utilizes pyautogui to paste the contents of script.js into a browser developer console by scripting CTRL+SHIFT+J, followed by the paste command, eventually executing the JavaScript within the browser console.\npyautogui actions in monitor.py\nThe pasted and executed JavaScript is then responsible for attempting CAPTCHA refreshes and defeats on targeted URLs, reporting the status returned to a JSON file, stats.json. If a proxy rotation is required, to aid further in refreshing the CAPTCHA defeat attempts on a given URL, the monitor.py script handles this as well, rotating the used proxy though the iproxyonline service (fxdx[.]in).\nProxy rotation is generally enabled to avoid geographic or IP-based restrictions when repeatedly attempting to refresh and defeat CAPTCHAs. The Telegram status updates specifically report on proxy rotations and CAPTCHA submissions. Some versions of these scripts have the proxy rotation section commented out, indicating that it is an optional feature.\nTelegram message submission + proxy rotation status in monitor.py\nAll of the analyzed monitor.py and monitor_random.py scripts contain the same Telegram token and chat_id combination.\nTelegram bot data in monitor.py\nThis Telegram chat_id is associated with the following Telegram user data:\n\r\n(bot) username: htscasdasdadwoobot\r\nFirstname: Shadow / hts\r\nLastName: a_zarkawi\r\n\nHTS Telegram bot referenced in monitor.py scripts\nInfrastructure\nThe spam messages frequently rotate the domain used, likely in an attempt to avoid detection. The oldest domain in use is akirateam[.]com, which was registered in January 2022 on a Germany-based IP, 91.195.240[.]94, without further updates until March 2023. The second oldest domain is goservicewrap[.]com, which was registered in April 2024 and resolved to 86.38.202[.]110, a Hostinger IP in Cyprus.\nSeveral AkiraBot domains have interesting connections through historical DNS activity. The subdomain mail.servicewrap-go[.]com briefly shared a CNAME record pointing to 77980.bodis[.]com, which is associated with various malicious activities, including a 2023 malvertising campaign. This domain also received communications from several Windows executable files that were detected as various banking trojans.\nAn odd relationship stood out in anchor links referencing 77980.bodis[.]com: the website unj[.]digital contained anchor links from December 2024 through February 2025 pointing to 77980.bodis[.]com. UNJ Digital’s website describes itself as a digital marketing and software development firm. The subdomain smtp.unj[.]digital also has a CNAME record pointing to 77980.bodis[.]com, fortifying a connection between these hosts. While the website now highlights offering digital content services, as of late 2024 the site showed a focus on increasing marketing revenue.\nScreenshot of content on unj[.]digital circa October 2024\nScreenshot of content on unj[.]digital circa March 2025\nAkira and ServiceWrap SEO\nAkiraBot uses two distinct themes in their SEO offering domain naming conventions: Akira and ServiceWrap. Reviews for both services on TrustPilot are similar: many 5-star reviews with similar, potentially AI-generated contents, and the occasional 1-star review complaining that the site is either a scam or has spammed the person leaving the review.\nThe 5-star reviews tend to follow a pattern where the reviewer has one previous review that was made 1-5 days before the Akira or ServiceWrap review. The review themes are very similar across these 5-star reviews, though the contents and structure are always unique. We believe the actor may be generating some fake reviews, though it is difficult to say with certainty.\nTrustpilot review for servicewrapgo[.]com\nTrustpilot review for useakira[.]com\nTrustpilot review for useakira[.]com\nConclusion\nAkiraBot is a sprawling framework that has undergone multiple iterations to integrate new spamming target technologies and evade website defenses. We expect this campaign to continue to evolve as website hosting providers adapt defenses to deter spam. The author or authors have invested significant effort in this bot’s ability to bypass commonly used CAPTCHA technologies, which demonstrates that the operators are motivated to violate service provider protections.\nAkiraBot’s use of LLM-generated spam message content demonstrates the emerging challenges that AI poses to defending websites against spam attacks. The easiest indicators to block are the rotating set of domains used to sell the Akira and ServiceWrap SEO offerings, as there is no longer a consistent approach in the spam message contents as there were with previous campaigns selling the services of these firms.\nSentinelLABS thanks the OpenAI security team for their collaboration and continued efforts in deterring bad actors from abusing their services. The OpenAI team shared the following response following their investigation:\n“We’re grateful to SentinelOne for sharing their research. Distributing output from our services for spam is against our policies. The API key involved is disabled, and we’re continuing to investigate and will disable any associated assets. We take misuse seriously and are continually improving our systems to detect abuse.”\nIndicators of Compromise\nAkira & ServiceWrap Domains\nAkiraBot Tool Archive SHA-1\n09ec44b6d3555a0397142b4308825483b479bf5a\n0de065d58b367ffb28ce53bc1dc023f95a6d0b89\n13de9fcd4e7c36d32594924975b7ef2b91614556\n2322964ea57312747ae9d1e918811201a0c86e9c\n253684ea43cb0456a6fec5728e1091ff8fcb27cf\n36b4e424ce8082d7606bb9f677f97c0f594f254d\n3a443c72995254400da30fe203f3fbf287629969\n3a7cc815b921166006f31c1065dadfeb8d5190e6\n4d24dd5c166fa471554ed781180e353e6b9642b7\n51ec20e5356bbebd43c03faae56fca4c3bbe318e\n55affc664472c4657c8534e0508636394eac8828\n5620b527dfc71e2ee7efb2e22a0441b60fd67b84\n5fde3180373c420cfa5cfdea7f227a1e1fe6936c\n62e66bae4b892593009d5261d898356b6d0be3ef\n6b65c296d9e1cda5af2f7dab94ce8e163b2a4ca8\n6c56b986893dd1de83151510f4b6260613c5fbb9\n6f342ff77cd43921210d144a403b8abb1e541a8b\n7129194c63ae262c814da8045879aed7a037f196\n71464c4f145c9a43ade999d385a9260aabcbf66d\n730192b0f62e37d4d57bae9ff14ec8671fbf051e\n769aa6ab69154ca87ccba0535e0180a985c21a0c\n76aab3ab0f3f16cf30d7913ff767f67a116ff1e7\n853fde052316be7887474996538b31f6ac0c3963\n9d43494c6f87414c67533cce5ec86754311631fc\n9f6ed2427e959e92eb1699024f457d87fa7b5279\naa72065673dc543e6bf627c7479bfe8a5e42a9c4\naac26242f4209bc59c82c8f223fcf2f152ce44bc\nb643a1f2c4eb436db26763d5e2527f6bebe8bcbf\nbbd754e36aee4702b9f20b90d509248945add4ea\ncb194612ed003eaf8d8cf6ed3731f21f3edeb161\ncc63ee921c29f47612096c34d6ee3ef244b33db2\ne12c6911997d7c2af5550b7e989f1dc57b6733b8\neae675812c4274502051d6f2d36348f77a8464a0\nf1c7c5d0870fd0abb7e419f2c2ba8df42fa74667\nf2e71c9cbc4a18482a11ca3f54f2c958973360b4\nfb7fdcc2fe11e95065a0ce9041348984427ca0f4","enclosure":{"url":"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot-ftr.jpg","length":"614617","type":"image/jpeg"},"dc:creator":"Alex Delamotte &amp; Jim Walter","content":"AkiraBot uses OpenAI to generate custom outreach messages to spam chat widgets and website contact forms at scale.","contentSnippet":"AkiraBot uses OpenAI to generate custom outreach messages to spam chat widgets and website contact forms at scale.","guid":"https://www.sentinelone.com/?post_type=labs&p=117809","categories":["MalSpam","OpenAI"],"isoDate":"2025-04-09T15:00:36.000Z","tag":"intel"},{"creator":"LABScon","title":"LABScon24 Replay | A Walking Red Flag (With Yellow Stars)","link":"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/labscon24-replay-a-walking-red-flag-with-yellow-stars/","pubDate":"Mon, 31 Mar 2025 13:00:23 +0000","content:encoded":"<p>APT40 used CTFs at Hainan University to recruit hackers and source software vulnerabilities for operations.

Observed document lures were themed around issues pertaining to the Ukraine military and the <a href=\"https://cyble.com/blog/unc1151-strikes-again-unveiling-their-tactics-against-ukraines-ministry-of-defence/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">likely targeting</a> of the Ministry of Defense.</p>\n<p>SentinelLABS has observed new activity with multiple weaponized Excel documents containing lures pertaining to the interests of the Ukraine government, the Ukraine military and domestic Belarusian opposition. While some of the TTPs we have observed overlap with previous reporting, others are new, including adaptations of previously observed payloads such as PicassoLoader.</p>\n<h2>Weaponized XLS 1 | &#8220;Political Prisoners in Minsk Courts&#8221;</h2>\n<p>SentinelLABS analyzed an attack that started with a Google Drive shared document landing in the target’s inbox. The email originated from an account using the name “Vladimir Nikiforech” (<code>vladimir.nikiforeach@gmail[.]com</code>). The email link pointed to a downloadable RAR archive, which according to the internal timestamps was created on 2025-01-14 00:47:54, containing a malicious Excel workbook (<code>ebb30fd99c2e6cbae392c337df5876759e53730d</code>) with the file name <code>политзаключенные(по судам минска).xls</code> (“Political prisoners (across courts of Minsk).xls”).</p>\n<p>The title of the lure indicates an interesting shift in Ghostwriter targeting. Although attribution for the 2021 Ghostwriter campaign <a href=\"https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/2699483/Ghostwriter-Report-Final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pointed to</a> the Belarus state, this is the first time we have seen lures directly aimed at Belarus government opposition. The timing of the attack could have been motivated by the presidential election that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Belarusian_presidential_election\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">took place</a> shortly after on Jan 26, 2025.</p>\n<p>The XLS document contains an obfuscated VBA macro which is activated when the document is opened and the user allows Office macros to run.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_114850\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-114850\" style=\"width: 1837px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_3.jpg\" alt=\"Obfuscated macro inside the XLS spreadsheet\" width=\"1837\" height=\"752\" class=\"size-full wp-image-114850\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_3.jpg 1837w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_3-300x123.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_3-1024x419.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_3-768x314.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_3-1536x629.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1837px) 100vw, 1837px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-114850\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Obfuscated macro inside the XLS spreadsheet</figcaption></figure>\n<p>On execution, the macro writes a file to <code>%Temp%\\Realtek(r)Audio.dll</code>.</p>\n<p>The DLL file is loaded with the following command line invocation:</p>\n<pre>\r\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\regsvr32.exe /u /s \"C:\\Temp\\Realtek(r)Audio.dll”\r\n</pre>\n<p>This starts the standard Windows process <code>regsvr32.exe</code>, which calls the <code>DllUnregisterServer</code> function implemented inside the DLL; the function then loads and executes the .NET assembly described next.</p>\n<p>Analysis of <code>Dwnldr.dll</code> shows that it is a DLL file with a .NET assembly embedded inside.

It does so by decrypting additional code of the assembly. It also uses a clever evasion technique, altering its own PE header in memory and breaking internal links to the .NET assembly. This makes it impossible for security products to parse it as a .NET module.</p>\n<p>During code execution, after the protection layer passes control to core functionality, the Downloader writes a decoy Excel workbook file to <code>%AppData%\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\temp.xlsx</code> and downloads additional file(s) from the Web.</p>\n<p>The <code>temp.xlsx</code> decoy file (<code>18151b3801bd716b5a33cfc85dbdc4ba84a00314</code>) is immediately opened in Excel in an attempt to make the victim believe that it contains the original content of the <code>политзаключенные (по судам минска).xls</code> file.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_114854\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-114854\" style=\"width: 1999px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_11.jpg\" alt=\"Decoy document containing lists of people with criminal charges, prosecutors’ and judges’ names\" width=\"1999\" height=\"803\" class=\"size-full wp-image-114854\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_11.jpg 1999w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_11-300x121.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_11-1024x411.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_11-768x309.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_11-1536x617.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-114854\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Decoy document containing lists of people with criminal charges, prosecutors’ and judges’ names</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The spreadsheet contains the names of people with criminal charges along with the names of prosecutors and judges: content that invites the reader to believe it could be leaked from a government source.

We confirmed that an identical file can be found online, located on a web site that is nearly identical to the one used by attackers.

However, based on the code analysis, we believe that the real targets receive an actual DLL. We assume that such a targeted payload delivery process is carefully controlled by the attackers and that they deliver the payload only after confirming the requesting client&#8217;s profile (browser user agent, IP address of the client, and matching time of the operation window). <a href=\"https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/menace-unleashed-excel-file-deploys-cobalt-strike-at-ukraine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Research</a> in a previous campaign found that a Cobalt Strike payload was delivered to targets only if the host IP was located in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Given the timing and targeting of the attack, we hypothesized that it may not have been an isolated incident. Further research led us to discover other samples closely resembling Weaponized XLS 1, suggesting that multiple attacks using the same techniques had been planned or executed. The samples used in these suspected attacks are described below.</p>\n<h2>Weaponized XLS 2 | Ukraine Gov “Anti-Corruption Initiative”</h2>\n<p>A file bearing the Ukrainian name <code>Zrazok.xls</code> (“Sample.xls”) is an XLS file (<code>301ffdf0c7b67e01fd2119c321e7ae09b7835afc</code>) with an obfuscated VBA macro embedded. However, the script code and obfuscation technique are different from the case we discussed earlier.</p>\n<p>For this script, the attackers used a popular obfuscator tool called <a href=\"https://github.com/sevagas/macro_pack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Macropack</a>, an open-source but seemingly abandoned project originally developed for red-teaming and penetration testing exercises.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_114845\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-114845\" style=\"width: 1837px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_8.jpg\" alt=\"Macropack-obfuscated VBA macro found inside the spreadsheet\" width=\"1837\" height=\"752\" class=\"size-full wp-image-114845\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_8.jpg 1837w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_8-300x123.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_8-1024x419.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_8-768x314.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_8-1536x629.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1837px) 100vw, 1837px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-114845\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Macropack-obfuscated VBA macro found inside the spreadsheet</figcaption></figure>\n<p>As in the previous case, once the macro code is executed, the .NET ConfuserEx-obfuscated Downloader DLL (written to <code>%AppData%\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\bruhdll32.dll</code>) is loaded with <code>rundll32.exe</code> and respective commandline arguments to run an exported function.

The actor behind Ghostwriter campaigns is closely linked with Belarusian government espionage efforts, while most commonly reported under the APT names UNC1151 (Mandiant) or UAC-0057 (CERT-UA). Some public reports may use the term “Ghostwriter APT” interchangeably to refer to both the threat actor and its associated campaigns.\nPrevious research on the evolution of Ghostwriter noted how it operated successfully across a range of platforms, blending information manipulation with hacking to target a number of European countries. Reporting throughout 2022 to 2024 described activity in which malicious Excel documents were used to deliver PicassoLoader and Cobalt Strike payloads. Observed document lures were themed around issues pertaining to the Ukraine military and the likely targeting of the Ministry of Defense.\nSentinelLABS has observed new activity with multiple weaponized Excel documents containing lures pertaining to the interests of the Ukraine government, the Ukraine military and domestic Belarusian opposition. While some of the TTPs we have observed overlap with previous reporting, others are new, including adaptations of previously observed payloads such as PicassoLoader.\nWeaponized XLS 1 | “Political Prisoners in Minsk Courts”\nSentinelLABS analyzed an attack that started with a Google Drive shared document landing in the target’s inbox. The email originated from an account using the name “Vladimir Nikiforech” (vladimir.nikiforeach@gmail[.]com). The email link pointed to a downloadable RAR archive, which according to the internal timestamps was created on 2025-01-14 00:47:54, containing a malicious Excel workbook (ebb30fd99c2e6cbae392c337df5876759e53730d) with the file name политзаключенные(по судам минска).xls (“Political prisoners (across courts of Minsk).xls”).\nThe title of the lure indicates an interesting shift in Ghostwriter targeting. Although attribution for the 2021 Ghostwriter campaign pointed to the Belarus state, this is the first time we have seen lures directly aimed at Belarus government opposition. The timing of the attack could have been motivated by the presidential election that took place shortly after on Jan 26, 2025.\nThe XLS document contains an obfuscated VBA macro which is activated when the document is opened and the user allows Office macros to run.\nObfuscated macro inside the XLS spreadsheet\nOn execution, the macro writes a file to %Temp%\\Realtek(r)Audio.dll.\nThe DLL file is loaded with the following command line invocation:\n\r\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\regsvr32.exe /u /s \"C:\\Temp\\Realtek(r)Audio.dll”\r\n\nThis starts the standard Windows process regsvr32.exe, which calls the DllUnregisterServer function implemented inside the DLL; the function then loads and executes the .NET assembly described next.\nAnalysis of Dwnldr.dll shows that it is a DLL file with a .NET assembly embedded inside. The file is protected with ConfuserEx – a publicly available tool that helps to obfuscate .NET programs and observed in previous Ghostwriter campaigns.\nThe DLL file hosts a payload that appears to be a simplified variant of PicassoDownloader, a malware family also linked to Ghostwriter activity. The internal filename (Dwnldr.dll) was previously used by the Ghostwriter threat actor; however, this variant bears only high-level similarities to previous versions, with significant changes to the underlying code, possibly to make it a cheaper and more expendable tool.\nAs a part of application protection provided by the obfuscator, the Downloader creates a copy of itself in memory, and then modifies it. It does so by decrypting additional code of the assembly. It also uses a clever evasion technique, altering its own PE header in memory and breaking internal links to the .NET assembly. This makes it impossible for security products to parse it as a .NET module.\nDuring code execution, after the protection layer passes control to core functionality, the Downloader writes a decoy Excel workbook file to %AppData%\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\temp.xlsx and downloads additional file(s) from the Web.\nThe temp.xlsx decoy file (18151b3801bd716b5a33cfc85dbdc4ba84a00314) is immediately opened in Excel in an attempt to make the victim believe that it contains the original content of the политзаключенные (по судам минска).xls file.\nDecoy document containing lists of people with criminal charges, prosecutors’ and judges’ names\nThe spreadsheet contains the names of people with criminal charges along with the names of prosecutors and judges: content that invites the reader to believe it could be leaked from a government source. However, the information was already in the public domain and can be found on the website of a proscribed Belarusian human rights organization, Spring96.\nOnce the decoy Excel file is opened, the Downloader attempts to fetch the next stage from the following URL:\n\r\nhttps://everythingandthedog[.]shop/petsblog/2020/2/25/tips-for-taking-difficult-dogs-on-a-walk.jpg\r\n\nThe JPG image file fetched from the C2\nWe note that the .shop top level domain was also reported in other Ghostwriter activity seen in 2024.\nWhen the malware issues the HTTP request, it uses a hardcoded User-Agent string:\n\r\nMozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/555.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/97.0.4692.71 Safari/537.36\r\n\nThe fetched file (8d2bb96e69df059f279d97989690ce3e556a8318) is a benign JPEG file, originating from publicly available photo stock, with no extra payload or any hidden cave where code could be embedded. We confirmed that an identical file can be found online, located on a web site that is nearly identical to the one used by attackers. It would seem the attackers not only reused the JPG file contents from a legitimate website but also copied its original URL, changing only the top level domain:\n\r\nhttps://www.everythingandthedog.com/petsblog/2020/2/25/tips-for-taking-difficult-dogs-on-a-walk.\r\n\nOnce the file is downloaded, it is renamed and then saved to %APPDATA%\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\SystemCertificates\\CertificateCenter.dll.\nLater, it is registered to load during autostart by leveraging the Registry Run key:\n\r\nHKCU\\System\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\Microsoft Certificate Center\r\n\nwith its value pointing to expanded environment variable string:\n\r\nrundll32.exe C:\\Users\\\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\SystemCertificates\\CertificateCenter.dll,#1\r\n\nThis Registry entry makes rundll32.exe load the DLL and execute its exported function with ordinal 1 whenever a user logs on.\nOverview of the malware stages for Weaponized XLS 1\nDuring our analysis we only observed the benign JPG file being downloaded. However, based on the code analysis, we believe that the real targets receive an actual DLL. We assume that such a targeted payload delivery process is carefully controlled by the attackers and that they deliver the payload only after confirming the requesting client’s profile (browser user agent, IP address of the client, and matching time of the operation window). Research in a previous campaign found that a Cobalt Strike payload was delivered to targets only if the host IP was located in Ukraine.\nGiven the timing and targeting of the attack, we hypothesized that it may not have been an isolated incident. Further research led us to discover other samples closely resembling Weaponized XLS 1, suggesting that multiple attacks using the same techniques had been planned or executed. The samples used in these suspected attacks are described below.\nWeaponized XLS 2 | Ukraine Gov “Anti-Corruption Initiative”\nA file bearing the Ukrainian name Zrazok.xls (“Sample.xls”) is an XLS file (301ffdf0c7b67e01fd2119c321e7ae09b7835afc) with an obfuscated VBA macro embedded. However, the script code and obfuscation technique are different from the case we discussed earlier.\nFor this script, the attackers used a popular obfuscator tool called Macropack, an open-source but seemingly abandoned project originally developed for red-teaming and penetration testing exercises.\nMacropack-obfuscated VBA macro found inside the spreadsheet\nAs in the previous case, once the macro code is executed, the .NET ConfuserEx-obfuscated Downloader DLL (written to %AppData%\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\bruhdll32.dll) is loaded with rundll32.exe and respective commandline arguments to run an exported function. After this, the new module drops a decoy XLS file and opens it with Excel.\nThe decoy document prepared for a Ukrainian reader (an action plan for anti-corruption initiative in government organisations in Ukraine)\nThis module attempts to download the next stage from the following URL (unavailable at the time of writing):\n\r\nhttps://sciencealert[.]shop/images/2024/11/black-hole-coronaxx.jpg\r\n\nWhen the malware issues the HTTP request it uses a hardcoded User-Agent string that differs slightly from the previous case:\n\r\nMozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/97.0.4692.71 Safari/537.36\r\n\nNotably, this file (52e894acf0e14d27f8997d2174c1f40d6d87bba9) was previously uploaded to VirusTotal on December 19, 2024.\nImage file fetched from the malicious URL\nAs with the previous case, the image file and its URL path appear to be copied from a public blog, published on Nov 16, 2024:\n\r\nhttps://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-reveal-the-shape-of-a-black-holes-corona-for-the-very-first-time\r\n\nAgain, the file name and the path on the malicious server were nearly identical to the legitimate one, with the actor changing only the top level domain from .com to .shop.\n\r\nhttps://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/black-hole-coronaxx.jpg\r\n\nIn this case, the downloaded file is expected to be an archive in a GZIP format. Once downloaded, the malware decompresses it and saves it to the following location:\n\r\n%APPDATA%\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\SystemCertificates\\CertificateCenter.dll\r\n\nIt also creates an additional text config file at:\n\r\n%APPDATA%\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\SystemCertificates\\config\r\n\nThe config file contains the following data:\n\r\n<Project xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003\">\r\n <PropertyGroup>\r\n  <AssemblyName>Certificate</AssemblyName>\r\n  <OutputPath>Bin\\</OutputPath>\r\n </PropertyGroup>\r\n <ItemGroup>\r\n  <Compile Include=\"CertificateCenter.dll\" />\r\n </ItemGroup>\r\n <Target Name=\"Build\">\r\n  <MakeDir Directories=\"$(OutputPath)\" Condition=\"!Exists('$(OutputPath)')\" />\r\n  <Csc Sources=\"@(Compile)\" OutputAssembly=\"$(OutputPath)$(AssemblyName).exe\" />\r\n </Target>\r\n</Project>\r\n\nThe config file is used by the Downloader to execute MSBuild.exe, instructing it to build a new application:\n\r\nC:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\MSBuild.exe %AppData%\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\SystemCertificates\\config\r\n\nThis suggests that the CertificateCenter.dll file is not a binary as the file extension would suggest but rather contains program source code. The command, if successful, produces an executable file in the following location:\n\r\n%AppData%\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\SystemCertificates\\Bin\\Certificate.exe\r\n\nand likely contains the next stage of the infection chain.\nOverview of the malware stages for Weaponized XLS 2\nWeaponized XLS 3 | “Supplies for Ukraine Armed Forces”\nA file bearing the Ukrainian name Донесення 5 реч - зразок.xls (“Report 5 items – sample.xls”) is an XLS file (9d110879d101bcaec7accc3001295a53dc33371f) hosting another VBA payload obfuscated with Macropack.\nAs in the previous cases, once the macro code is executed, the .NET ConfuserEx-obfuscated Downloader DLL (written to %AppData%\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\bruhdll32.dll) is loaded with rundll32.exe and respective commandline arguments to run an exported function. After this, the new module drops a decoy XLS file on disk and opens it with Excel.\nThe decoy document prepared for a Ukrainian reader (a report template for the Ukrainian armed forces supplies)\nAgain, the malware uses the same payload retrieval technique and downloads a JPG file from yet another .shop domain:\n\r\nhttps://cookingwithbooks[.]shop/images/qwerty.jpg\r\n\nThe URL is unavailable at the time of writing, but data from VirusTotal indicates that the downloaded file is identical to the black hole image described above in the Weaponized XLS 2 section. The malware logic is also identical with Weaponized XLS 2.\nWeaponized XLS 4 & 5 | Variations on a Theme\nIn addition to the previous findings, we discovered further related XLS files that were similarly weaponized. The files Донесення 5 реч фонд зборів- зразок.xls (“Report 5 items collection fund- sample.xls”; 2c06c01f9261fe80b627695a0ed746aa8f1f3744) and Додаток 8 реч новий.xls (“Addition 8 items new – sample.xls”; 853da593d2a489c2bd72a284a362d7c68c3a4d4c) were first uploaded from Ukraine in Feb 2025.\nBoth files contain a Macropack-obfuscated VBA macro; however, they differ in structure. Functionally, both drop a DLL to the previously noted path %AppData%\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\bruhdll32.dll.\nAgain, the DLL is loaded with rundll32.exe and respective command line arguments to execute an exported function. Next, the victim sees a decoy workbook open in Excel.\n\nThe decoy documents prepared for a Ukrainian reader (a report template for the Ukrainian armed forces supplies)\nThe decoys are similar and the obfuscation technique, code structure, and the embedded URL are common to both:\n\r\nhttps://pigglywigglystores[.]shop/wp-content/themes/fp-wp-j-piggly-wiggly-nc/resources/images/logo/logo.png\r\n\nThe User-Agent string in the HTTP request, however, is different, with the operating system and architectures specified as “Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64”.\n\r\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/97.0.4692.71 Safari/537.36 Edg/97.0.1072.71\r\n\nThese variants of the malware also contain another embedded .NET DLL, internally referred to as LibCMD from the original filename LibCMD.dll (4ae6b8adc980ba8a212b838f3ca6a9718d9a3757). This is a small file, whose purpose is simply to start cmd.exe and connect to stdin/stdout.\nThe file contains a tampered PE link timestamp. It is never saved to disk; instead, it is loaded dynamically in memory as a .NET assembly and executed.\nOverview of the malware stages for Weaponized XLS 4 & 5\nAttribution\nAnalysis of techniques used by threat actors can often be helpful in establishing the origin of the attack and the malware it uses. In this case, the obfuscation techniques are quite specific across all the samples we analyzed, allowing us to establish a medium confidence link between them and a malware cluster known as PicassoLoader, a downloader toolkit.\nPicassoLoader has been used in cyber attacks targeting government, military, and civilian entities in Ukraine and Poland and is exclusively associated with the Ghostwriter threat actor (aka UNC1151, UAC-0057, Blue Dev 4, Moonscape, TA445).\nThroughout 2024, Ghostwriter has repeatedly used a combination of Excel workbooks containing Macropack-obfuscated VBA macros and dropped embedded .NET downloaders obfuscated with ConfuserEx. In our case, the Downloader malware appears to be a simplified implementation of the PicassoLoader.\nConclusion\nThe Ghostwriter threat actor has been consistently active in the past years and continues its attempts to compromise targets aligned with the interests of Belarus and its closest ally, Russia. It has mounted multiple attacks reported by CERT UA and other security researchers throughout 2024.\nWhile Belarus doesn’t actively participate in military campaigns in the war in Ukraine, cyber threat actors associated with it appear to have no reservation about conducting cyberespionage operations against Ukrainian targets.\nThe campaign described in this publication also serves as confirmation that Ghostwriter is closely tied with the interests of the Belarusian government waging an aggressive pursuit of its opposition and organizations associated with it.\n\nWe would like to express our thanks to partners in the region, including RESIDENT.NGO and others who remain unnamed, for their invaluable collaboration. \nOrganizations that believe they may have been targeted by threat actors involved in this campaign are invited to reach out to the SentinelLABS team via ThreatTips@sentinelone.com.\nIndicators of Compromise\nWeaponized Excel Workbooks and Decoys\nSHA-1\nFile Name\n\n\n18151b3801bd716b5a33cfc85dbdc4ba84a00314\ntemp.xlsx\n\n\n2c06c01f9261fe80b627695a0ed746aa8f1f3744\nДонесення 5 реч фонд зборів- зразок.xls\n\n\n301ffdf0c7b67e01fd2119c321e7ae09b7835afc\nZrazok.xls\n\n\n853da593d2a489c2bd72a284a362d7c68c3a4d4c\nДодаток 8 реч новий.xls\n\n\n9d110879d101bcaec7accc3001295a53dc33371f\nДонесення 5 реч – зразок.xls\n\n\nebb30fd99c2e6cbae392c337df5876759e53730d\nполитзаключенные (по судам минска).xls\n\n\n\n\nDownloaders\nLibCMD helper file\nC2 Domains\namericandeliriumsociety[.]shop\ncookingwithbooks[.]shop\neverythingandthedog[.]shop\npigglywigglystores[.]shop\nsciencealert[.]shop","enclosure":{"url":"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter-ftr.jpg","length":"411675","type":"image/jpeg"},"dc:creator":"Tom Hegel","content":"Latest Ghostwriter campaign brings Belarusian opposition into its sights for the first time as it continues weaponizing XLS docs to drop malware.","contentSnippet":"Latest Ghostwriter campaign brings Belarusian opposition into its sights for the first time as it continues weaponizing XLS docs to drop malware.","guid":"https://www.sentinelone.com/?post_type=labs&p=114319","categories":["Belarus","Russia","Ukraine"],"isoDate":"2025-02-25T10:55:52.000Z","tag":"intel"},{"creator":"Alex Delamotte, Aleksandar Milenkoski &amp; Dakota Cary","title":"Censorship as a Service | Leak Reveals Public-Private Collaboration to Monitor Chinese Cyberspace","link":"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/censorship-as-a-service-leak-reveals-public-private-collaboration-to-monitor-chinese-cyberspace/","pubDate":"Fri, 21 Feb 2025 10:55:35 +0000","content:encoded":"<h2>Executive Summary</h2>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">SentinelLABS has analyzed a data leak containing infrastructure details and work logs from employees of a state-affiliated private sector security firm in China.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The leaked data contains references to web content monitoring services used to enforce censorship for public and private sector customers.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Work logs reveal that the firm provided bespoke monitoring services to a state-owned enterprise when a corruption scandal impacted this organization, providing insights into how the state and CCP coordinate with some cybersecurity companies to manage fallout from corruption scandals.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>SentinelLABS has analyzed a data leak from TopSec (北京天融), a Chinese cybersecurity firm offering services such as Endpoint Detection &amp; Response (EDR) and vulnerability scanning, while offering boutique solutions to align with government initiatives and intelligence requirements.</p>\n<p>The data leak includes a document with 7,000+ lines of work logs and code used to orchestrate infrastructure for the firm’s DevOps practices and downstream customers and includes scripts that connect to several Chinese government hostnames, academic institutions and news sites.</p>\n<p>We identified work logs and system features that indicate TopSec is likely enabling content moderation for internet censorship purposes, a key <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/community-watch-chinas-vision-for-the-future-of-the-internet/\">strategy</a> used by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to monitor and control public opinion on issues that the state deems contentious or antisocial.</p>\n<p>Further, we found evidence indicating that TopSec provided bespoke services to a state-owned enterprise on the date that a corruption investigation was announced targeting the organization’s top official.</p>\n<p>The Chinese cybersecurity market has long been a mystery for many researchers in the west. Unlike Europe and parts of the Middle East, which foster some degree of collaboration, the Chinese cybersecurity market is obscured behind the wall that divides China from the global internet. This finding reveals not only the types of technologies that are used by a prestigious Chinese tech firm, but how they are providing security services to private and public sector customers inside China.</p>\n<h2>TopSec</h2>\n<p>TopSec is a provider of monitoring and IT security solutions, as well as big data and cloud services. Established in 1995, TopSec prides itself on its long history and prioritizes national cyberspace security as a core element of its mission statement.</p>\n<p>Company registration details reveal that TopSec holds over 1,000 patents, 87 software copyrights, and has 12 subsidiaries. The company is also a <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/sleight-of-hand-how-china-weaponizes-software-vulnerability/\">Tier 1 vulnerability supplier</a> to China’s civilian intelligence ministry. According to TopSec&#8217;s 2024 annual corporate report for shareholders, the company has been offering cloud monitoring services–including IT security monitoring capabilities–since 2004. By 2020, these TopSec services were in use across all 31 of China’s administrative regions.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_7.jpg\" alt=\"Description of TopSec services\" width=\"1999\" height=\"128\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-114588\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_7.jpg 1999w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_7-300x19.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_7-1024x66.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_7-768x49.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_7-1536x98.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px\" /><br />\n<figure id=\"attachment_114604\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-114604\" style=\"width: 696px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-14.27.08.jpg\" alt=\"Description of TopSec services\" width=\"696\" height=\"130\" class=\"size-full wp-image-114604\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-14.27.08.jpg 696w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-14.27.08-300x56.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-114604\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Description of TopSec services</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1999\" height=\"683\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-114591\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_4.jpg 1999w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_4-300x103.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_4-1024x350.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_4-768x262.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_4-1536x525.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px\" /><br />\n<figure id=\"attachment_114600\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-114600\" style=\"width: 782px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_12.jpg\" alt=\"TopSec&#039;s 2024 annual corporate report\" width=\"782\" height=\"266\" class=\"size-full wp-image-114600\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_12.jpg 782w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_12-300x102.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_12-768x261.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 782px) 100vw, 782px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-114600\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">TopSec&#8217;s 2024 annual corporate report (<a href=\"https://file.finance.sina.com.cn/211.154.219.97:9494/MRGG/CNSESZ_STOCK/2024/2024-4/2024-04-20/10013439.PDF\" target=\"_blank\">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>The leaked documents we analyzed reference multiple organizations in both the private and public sectors, likely customers or otherwise associated with TopSec, a selection of which is listed below.

The main file we analyzed (SHA-1: <code>1bccef07ad0348e326248fe321259e2bd8f8cf8b</code>) contains numerous work logs, which are a description of the work performed by a TopSec employee and the amount of time the task took, often accompanied by scripts, commands, or data related to the task.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_114590\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-114590\" style=\"width: 755px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_5.jpg\" alt=\"Example of work logs from the file along with English translation\" width=\"755\" height=\"154\" class=\"size-full wp-image-114590\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_5.jpg 755w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_5-300x61.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 755px) 100vw, 755px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-114590\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Example of work logs from the file along with English translation</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In addition to work logs, the leak contains many commands and playbooks used to administrate TopSec’s services via multiple common DevOps and infrastructure technologies that are used worldwide, including Ansible, Docker, ElasticSearch, Gitlab, Kafka, Kibana, Kubernetes, and Redis. There are many artifacts showing JSON data for web APIs used by TopSec services. There are also network configurations, SSH and port mapping commands with hardcoded credentials, which present a huge security risk should anyone obtain access to the environment–and would likely provide access to TopSec’s downstream customers as well.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_114598\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-114598\" style=\"width: 686px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_14.jpg\" alt=\"Ansible commands from leaked file used to access infrastructure\" width=\"686\" height=\"190\" class=\"size-full wp-image-114598\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_14.jpg 686w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_14-300x83.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-114598\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ansible commands from leaked file used to access infrastructure</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The leaked file is very large, disorganized, and the formatting is inconsistent, which complicates analysis. It is highly likely that we have not identified all capabilities outlined in the leak. Our analysis approach focused on translating the Chinese language content, identifying known technologies, and identifying interesting references in the commands and API JSON artifacts, particularly those where there were upticks in work logs performed around specific dates documented in the work logs or web API data.</p>\n<p>The data leak includes a file that starts with infrastructure management code, including some which initializes several Docker images to enable security monitoring related features. These containers run probes, which are likely used for network monitoring. We are unable to fully assess the capabilities of these containers without access to them. However, the containers are run with several flags such as <code>--privileged</code> and <code>--net host</code> that suggest deep access to the monitored data. This may indicate the probes inspect network traffic or perform privileged tasks in the deployment environment.</p>\n<p>Deeper in the file, there are work logs which contain dates indicating when certain tasks were performed and notes from the TopSec staff who worked on specific infrastructure projects. One project referenced repeatedly is called Sparta or Sparda, with the spelling changing regularly. Notes from the TopSec staff indicate that Sparta handles sensitive word processing, an indication of censorship keyword monitoring.</p>\n<p>On a technical level, Sparta is a framework that uses GraphQL APIs to receive content from downstream web applications. Work logs indicate that TopSec migrated from a system called Apollo, which is plausibly a reference to <a href=\"https://github.com/apollographql\">Apollo-GraphQL</a>, an open-source framework offered by a company based in San Francisco. The work logs also indicate that Sparta is equipped to process Chinese language characters. This suggests that TopSec likely developed Sparta as an in-house solution that is tailored to the localized needs of TopSec’s customers and does not rely on a US-based solution.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we observed a note indicating that detection alerts considered severe are likely distributed to internal teams via WeChat for prioritized handling. WeChat is a widely-used messaging and social media platform in China, known for its broad range of features, including messaging, social networking, and payment services. Its integration into daily life makes it an essential tool for communication and business operations within the country.</p>\n<pre>\r\nSevere monitoring events are sent to corporate WeChat\r\n</pre>\n<p>Since WeChat operates under Chinese regulations, there are significant implications regarding data privacy and government access. Under Chinese laws, such as the <a href=\"https://digichina.stanford.edu/work/translation-cybersecurity-law-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china-effective-june-1-2017/\">Cybersecurity Law</a>, companies like Tencent, which owns WeChat, are required to cooperate with government entities, allowing them to access data when requested.</p>\n<h2>Web Content Monitoring</h2>\n<p>Our analysis found that TopSec’s capabilities include web content monitoring, as indicated by references to a service called <code>Website Monitoring Service</code> and detection events with internal identifiers prefixed with <code>Web</code>, such as <code>WebTamper</code>, <code>WebHiddenLink</code>, <code>WebAvailHttp</code>, <code>WebDns</code>, <code>WebTr</code>, and <code>WebSensitive</code>.</p>\n<p>This feature of the platform is likely part of what would have been proposed in response to the bid issued by the Shanghai Pudong Bureau for the &#8220;Cloud Monitoring Service Project&#8221;, offering the Bureau tools to monitor website security and content as part of their broader surveillance and compliance efforts.</p>\n<pre>\r\nInspect website monitoring-related services\r\n[ . . . ]\r\n[2024-06-12T18:00:00 to 2024-06-12T22:00:00 Event volume: 553] 2024-06-12T18:00:00 to 2024-06-12T22:00:00 Event volume: 553\r\nWebSensitive 56\r\nWebTamper 149\r\nWebHiddenLink 348\r\n</pre>\n<p>While the exact logic behind how the Web events are triggered remains unclear, the event names and metadata present in the documents provide insight into the purpose of some of these events. For instance, the <code>WebAvailHttp</code> event is likely triggered when a website is considered unavailable due to its response time (measured in milliseconds as <code>respTimeMs</code> in the figure below) exceeding a predefined threshold (<code>respThresholdMs</code>).</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_114595\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-114595\" style=\"width: 330px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_17.jpg\" alt=\"Metadata on the WebAvailHttp event\" width=\"330\" height=\"357\" class=\"size-full wp-image-114595\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_17.jpg 330w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_17-277x300.jpg 277w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 330px) 100vw, 330px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-114595\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Metadata on the <em>WebAvailHttp</em> event</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Further, the <code>WebHiddenLink</code> event is likely triggered when web content contains hidden links — links that obscure their destination or mislead users, posing a security risk.

These words are related to political criticism, violence, or pornography, and are central to China&#8217;s domestic Internet censorship efforts aimed at ensuring compliance with government policies. Detecting the presence of such words in web content helps prevent the dissemination of information considered inappropriate or harmful by PRC authorities.</p>\n<pre>\r\nAssist the product to check for missed scans and manual analysis and marking errors of sensitive word events\r\n</pre>\n<p>TopSec’s ability to detect sensitive words demonstrates the impact that state policies related to the cyber domain have on the design and implementation of monitoring solutions developed by the private sector in China. These policies shape the strategies and technologies used to monitor, filter, and control online content, ensuring that IT systems comply with governmental regulations and censorship guidelines.</p>\n<p><code>WebSensitive</code> alerts may be used by private sector organizations to monitor user-generated content on their websites in order to trigger actions such as issuing warnings, deleting content, or restricting access when sensitive words are detected. Government entities may also consume these alerts to track the presence of sensitive words on their own websites or across broader online spaces to enforce compliance with national censorship regulations. For example, the latter may have been an objective of the previously mentioned &#8220;Cloud Monitoring Service Project&#8221; by the Shanghai Pudong Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security.</p>\n<p>We observed a task list indicating a focused effort to ensure consistent monitoring for sensitive words between 7:00 AM and 8:00 AM on the 14th (converted from GMT to China Standard Time), with the month and year not specified.

The CCP’s strategy of controlling information is multifaceted and requires significant investment in resources that enable the monitoring and alteration of content that citizens engage with. While there are still many unknown factors regarding how such censorship is applied, these findings yield insights into how collaboration occurs between the government and other entities in China.</p>\n<p>The nature of how this data was leaked remains unclear, but the materials show that TopSec engineers were documenting their work in a highly granular way that included entire commands used to perform the outlined tasks. Considering the types of information in this leak, organizations should evaluate how their systems and infrastructure engineers are logging work. Proper credential management is essential to securing sensitive environments. Infrastructure engineers should rely on a secrets manager that integrates with the CI/CD pipeline rather than running commands from playbooks that include hardcoded credentials. This results in only variable names being stored in commands instead of sensitive credentials and lowers the likelihood that an unexpected disclosure could result in further compromise.</p>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"Executive Summary\nSentinelLABS has analyzed a data leak containing infrastructure details and work logs from employees of a state-affiliated private sector security firm in China.\nThe leaked data contains references to web content monitoring services used to enforce censorship for public and private sector customers.\nWork logs reveal that the firm provided bespoke monitoring services to a state-owned enterprise when a corruption scandal impacted this organization, providing insights into how the state and CCP coordinate with some cybersecurity companies to manage fallout from corruption scandals.\nOverview\nSentinelLABS has analyzed a data leak from TopSec (北京天融), a Chinese cybersecurity firm offering services such as Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) and vulnerability scanning, while offering boutique solutions to align with government initiatives and intelligence requirements.\nThe data leak includes a document with 7,000+ lines of work logs and code used to orchestrate infrastructure for the firm’s DevOps practices and downstream customers and includes scripts that connect to several Chinese government hostnames, academic institutions and news sites.\nWe identified work logs and system features that indicate TopSec is likely enabling content moderation for internet censorship purposes, a key strategy used by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to monitor and control public opinion on issues that the state deems contentious or antisocial.\nFurther, we found evidence indicating that TopSec provided bespoke services to a state-owned enterprise on the date that a corruption investigation was announced targeting the organization’s top official.\nThe Chinese cybersecurity market has long been a mystery for many researchers in the west. Unlike Europe and parts of the Middle East, which foster some degree of collaboration, the Chinese cybersecurity market is obscured behind the wall that divides China from the global internet. This finding reveals not only the types of technologies that are used by a prestigious Chinese tech firm, but how they are providing security services to private and public sector customers inside China.\nTopSec\nTopSec is a provider of monitoring and IT security solutions, as well as big data and cloud services. Established in 1995, TopSec prides itself on its long history and prioritizes national cyberspace security as a core element of its mission statement.\nCompany registration details reveal that TopSec holds over 1,000 patents, 87 software copyrights, and has 12 subsidiaries. The company is also a Tier 1 vulnerability supplier to China’s civilian intelligence ministry. According to TopSec’s 2024 annual corporate report for shareholders, the company has been offering cloud monitoring services–including IT security monitoring capabilities–since 2004. By 2020, these TopSec services were in use across all 31 of China’s administrative regions.\n\nDescription of TopSec services\n\nTopSec’s 2024 annual corporate report (Source)\nThe leaked documents we analyzed reference multiple organizations in both the private and public sectors, likely customers or otherwise associated with TopSec, a selection of which is listed below. These references include probable deployment sites of monitoring probes and mentions in-work progress records.\nPublic sector organizations referenced in the documents include entities integral to China’s political system, such as the Municipal Commissions for Discipline Inspection, which enforce party regulations and investigate corruption. Another example is the Illegal and Harmful Information Reporting Center, an entity dedicated to combating what the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) considers illegal and harmful behavior in the online space. TopSec customers referenced in these documents include:\nDongwu Fund Management Co., Ltd\nGucheng County Petition Bureau\nIllegal and Harmful Information Reporting Center\nLinhai Rural Commercial Bank\nPetkit\nShanghai Diepai Automobile Technology Co\nShanghai Fengyilong Electronic\nShanghai Medical Packaging Materials Factory\nShanghai Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection\nShanghai Municipal Supervisory Commission\nTibet Autonomous Region\nTibet Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China\nWuhu Discipline Inspection and Supervision Network\nWe observed references to three projects associated with Bureaus of the Ministry of Public Security in the northeastern city of Dandong, as well as the Songjiang and Pudong districts of Shanghai, with the latter project referred to as the “Cloud Monitoring Service Project”. The Ministry of Public Security is responsible for maintaining public order and overseeing law enforcement and surveillance activities to ensure compliance with national regulations.\n\r\n[2024-2025 Shanghai Public Security Bureau Pudong Branch Cloud Monitoring Service Project (Phase II)]\r\nThe statistics of events that occurred today are as follows:\r\nAggregated events: 883 Valid: 129 Invalid: 672 On-hand: 82\r\nSingle events: 5637 Valid: 187 Invalid: 2781 On-hand: 2669\r\nIn terms of event volume, it is basically the same as that of our competitors.\r\n\nA public procurement announcement for the “Cloud Monitoring Service Project” suggests that it involves monitoring the security posture and content of websites under the Bureaus’ jurisdiction, with alerts issued in case of security breaches or policy violations. TopSec was likely involved in the bidding process alongside competitor companies. Public documents, however, show TopSec did not win the contract.\nContract announcement  for Cloud Monitoring Service Project (Source)\nProcurement announcement for Cloud Monitoring Service Project (Source)\nInfrastructure Features\nWe identified this leak as a submission to a multi-scanner platform that fired off a rule that looks for common abuse activities associated with Kubernetes. The main file we analyzed (SHA-1: 1bccef07ad0348e326248fe321259e2bd8f8cf8b) contains numerous work logs, which are a description of the work performed by a TopSec employee and the amount of time the task took, often accompanied by scripts, commands, or data related to the task.\nExample of work logs from the file along with English translation\nIn addition to work logs, the leak contains many commands and playbooks used to administrate TopSec’s services via multiple common DevOps and infrastructure technologies that are used worldwide, including Ansible, Docker, ElasticSearch, Gitlab, Kafka, Kibana, Kubernetes, and Redis. There are many artifacts showing JSON data for web APIs used by TopSec services. There are also network configurations, SSH and port mapping commands with hardcoded credentials, which present a huge security risk should anyone obtain access to the environment–and would likely provide access to TopSec’s downstream customers as well.\nAnsible commands from leaked file used to access infrastructure\nThe leaked file is very large, disorganized, and the formatting is inconsistent, which complicates analysis. It is highly likely that we have not identified all capabilities outlined in the leak. Our analysis approach focused on translating the Chinese language content, identifying known technologies, and identifying interesting references in the commands and API JSON artifacts, particularly those where there were upticks in work logs performed around specific dates documented in the work logs or web API data.\nThe data leak includes a file that starts with infrastructure management code, including some which initializes several Docker images to enable security monitoring related features. These containers run probes, which are likely used for network monitoring. We are unable to fully assess the capabilities of these containers without access to them. However, the containers are run with several flags such as --privileged and --net host that suggest deep access to the monitored data. This may indicate the probes inspect network traffic or perform privileged tasks in the deployment environment.\nDeeper in the file, there are work logs which contain dates indicating when certain tasks were performed and notes from the TopSec staff who worked on specific infrastructure projects. One project referenced repeatedly is called Sparta or Sparda, with the spelling changing regularly. Notes from the TopSec staff indicate that Sparta handles sensitive word processing, an indication of censorship keyword monitoring.\nOn a technical level, Sparta is a framework that uses GraphQL APIs to receive content from downstream web applications. Work logs indicate that TopSec migrated from a system called Apollo, which is plausibly a reference to Apollo-GraphQL, an open-source framework offered by a company based in San Francisco. The work logs also indicate that Sparta is equipped to process Chinese language characters. This suggests that TopSec likely developed Sparta as an in-house solution that is tailored to the localized needs of TopSec’s customers and does not rely on a US-based solution.\nAdditionally, we observed a note indicating that detection alerts considered severe are likely distributed to internal teams via WeChat for prioritized handling. WeChat is a widely-used messaging and social media platform in China, known for its broad range of features, including messaging, social networking, and payment services. Its integration into daily life makes it an essential tool for communication and business operations within the country.\n\r\nSevere monitoring events are sent to corporate WeChat\r\n\nSince WeChat operates under Chinese regulations, there are significant implications regarding data privacy and government access. Under Chinese laws, such as the Cybersecurity Law, companies like Tencent, which owns WeChat, are required to cooperate with government entities, allowing them to access data when requested.\nWeb Content Monitoring\nOur analysis found that TopSec’s capabilities include web content monitoring, as indicated by references to a service called Website Monitoring Service and detection events with internal identifiers prefixed with Web, such as WebTamper, WebHiddenLink, WebAvailHttp, WebDns, WebTr, and WebSensitive.\nThis feature of the platform is likely part of what would have been proposed in response to the bid issued by the Shanghai Pudong Bureau for the “Cloud Monitoring Service Project”, offering the Bureau tools to monitor website security and content as part of their broader surveillance and compliance efforts.\n\r\nInspect website monitoring-related services\r\n[ . . . ]\r\n[2024-06-12T18:00:00 to 2024-06-12T22:00:00 Event volume: 553] 2024-06-12T18:00:00 to 2024-06-12T22:00:00 Event volume: 553\r\nWebSensitive 56\r\nWebTamper 149\r\nWebHiddenLink 348\r\n\nWhile the exact logic behind how the Web events are triggered remains unclear, the event names and metadata present in the documents provide insight into the purpose of some of these events. For instance, the WebAvailHttp event is likely triggered when a website is considered unavailable due to its response time (measured in milliseconds as respTimeMs in the figure below) exceeding a predefined threshold (respThresholdMs).\nMetadata on the WebAvailHttp event\nFurther, the WebHiddenLink event is likely triggered when web content contains hidden links — links that obscure their destination or mislead users, posing a security risk. Examples include links concealed within small or transparent elements, deceptive anchor text, and styling tricks that make links appear as plain text.\nThe WebHiddenLink event\nWeb Content Monitoring | Sensitive Words\nThe WebSensitive event is likely triggered when web content contains so-called sensitive words (敏感词 in Simplified Chinese). These words are related to political criticism, violence, or pornography, and are central to China’s domestic Internet censorship efforts aimed at ensuring compliance with government policies. Detecting the presence of such words in web content helps prevent the dissemination of information considered inappropriate or harmful by PRC authorities.\n\r\nAssist the product to check for missed scans and manual analysis and marking errors of sensitive word events\r\n\nTopSec’s ability to detect sensitive words demonstrates the impact that state policies related to the cyber domain have on the design and implementation of monitoring solutions developed by the private sector in China. These policies shape the strategies and technologies used to monitor, filter, and control online content, ensuring that IT systems comply with governmental regulations and censorship guidelines.\nWebSensitive alerts may be used by private sector organizations to monitor user-generated content on their websites in order to trigger actions such as issuing warnings, deleting content, or restricting access when sensitive words are detected. Government entities may also consume these alerts to track the presence of sensitive words on their own websites or across broader online spaces to enforce compliance with national censorship regulations. For example, the latter may have been an objective of the previously mentioned “Cloud Monitoring Service Project” by the Shanghai Pudong Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security.\nWe observed a task list indicating a focused effort to ensure consistent monitoring for sensitive words between 7:00 AM and 8:00 AM on the 14th (converted from GMT to China Standard Time), with the month and year not specified. The preceding document content suggests that the reference is to September 2023. One item in the task list instructs verification of the availability and capacity of sensitive word detection capabilities during this period, while another item records the forwarding of ‘asset identifiers’ for collected ‘validated events’ to an individual named Zhao Nannan (赵楠楠). The task list issuing this instruction very likely includes a typo stating the validated events were from 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM on September 14.\n\r\n1. \tPlan the probe deployment plan for the web split emergency milestone launch 3h\r\n2. \tCheck the number of agents for sensitive words between 23:00 on the 13th (GMT) and 14:00 at 00:00 (排查敏感词13日23点到14点0点之间的代办数量) 2h\r\n3. \tCheck cloud baseline 500 errors 1h\r\n4. \tCollect asset identifiers of valid events on the 13th and provide them to Zhao Nannan 1h\r\n5. \tCheck the task execution failure of ipv6 probe 1h\r\n\nDocument excerpts indicating sensitive web content actions in September 2023\nThe identification of an individual named Zhao Nannan as the likely recipient of this information, alongside the context of the monitoring effort, leads us to conclude with moderate confidence that this effort was in response to political events in Shanghai.\nWe identified a woman named Zhao Nannan as having worked at the 3rd Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security in Shanghai, which is responsible for network security and technical investigations. Our observations presented earlier in this post suggest close ties between Shanghai-based Bureaus of the Ministry of Public Security and TopSec, one example being TopSec’s participation in a project bidding process launched by the Shanghai Pudong Bureau.\n\nEmployment affiliation of Zhao Nannan (Source: LinkedIn)\nHowever, Zhao Nannan no longer works for the MPS 3rd Bureau in Shanghai. According to an online announcement from the Shanghai State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), Zhao Nannan was one of six successful applicants to SASAC for a network security role. The announcement even references her past role at the MPS 3rd Bureau.

The CCP has long-acknowledged that “If our party cannot traverse the hurdle represented by the Internet, it cannot traverse the hurdle of remaining in power for the long term.” This episode provides a compelling example of how corruption investigations expand to rely on the institutions of those being investigated and the cybersecurity companies that service them.\nConclusion\nThese leaks yield insight into the complex ecosystem of relationships between government entities and China’s private sector cybersecurity companies. While many countries have significant overlap between government requirements and private sector cybersecurity firms, the ties between these entities in China are much deeper and represent the state’s grasp on managing public opinion through online enforcement.\nThe September 2023 situation in Shanghai provides insight into how local and national government interests are enforced through private sector partnerships. The CCP’s strategy of controlling information is multifaceted and requires significant investment in resources that enable the monitoring and alteration of content that citizens engage with. While there are still many unknown factors regarding how such censorship is applied, these findings yield insights into how collaboration occurs between the government and other entities in China.\nThe nature of how this data was leaked remains unclear, but the materials show that TopSec engineers were documenting their work in a highly granular way that included entire commands used to perform the outlined tasks. Considering the types of information in this leak, organizations should evaluate how their systems and infrastructure engineers are logging work. Proper credential management is essential to securing sensitive environments. Infrastructure engineers should rely on a secrets manager that integrates with the CI/CD pipeline rather than running commands from playbooks that include hardcoded credentials. This results in only variable names being stored in commands instead of sensitive credentials and lowers the likelihood that an unexpected disclosure could result in further compromise.","enclosure":{"url":"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CasS-Leaks-ftr.jpg","length":"604370","type":"image/jpeg"},"dc:creator":"Alex Delamotte, Aleksandar Milenkoski &amp; Dakota Cary","content":"Data leak reveals how a top tier cybersecurity vendor helps the PRC enforce content monitoring and manipulation of public opinion in China.","contentSnippet":"Data leak reveals how a top tier cybersecurity vendor helps the PRC enforce content monitoring and manipulation of public opinion in China.","guid":"https://www.sentinelone.com/?post_type=labs&p=114581","categories":["China"],"isoDate":"2025-02-21T10:55:35.000Z","tag":"intel"},{"creator":"Tom Hegel, Jim Walter &amp; Alex Delamotte","title":"X Phishing | Campaign Targeting High Profile Accounts Returns, Promoting Crypto Scams","link":"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/phishing-on-x-high-profile-account-targeting-campaign-returns/","pubDate":"Fri, 31 Jan 2025 14:55:46 +0000","content:encoded":"<h2>Executive Summary</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>An active phishing campaign is targeting high-profile X accounts in an attempt to hijack and exploit them for fraudulent activity.</li>\n<li>This campaign has been observed targeting a variety of individual and organization accounts such as U.S. political figures, leading international journalists, an X employee, large technology organizations, cryptocurrency organizations, and owners of valuable, short usernames.</li>\n<li>SentinelLABS’ analysis links this activity to a similar operation from last year that successfully compromised multiple accounts to spread scam content with financial objectives.

One example is the classic account login notice. The links in the email received by the target are not legitimate and lead to credential phishing sites. Other observed lures use copyright violation themes. However, SentinelLABS notes that directly phishing users may not be the only access method employed by this attacker.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_113633\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-113633\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-113633 size-full\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/new-login-phishing-email.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"760\" height=\"1320\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/new-login-phishing-email.jpg 760w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/new-login-phishing-email-173x300.jpg 173w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/new-login-phishing-email-590x1024.jpg 590w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-113633\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">An X ‘new login’-themed phishing email</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In recent cases, we observed the actor abusing Google&#8217;s &#8220;AMP Cache&#8221; domain <code>cdn.ampproject[.]org</code> to evade email detections and redirect the user to a phishing domain:</p>\n<pre>https://cdn.ampproject[.]org/c/s/x-recoverysupport.com/reset/?username=[X-USERNAME]</pre>\n<p>This ultimately leads the targets to an actor-made phishing website seeking X account credentials:</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_113632\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-113632\" style=\"width: 684px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-113632 size-full\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/x-creds-phishing-page.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"684\" height=\"792\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/x-creds-phishing-page.jpg 684w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/x-creds-phishing-page-259x300.jpg 259w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 684px) 100vw, 684px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-113632\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">X credential phishing page</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In the copyright infringement lure scenario, the user will first visit an Action Needed page before being prompted to enter credentials:</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_113631\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-113631\" style=\"width: 1514px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-113631\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/x-fake-copyright-infringement.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1514\" height=\"786\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/x-fake-copyright-infringement.jpg 1514w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/x-fake-copyright-infringement-300x156.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/x-fake-copyright-infringement-1024x532.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/x-fake-copyright-infringement-768x399.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1514px) 100vw, 1514px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-113631\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">X fake copyright infringement page</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Once an account is taken over, the attacker swiftly locks out the legitimate owner and begins posting fraudulent cryptocurrency opportunities or links to external sites designed to lure additional targets, often with a crypto theft-related theme.

Our observations indicate a level of informality and flexibility of infrastructure use – meaning any of these domains can be considered email delivery or phishing page hosting.</p>\n<p>An overall collection of recent activity can be observed hosted on <code>84.38.130[.]20</code>, an IP associated with a Belize-based VPS service called Dataclub. The domains themselves have been predominantly registered through Turkish hosting provider Turkticaret.</p>\n<p>Inspecting the DNS history of <code>84.38.130[.]20</code> leads to a variety of interestingly related domains. As shown below, the cluster of activity began in mid-2024 and continues today. While this is only one phishing page hosting IP, it provides a good perspective of the length of this activity and its ability to avoid much attention for over a year.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_113630\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-113630\" style=\"width: 1558px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-113630\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/validin-infrastructure-analysis.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1558\" height=\"886\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/validin-infrastructure-analysis.jpg 1558w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/validin-infrastructure-analysis-300x171.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/validin-infrastructure-analysis-1024x582.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/validin-infrastructure-analysis-768x437.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/validin-infrastructure-analysis-1536x873.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1558px) 100vw, 1558px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-113630\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Validin Infrastructure Analysis Timeline</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Our observations suggest that the attacker is highly adaptable, continuously exploring new techniques while maintaining a clear financial motive.

While marketing for coins and tokens has long been irreverent and meme-driven, recent developments have further blurred the line between legitimate projects and scams. </p>\n<p>A striking example occurred in January 2025, when the X account of the late crypto-enthusiast and antivirus founder John McAfee was reactivated to promote a new coin, <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/john-mcafee-reborn-as-ai-memecoin-and-chatbot-with-27-million-market-cap/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$AIntivirus</a>. The marketing style and brand voice of this purportedly legitimate token closely resemble tactics used in known scam campaigns, highlighting how easily crypto enthusiasts can be misled in an already murky ecosystem.</p>\n<p>To safeguard your X account, we strongly recommend using a unique password, enabling two-factor authentication (2FA), and avoiding credential sharing with third-party services.

While the activity detailed here is centered around X/Twitter accounts, this actor is not limited to a single social platform, and can be observed directing attention to other popular services as well, while seemingly pursuing the same financial objectives.\nIf you’ve encountered similar suspicious activity, SentinelLABS would love to hear from you — please reach out to the team at ThreatTips@sentinelone.com.\nAccount Compromise Process\nThanks to tips from targets and collaboration with industry partners, SentinelLABS has observed a variety of phishing lures tied to this campaign over the past few weeks. One example is the classic account login notice. The links in the email received by the target are not legitimate and lead to credential phishing sites. Other observed lures use copyright violation themes. However, SentinelLABS notes that directly phishing users may not be the only access method employed by this attacker.\nAn X ‘new login’-themed phishing email\nIn recent cases, we observed the actor abusing Google’s “AMP Cache” domain cdn.ampproject[.]org to evade email detections and redirect the user to a phishing domain:\nhttps://cdn.ampproject[.]org/c/s/x-recoverysupport.com/reset/?username=[X-USERNAME]\nThis ultimately leads the targets to an actor-made phishing website seeking X account credentials:\nX credential phishing page\nIn the copyright infringement lure scenario, the user will first visit an Action Needed page before being prompted to enter credentials:\nX fake copyright infringement page\nOnce an account is taken over, the attacker swiftly locks out the legitimate owner and begins posting fraudulent cryptocurrency opportunities or links to external sites designed to lure additional targets, often with a crypto theft-related theme. Ultimately, compromising high-profile accounts enables the attacker to reach a broader audience of potential secondary victims, maximizing their financial gains.\nWidespread Activity\nIn recent activity associated with this campaign, the domain securelogins-x[.]com has been used to deliver emails and x-recoverysupport[.]com to host phishing pages. Our observations indicate a level of informality and flexibility of infrastructure use – meaning any of these domains can be considered email delivery or phishing page hosting.\nAn overall collection of recent activity can be observed hosted on 84.38.130[.]20, an IP associated with a Belize-based VPS service called Dataclub. The domains themselves have been predominantly registered through Turkish hosting provider Turkticaret.\nInspecting the DNS history of 84.38.130[.]20 leads to a variety of interestingly related domains. As shown below, the cluster of activity began in mid-2024 and continues today. While this is only one phishing page hosting IP, it provides a good perspective of the length of this activity and its ability to avoid much attention for over a year.\nValidin Infrastructure Analysis Timeline\nOur observations suggest that the attacker is highly adaptable, continuously exploring new techniques while maintaining a clear financial motive. The targeting appears constrained, yet opportunistic. Notably, past public reports have attributed related activity to Turkish-speaking actors based on language phishing page source comment language. At this time, we do not attribute this campaign to a specific country or any widely-tracked threat actor.\nSome of the malicious sites and content hosted across 84.38.130[.]20 are built using the FASTPANEL DIRECT service.\nFASTPANEL landing page on buy-tanai[.]com\nFASTPANEL is a website hosting and building service that specializes in rapid building and management of websites. While FASTPANEL is not a malicious service, it is frequently abused by bad actors due to the ease of use, rapid scalability, and relatively low cost. FASTPANEL is routinely utilized by drainer gains and phishing campaigns, and is also included in associated guides and tutorials distributed throughout cybercrime communication channels.\nExample discussion of FASTPANEL (RU crime forum)\nOf the sites hosted on 84.38.130[.]20, the buy-tanai[.]com and emotionai[.]live sites still present the FASTPANEL landing pages as of this writing.\nPublicly Linkable Activity\nEmerging Account Intrusions\nWhile we have not yet established a high-confidence link, a recent compromise of a Tor Project account closely mirrors our observations. On January 30, 2025, the official X account for the Tor Project was breached. While it is possible that the same threat actor is responsible, we lack sufficient evidence to confirm the connection as of this writing.\nX post from The Tor Project account on January 30, 2025 advising users of a potential compromise\nTor Project account compromise notice\nThe Decentralized Autonomous Wireless Network (DAWN) was another victim of this type of attack. The threat actor leveraged the compromised DAWN-related social media accounts to lure victims into entering credentials into phishing pages targeting X and Telegram credentials.\nDAWN X Posts\nThe compromise of DAWN’s X accounts goes back to mid-January 2025.\nJanuary 14, 2025 – DAWN rewards compromise post\nCrypto-Themed Project Placeholders\nIn some cases, we’ve observed cryptocurrency themed projects seemingly acting as placeholders for future use, or direct pump-and-dump schemes. In one example, buy-tanai[.]com was pitched as such: “$TANA AI. Dawn’s AI project, Tana is the first AI-powered LP and trading agent, now live on the Solana blockchain.”\nTana AI (TANA) on Pump[.]fun\nThe domainbuy-tanai[.]com currently displays default FASTPANEL landing pages, suggesting it — along with other similar domains — is being staged for future attacks. Since FASTPANEL-managed sites can be rapidly updated, these domains serve as adaptable templates for phishing campaigns.\nNotably, TANA AI (TANA) was launched by Dawn in mid-January to promote AI-driven trading and liquidity provision in the cryptocurrency market. Despite losing most of its initial value within days, the currency remains actively traded across multiple decentralized exchanges.\nGiven the crypto-related nature of these domains, it is likely that threat actors are using them as flexible phishing infrastructure. By keeping them as blank templates, they can quickly modify hosted content to align with ongoing campaigns as needed.\nCrimeware Relations\nSeveral other domains share overlaps in both use and unique infrastructure details, yet they represent a fork from the previously described high-profile social media profile attacks, including:\ndataoptimix[.]com\ngamecodestudios[.]com\nshortwayscooter[.]com\nThe domain shortwayscooter[.]com hosts fake captchas that deliver the DanaBot banking trojan. DataOptimix is branded as a generative AI solution, though there are few details about what the service does.\nDataOptimix\nHistorical Connections\nIn mid-2024, a campaign used related infrastructure in similar phishing messages, including those which compromised the Linus Tech Tips Twitter account along with several other high profile users. At the time, @LinusTech had roughly 1.8million followers, which may represent the highest profile account successfully hijacked and linked to this actor.\nLinus Tech Tips Twitter compromise\nConclusion\nThe cryptocurrency landscape offers financially-motivated threat actors multiple opportunities for profit and fraud. While marketing for coins and tokens has long been irreverent and meme-driven, recent developments have further blurred the line between legitimate projects and scams. \nA striking example occurred in January 2025, when the X account of the late crypto-enthusiast and antivirus founder John McAfee was reactivated to promote a new coin, $AIntivirus. The marketing style and brand voice of this purportedly legitimate token closely resemble tactics used in known scam campaigns, highlighting how easily crypto enthusiasts can be misled in an already murky ecosystem.\nTo safeguard your X account, we strongly recommend using a unique password, enabling two-factor authentication (2FA), and avoiding credential sharing with third-party services. Be especially cautious of messages containing links to account alerts or security notices. Always verify URLs before clicking, and if a password reset is needed, initiate it directly through the official website or app rather than relying on unsolicited links.\nIf you’ve encountered similar suspicious activity, we’d love to hear from you.

Operation Digital Eye marks the first instance of a suspected Chinese APT group using this technique that we have directly observed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Tinexta Cyber and SentinelLabs have been tracking threat activities targeting business-to-business IT service providers in Southern Europe. Based on the malware, infrastructure, techniques used, victimology, and the timing of the activities, we assess that it is highly likely these attacks were conducted by a China-nexus threat actor with cyberespionage motivations.</p>\n<p>The relationships between European countries and China are complex, characterized by cooperation, competition, and underlying tensions in areas such as trade, investment, and technology. Suspected China-linked cyberespionage groups <a href=\"https://cert.europa.eu/static/files/TLP-CLEAR-JointPublication-23-01.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">frequently</a> <a href=\"https://cert.europa.eu/publications/threat-intelligence/cb24-08/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">target</a> public and private organizations across Europe to gather strategic intelligence, gain competitive advantages, and advance geopolitical, economic, and technological interests.</p>\n<p>The attack campaign, which we have dubbed Operation Digital Eye, took place from late June to mid-July 2024, lasting approximately three weeks. The targeted organizations provide solutions for managing data, infrastructure, and cybersecurity for clients across various industries, making them prime targets for cyberespionage actors.</p>\n<p>A sustained presence within these organizations would provide the Operation Digital Eye actors with a strategic foothold, creating opportunities for intrusions across the digital supply chain and enabling them to exert control over critical IT processes within the downstream compromised entities. The attacks were detected and disrupted during their initial phases.</p>\n<p>The exact group behind Operation Digital Eye remains unclear due to the extensive <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/chinese-entanglement-dll-hijacking-in-the-asian-gambling-sector/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sharing</a> of malware, operational playbooks, and infrastructure management processes within the Chinese threat landscape. The threat actors used a pass-the-hash capability, likely originating from the same source as closed-source custom Mimikatz modifications observed exclusively in suspected Chinese cyberespionage activities, such as <a href=\"https://www.cybereason.com/blog/research/operation-soft-cell-a-worldwide-campaign-against-telecommunications-providers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Operation Soft Cell</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/operation-tainted-love-chinese-apts-target-telcos-in-new-attacks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Operation Tainted Love</a>. The malware and tooling used in these campaigns have been <a href=\"https://github.com/yt0ng/cracking_softcell/blob/main/Cracking_SOFTCLL_TLP_WHITE.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">linked </a>to several distinct Chinese APT groups. We collectively refer to these custom Mimikatz modifications as mimCN.</p>\n<p>The long-term evolution and versioning of mimCN samples, along with notable features such as instructions left for a separate team of operators, suggest the involvement of a shared vendor or digital quartermaster responsible for the active maintenance and provisioning of tooling. This function within the Chinese APT ecosystem, corroborated by the <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/unmasking-i-soon-the-leak-that-revealed-chinas-cyber-operations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I-Soon leak</a>, likely plays a key role in facilitating China-nexus cyberespionage operations.</p>\n<p>The abuse of <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Visual Studio Code</a> <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Remote Tunnels</a> for C2 purposes is central to this campaign. Originally designed to enable remote development, this technology provides full endpoint access, including command execution and filesystem manipulation. Additionally, Visual Studio Code tunneling involves executables signed by Microsoft and Microsoft Azure network infrastructure, both of which are often not closely monitored and are typically allowed by application controls and firewall rules. As a result, this technique may be challenging to detect and could evade security defenses. Combined with the full endpoint access it provides, this makes Visual Studio Code tunneling an attractive and powerful capability for threat actors to exploit.</p>\n<p>Tinexta Cyber and SentinelLabs have notified Microsoft about the abuse of Visual Studio Code and Azure infrastructure in connection with Operation Digital Eye.</p>\n<h2>Infection Vector and Attack Progression</h2>\n<p>The attackers used SQL (Structured Query Language) injection as an initial access vector to infiltrate Internet-facing web and database servers. <code>User-Agent</code> request headers in the web traffic logs we retrieved indicate that the attackers used the <a href=\"https://sqlmap.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sqlmap</a> tool to automate the detection and exploitation of SQL injection vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>To establish an initial foothold and maintain persistent access, the threat actors deployed a PHP-based webshell. Relatively simple in design and implementation, the webshell uses the <a href=\"https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.assert.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">assert</a> function to execute attacker-provided PHP code. Its implementation does not resemble any other webshells we are familiar with. We track this webshell under the name PHPsert.</p>\n<p>To disguise the files implementing PHPsert and attempt to evade detection based on filesystem activity, the attackers used custom names tailored to the infiltrated environments, making the filenames appear legitimate. This included using the local language and terms that aligned with the technological context of the targeted organizations.</p>\n<p>After establishing an initial foothold, the threat actors conducted reconnaissance using a variety of third-party tools and built-in Windows utilities, such as <a href=\"https://joeware.net/freetools/tools/getuserinfo/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GetUserInfo</a> and <code>ping</code>. They also deployed the <code>local.exe</code> tool, which is part of the Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit and allows for viewing user group memberships.</p>\n<p>To steal credentials, the attackers used the <code>CreateDump</code> tool to <a href=\"https://lolbas-project.github.io/lolbas/OtherMSBinaries/Createdump/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">extract</a> memory allocated to the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process and exfiltrate credentials. <code>CreateDump</code> is part of the Microsoft .NET Framework distribution. The threat actors also retrieved credentials from the Security Account Manager (SAM) database, which they extracted from the Windows Registry using the <code>reg save</code> <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/reg-save\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">command</a>.</p>\n<p>The threat actors frequently named the files they deployed using the pattern <code>do.*</code>. Examples include <code>do.log</code> (output from <code>ping</code> commands), <code>do.exe</code> (the <code>CreateDump</code> tool), and <code>do.bat</code> (a script that executes and deletes the <code>CreateDump</code> executable).</p>\n<p>From the initially compromised endpoints, the attackers moved laterally across the internal network, primarily using RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) connections and pass-the-hash techniques. For the pass-the-hash attacks, they used a custom modified version of Mimikatz, implemented in an executable named <code>bK2o.exe</code>.</p>\n<p>In addition to the PHPsert webshell, the threat actors used two methods for remote command execution: SSH access, enabled by deploying <code>authorized_keys</code> files containing public keys for authentication, and Visual Studio Code Remote Tunnels.</p>\n<p>Visual Studio Code Remote Tunnels, based on Microsoft’s <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dev tunnel</a> technology, enable developers to access and work on remote systems. This access includes the command terminal and file system, allowing activities such as command execution and file editing. The Operation Digital Eye actors abused this functionality to maintain persistent backdoor access to compromised systems.</p>\n<p>In an attempt to evade detection based on filesystem activity, the threat actors used <code>%SystemRoot%\\Temp</code> and <code>%ProgramData%\\Visual Studio Code</code> as their primary working directories for storing tools and data. <code>%SystemRoot%\\Temp</code> is a directory where Windows stores temporary files and is often monitored with less scrutiny. <code>%ProgramData%\\Visual Studio Code</code> was intended to appear as a legitimate directory associated with Visual Studio Code.</p>\n<p>The intrusions were detected and interrupted before the attackers could proceed to further phases, such as exfiltrating data.</p>\n<h2>Abuse of Visual Studio Code</h2>\n<p>The threat actors deployed a portable Visual Studio Code executable named <code>code.exe</code>, which is digitally signed by Microsoft, and used the <a href=\"https://github.com/winsw/winsw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">winsw</a> tool to run it as a Windows service. The <code>winsw</code> configuration file we retrieved indicates that the attackers created a service named <code>Visual Studio Code Service</code>, which executes <code>code.exe</code> with the <code>tunnel</code> command-line parameter at every system startup.</p>\n<p>The configuration file reveals a pragmatic approach by the threat actors, who likely modified a <a href=\"https://github.com/winsw/winsw/blob/v3/samples/complete.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">publicly available</a> <code>winsw</code> configuration. This is suggested by the use of the <code>myapp</code> service identifier and the <code>%BASE%\\logs</code> directory for storing <code>winsw</code> log files, both of which appear in the public configuration file as well as in the one we retrieved.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_109546\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-109546\" style=\"width: 852px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye13.jpg\" alt=\"winsw configuration file\" width=\"852\" height=\"396\" class=\"size-full wp-image-109546\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye13.jpg 852w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye13-300x139.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye13-768x357.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 852px) 100vw, 852px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-109546\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">winsw configuration file</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The <code>tunnel</code> parameter instructs Visual Studio Code to create a dev tunnel and act as a server to which remote users can connect. After <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/security\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">authenticating</a> to the tunnel with a Microsoft or GitHub account, remote users can access the endpoint running the Visual Studio Code server, either through the Visual Studio Code desktop application or the browser-based version, <a href=\"https://vscode.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">vscode.dev</a>.</p>\n<p>After creating the dev tunnels, the threat actors authenticated using GitHub accounts and accessed the compromised endpoints through the browser-based version of Visual Studio Code. We have no knowledge of whether the threat actors used self-registered or compromised GitHub accounts to authenticate to the tunnels.</p>\n<h2>Network Infrastructure</h2>\n<p>The Operation Digital Eye actors used infrastructure located exclusively within Europe, sourced from the provider M247 and the Cloud platform Microsoft Azure. This was likely part of a deliberate strategy. Since the targeted organizations are based and operate within Europe, the attackers may have aimed to minimize suspicion by aligning their infrastructure&#8217;s location with that of their targets. Additionally, Cloud infrastructure commonly used in legitimate IT workflows, such as Microsoft Azure, is often not closely monitored and is frequently allowed through firewall restrictions. By leveraging public Cloud infrastructure for malicious purposes, the attackers made the traffic appear legitimate, which can be challenging to detect and may evade security defenses.</p>\n<p>In the initial phases of the attacks, the threat actors used the server with IP address <code>146.70.161[.]78</code> to establish initial access by detecting and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities, and the server with IP address <code>185.76.78[.]117</code> to operate the PHPsert webshell. Both IP addresses are allocated to the infrastructure provider M247 and are located in Poland and Italy, respectively.</p>\n<p>In the later phases of the attacks, the threat actors used the server with IP address <code>4.232.170[.]137</code> for C2 purposes when remotely accessing compromised endpoints via the SSH protocol. This server is part of Microsoft&#8217;s Azure infrastructure in the <code>Italy North</code> <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/regions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">datacenter region</a> (<a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56519\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Azure IP range</a>: <code>4.232.128[.]0/18</code>, <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/service-tags-overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">service tag</a>: <code>AzureCloud.italynorth</code>). We currently have no information on whether the threat actors used self-registered or compromised Azure credentials to access and manage the Azure resources and services.</p>\n<p>The abuse of Visual Studio Code tunneling for C2 purposes also relies on Microsoft Azure infrastructure. Creating and hosting a dev tunnel requires connecting to a Microsoft Azure server with a domain of <code>*.[clusterID].devtunnels.ms</code>, where <code>[clusterID]</code> corresponds to the Azure region of the endpoint running the Visual Studio Code server, <a href=\"https://global.rel.tunnels.api.visualstudio.com/api/v1/clusters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">such as</a> <code>euw</code> for <code>West Europe</code>. In Operation Digital Eye, the creation of dev tunnels involved establishing connections to the server with the domain <code>[REDACTED].euw.devtunnels[.]ms</code>, which resolved to the IP address <code>20.103.221[.]187</code>. This server is part of Microsoft&#8217;s Azure infrastructure in the <code>West Europe</code> datacenter region (Azure IP range: <code>20.103.0[.]0/16</code>, service tag: <code>AzureCloud.westeurope</code>).</p>\n<h2>The PHPsert Webshell</h2>\n<p>PHPsert executes attacker-provided PHP code using the <a href=\"https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.assert.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">assert</a> function, which, in PHP versions prior to 8.0.0, interprets and runs parameter strings as PHP code. To hinder static analysis and evade detection, the webshell uses various code obfuscation techniques, including XOR encoding, hexadecimal character representation, string concatenation, and randomized variable names.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_109540\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-109540\" style=\"width: 664px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye3.jpg\" alt=\"PHPsert implementation\" width=\"664\" height=\"434\" class=\"size-full wp-image-109540\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye3.jpg 664w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye3-300x196.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 664px) 100vw, 664px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-109540\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">PHPsert implementation</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The PHPsert webshell operates as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">PHPsert instantiates a class with a single regular method, which XOR-decodes and concatenates hexadecimal characters to generate the string <code>assert</code>. The class&#8217;s destructor (the magic method <code>__destruct</code>) uses this string to invoke the <code>assert</code> function, passing attacker-provided PHP code as a parameter.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The webshell retrieves the attacker-provided PHP code from an HTTP POST request parameter, for example, <code>momomomo</code>. If the <code>id</code> parameter is present in the request URL, PHPsert decodes the Base64-encoded value of the POST parameter. If the <code>id</code> parameter is absent, the webshell uses the raw value of the parameter.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Finally, when PHPsert finishes executing, the class&#8217;s destructor is invoked, which in turn calls the <code>assert</code> function to execute the attacker-provided PHP code.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We identified multiple PHPsert variants, which have been submitted to malware sharing platforms since May 2023, from various locations including Japan, Singapore, Peru, Taiwan, Iran, Korea, and the Philippines. These variants show only minor differences in their implementation, such as varying variable names and POST request parameters like <code>mr6</code>, <code>brute</code>, and <code>qq</code>. Our analysis suggests that PHPsert is deployed not only as a standalone PHP file but is also integrated into various types of web content, including web text editors and content management systems.</p>\n<p>One of the PHPsert variants contains commented-out code snippets and comments in simplified Chinese that describe nearby code. These comments and snippets are not present in the PHPsert versions observed in Operation Digital Eye, nor in any of the webshell’s other variants. Below are the code comments, all of which are machine-translated from simplified Chinese:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><code>结果是\"assert\"</code>, which translates to <code>The result is \"assert\"</code>.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><code>验证 $this->rg 是否安全</code>, which translates to <code>Verify that $this->rg is safe</code>.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><code>验证和清理用户输入</code>, which translates to <code>Validating and sanitizing user input</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye14.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"382\" height=\"196\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-109545\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye14.jpg 382w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye14-300x154.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 382px) 100vw, 382px\" /><br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"580\" height=\"119\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-109541\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye2.jpg 580w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye2-300x62.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px\" /><br />\n<figure id=\"attachment_109548\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-109548\" style=\"width: 671px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye11.jpg\" alt=\"PHPsert code snippets with comments in Chinese\" width=\"671\" height=\"45\" class=\"size-full wp-image-109548\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye11.jpg 671w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye11-300x20.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 671px) 100vw, 671px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-109548\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">PHPsert code snippets with comments in Chinese</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>The presence of these comments, along with the indicators of removed code across PHPsert variants, suggests the potential involvement of Chinese-speaking developers who may have been simplifying the webshell&#8217;s execution logic.</p>\n<h2>Pass-the-Hash Capability</h2>\n<p>The <code>bK2o.exe</code> executable (a custom modified version of Mimikatz used in Operation Digital Eye for pass-the-hash attacks) enables the execution of processes within a user&#8217;s security context by leveraging a compromised NTLM password hash, bypassing the need for the user’s actual password. To achieve this, <code>bK2o.exe</code> overwrites memory of the LSASS process. The tool supports the following command-line parameters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><code>/c</code>: The process to execute; defaults to <code>cmd.exe</code> if not provided.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><code>/u</code>: The user’s username.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><code>/d</code>: The user’s domain.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><code>/h</code>: The NTLM password hash.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>bK2o.exe</code> implements a pass-the-hash technique by overwriting LSASS memory in a manner similar to Mimikatz, with its implementation partially overlapping with Mimikatz functions such as <code>kuhl_m_sekurlsa_pth_luid</code> and <code>kuhl_m_sekurlsa_msv_enum_cred_callback_pth</code>. In summary, <code>bK2o.exe</code> performs the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-createprocesswithlogonw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Creates</a> a suspended process in a new logon session, specifying the attacker-provided process, username, domain, and an empty password.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Based on the session’s locally unique identifier (LUID), locates and extracts from the LSASS process memory an encrypted credential data blob containing the user’s NTLM hash and the encryption keys required to decrypt the blob.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Decrypts the data blob, overwrites the user’s NTLM hash with the attacker-provided hash, and re-encrypts the data blob.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Resumes the suspended process.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure id=\"attachment_109535\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-109535\" style=\"width: 749px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye8.jpg\" alt=\"bK2o.exe creates a new process and retrieves the logon session’s LUID\" width=\"749\" height=\"527\" class=\"size-full wp-image-109535\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye8.jpg 749w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye8-300x211.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-109535\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">bK2o.exe creates a new process and retrieves the logon session’s LUID</figcaption></figure>\n<p>To navigate LSASS memory, <code>bK2o.exe</code> uses code signatures, represented as byte sequences in hexadecimal format.

Combined with the presence of overlapping mimCN samples across various intrusions attributed to China-nexus APT groups and distributed over years, this suggests that mimCN is likely the product of an entity responsible for maintaining and provisioning tools to multiple clusters within the Chinese APT ecosystem.</p>\n<h2>Attribution Analysis</h2>\n<p>We assess that Operation Digital Eye was highly likely conducted by a China-nexus cluster with cyberespionage motivations. The specific group responsible remains unclear due to the extensive sharing of malware, operational playbooks, and infrastructure management processes among Chinese APT clusters. Our assessment is based on a collective consideration of multiple indicators, including the malware, infrastructure, and techniques used, victimology, and the timing of the activities.</p>\n<h3>Malware</h3>\n<p>A variant of the PHPsert webshell contains code comments in simplified Chinese. This suggests the potential involvement of Chinese-speaking developers. Further, the custom Mimikatz modification <code>bK2o.exe</code> used in Operation Digital Eye is part of the mimCN collection and shares implementation overlaps with other custom Mimikatz modifications, suggesting a common origin. These tools have been observed exclusively in the context of suspected Chinese APT activities, such as <a href=\"https://www.cybereason.com/blog/research/operation-soft-cell-a-worldwide-campaign-against-telecommunications-providers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Operation Soft Cell</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/operation-tainted-love-chinese-apts-target-telcos-in-new-attacks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Operation Tainted Love</a>. Malware and tooling used in these operations have been associated with the suspected Chinese APT groups Granite Typhoon and APT41, and <a href=\"https://github.com/yt0ng/cracking_softcell/blob/main/Cracking_SOFTCLL_TLP_WHITE.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">possible connections</a> to other China-nexus groups, such as APT10 and Lucky Mouse have also been suggested.</p>\n<p>The mimCN tool collection suggests the presence of a shared vendor or digital quartermaster responsible for the sustained development and provisioning of tools to groups within the Chinese APT ecosystem. This function is <a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2023-1107.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">suspected</a> to play a significant role in the Chinese threat landscape. The <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/unmasking-i-soon-the-leak-that-revealed-chinas-cyber-operations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">I-Soon leak</a>, which offers rare insight into China’s cyberespionage activities, provides supporting evidence for the existence of digital quartermasters within this landscape.</p>\n<h3>Infrastructure</h3>\n<p>While not exclusive to Chinese APT groups, the use of M247 infrastructure, as seen in Operation Digital Eye, has been common among them in recent years. One example is the <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/sandman-apt-china-based-adversaries-embrace-lua/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">M247 infrastructure attributed</a> to the suspected Chinese cluster STORM-0866 (also known as Red Dev 40), with which the <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/sandman-apt-a-mystery-group-targeting-telcos-with-a-luajit-toolkit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sandman APT group</a> is associated.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the use of Cloud services and resources located in geographic proximity to the targeted organizations in Operation Digital Eye suggests a carefully planned and targeted infrastructure management approach. In this context, we suspect the potential involvement of third-party entities tasked with administering and provisioning infrastructure, a practice that has become <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/china-nexus-espionage-orb-networks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">increasingly common</a> in the Chinese APT ecosystem in recent years.</p>\n<h3>Abuse of Visual Studio Code</h3>\n<p>Our visibility into threat actor activities suggests that the abuse of Visual Studio Code tunneling for C2 purposes was relatively rare in the wild before Operation Digital Eye.</p>\n<p>Previous <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/security/crowdstrike-2024-report-exposes-north-koreas-covert-workforce-in-u-s-tech-firms/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">research</a> indicates that, starting in 2023, a suspected North Korean group has used Visual Studio Remote Tunnels to maintain persistence in compromised networks. Additionally, in October 2024, Cyble released a <a href=\"https://cyble.com/blog/silent-intrusion-unraveling-the-sophisticated-attack-leveraging-vs-code-for-unauthorized-access/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">report</a> documenting unattributed activity in which threat actors distributed a <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/who-needs-macros-threat-actors-pivot-to-abusing-explorer-and-other-lolbins-via-windows-shortcuts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Windows Shortcut</a> (LNK) file to deploy Visual Studio Code and activate its tunneling feature to establish remote access.</p>\n<p>As of this writing, the only publicly disclosed use of this technique around the time of Operation Digital Eye has been attributed to a suspected Chinese APT group. In September 2024, Unit 42 published a <a href=\"https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/stately-taurus-abuses-vscode-southeast-asian-espionage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">report</a> on a campaign targeting government entities in Southeast Asia, in which threat actors used Visual Studio Code as a backdoor. The campaign was attributed to Stately Taurus (also known as Mustang Panda). The exact timeline of the campaign is unclear, with mid-August 2024 being the only reference point explicitly mentioned in the Unit 42 report. Based on this, we suspect that Operation Digital Eye occurred prior to this activity.</p>\n<p>We did not observe any overlaps in TTPs between Operation Digital Eye and the activity reported by Unit 42, except for the abuse of Visual Studio Code. We recognize the possibility that distinct Chinese APT clusters may share operational playbooks that include leveraging Visual Studio Code for C2 purposes.</p>\n<h3>Temporal Analysis</h3>\n<p>Our analysis of timestamps marking the dates and times of operator activity in the targeted organizations showed that all activities occurred on workdays (Monday to Friday). Additionally, converting the timestamps from their original time zones, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and Central European Summer Time (CEST, UTC+2), to China Standard Time (CST, UTC+8) revealed that the operators were primarily active during typical working hours in China, mostly between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. CST.</p>\n<p>This suggests a potentially state-sanctioned operation. The &#8216;996&#8217; work schedule (9 a.m. to 9 p.m. CST, six days a week) has been common in China’s technology sector, but it was <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinese-authorities-say-overtime-996-policy-is-illegal-2021-08-27/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ruled illegal</a> by the Supreme People&#8217;s Court in 2021. As a result, state employees are almost certainly restricted to weekday work, typically between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m., aligning closely with our observations from the timestamp analysis.</p>\n<p>The figure below shows the total number of connections established by the threat actors to Visual Studio Code tunnels throughout Operation Digital Eye, broken down by hour of the day. The data is presented in both the original time zone (CEST) and in China Standard Time (CST, CEST+6). We observed minimal to no activity between 10 p.m. and 9 a.m. CST, as well as between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. CST, which aligns with the typical daily working hours in China, including the midday lunch break.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_109536\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-109536\" style=\"width: 1999px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye7.jpg\" alt=\"Number of established connections to Visual Studio Code tunnels\" width=\"1999\" height=\"704\" class=\"size-full wp-image-109536\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye7.jpg 1999w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye7-300x106.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye7-1024x361.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye7-768x270.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye7-1536x541.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-109536\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Number of established connections to Visual Studio Code tunnels</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Conclusions</h2>\n<p>Operation Digital Eye highlights the persistent threat posed by Chinese cyberespionage groups to European entities, with these threat actors continuing to focus on high-value targets. The campaign underscores the strategic nature of this threat, as breaching organizations that provide data, infrastructure, and cybersecurity solutions to other industries gives the attackers a foothold in the digital supply chain, enabling them to extend their reach to downstream entities.</p>\n<p>The abuse of Visual Studio Code Remote Tunnels in this campaign illustrates how Chinese APT groups often rely on practical, solution-oriented approaches to evade detection. By leveraging a trusted development tool and infrastructure, the threat actors aimed to disguise their malicious activities as legitimate.

SentinelLabs and Tinexta Cyber detected and interrupted the activities in their initial phases.\nThe threat actors used a lateral movement capability indicative of the presence of a shared vendor or digital quartermaster maintaining and provisioning tooling within the Chinese APT ecosystem.\nThe threat actors abused Visual Studio Code and Microsoft Azure infrastructure for C2 purposes, attempting to evade detection by making malicious activities appear legitimate.\nOur visibility suggests that the abuse of Visual Studio Code for C2 purposes had been relatively rare in the wild prior to this campaign. Operation Digital Eye marks the first instance of a suspected Chinese APT group using this technique that we have directly observed.\nOverview\nTinexta Cyber and SentinelLabs have been tracking threat activities targeting business-to-business IT service providers in Southern Europe. Based on the malware, infrastructure, techniques used, victimology, and the timing of the activities, we assess that it is highly likely these attacks were conducted by a China-nexus threat actor with cyberespionage motivations.\nThe relationships between European countries and China are complex, characterized by cooperation, competition, and underlying tensions in areas such as trade, investment, and technology. Suspected China-linked cyberespionage groups frequently target public and private organizations across Europe to gather strategic intelligence, gain competitive advantages, and advance geopolitical, economic, and technological interests.\nThe attack campaign, which we have dubbed Operation Digital Eye, took place from late June to mid-July 2024, lasting approximately three weeks. The targeted organizations provide solutions for managing data, infrastructure, and cybersecurity for clients across various industries, making them prime targets for cyberespionage actors.\nA sustained presence within these organizations would provide the Operation Digital Eye actors with a strategic foothold, creating opportunities for intrusions across the digital supply chain and enabling them to exert control over critical IT processes within the downstream compromised entities. The attacks were detected and disrupted during their initial phases.\nThe exact group behind Operation Digital Eye remains unclear due to the extensive sharing of malware, operational playbooks, and infrastructure management processes within the Chinese threat landscape. The threat actors used a pass-the-hash capability, likely originating from the same source as closed-source custom Mimikatz modifications observed exclusively in suspected Chinese cyberespionage activities, such as Operation Soft Cell and Operation Tainted Love. The malware and tooling used in these campaigns have been linked to several distinct Chinese APT groups. We collectively refer to these custom Mimikatz modifications as mimCN.\nThe long-term evolution and versioning of mimCN samples, along with notable features such as instructions left for a separate team of operators, suggest the involvement of a shared vendor or digital quartermaster responsible for the active maintenance and provisioning of tooling. This function within the Chinese APT ecosystem, corroborated by the I-Soon leak, likely plays a key role in facilitating China-nexus cyberespionage operations.\nThe abuse of Visual Studio Code Remote Tunnels for C2 purposes is central to this campaign. Originally designed to enable remote development, this technology provides full endpoint access, including command execution and filesystem manipulation. Additionally, Visual Studio Code tunneling involves executables signed by Microsoft and Microsoft Azure network infrastructure, both of which are often not closely monitored and are typically allowed by application controls and firewall rules. As a result, this technique may be challenging to detect and could evade security defenses. Combined with the full endpoint access it provides, this makes Visual Studio Code tunneling an attractive and powerful capability for threat actors to exploit.\nTinexta Cyber and SentinelLabs have notified Microsoft about the abuse of Visual Studio Code and Azure infrastructure in connection with Operation Digital Eye.\nInfection Vector and Attack Progression\nThe attackers used SQL (Structured Query Language) injection as an initial access vector to infiltrate Internet-facing web and database servers. User-Agent request headers in the web traffic logs we retrieved indicate that the attackers used the sqlmap tool to automate the detection and exploitation of SQL injection vulnerabilities.\nTo establish an initial foothold and maintain persistent access, the threat actors deployed a PHP-based webshell. Relatively simple in design and implementation, the webshell uses the assert function to execute attacker-provided PHP code. Its implementation does not resemble any other webshells we are familiar with. We track this webshell under the name PHPsert.\nTo disguise the files implementing PHPsert and attempt to evade detection based on filesystem activity, the attackers used custom names tailored to the infiltrated environments, making the filenames appear legitimate. This included using the local language and terms that aligned with the technological context of the targeted organizations.\nAfter establishing an initial foothold, the threat actors conducted reconnaissance using a variety of third-party tools and built-in Windows utilities, such as GetUserInfo and ping. They also deployed the local.exe tool, which is part of the Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit and allows for viewing user group memberships.\nTo steal credentials, the attackers used the CreateDump tool to extract memory allocated to the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process and exfiltrate credentials. CreateDump is part of the Microsoft .NET Framework distribution. The threat actors also retrieved credentials from the Security Account Manager (SAM) database, which they extracted from the Windows Registry using the reg save command.\nThe threat actors frequently named the files they deployed using the pattern do.*. Examples include do.log (output from ping commands), do.exe (the CreateDump tool), and do.bat (a script that executes and deletes the CreateDump executable).\nFrom the initially compromised endpoints, the attackers moved laterally across the internal network, primarily using RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) connections and pass-the-hash techniques. For the pass-the-hash attacks, they used a custom modified version of Mimikatz, implemented in an executable named bK2o.exe.\nIn addition to the PHPsert webshell, the threat actors used two methods for remote command execution: SSH access, enabled by deploying authorized_keys files containing public keys for authentication, and Visual Studio Code Remote Tunnels.\nVisual Studio Code Remote Tunnels, based on Microsoft’s dev tunnel technology, enable developers to access and work on remote systems. This access includes the command terminal and file system, allowing activities such as command execution and file editing. The Operation Digital Eye actors abused this functionality to maintain persistent backdoor access to compromised systems.\nIn an attempt to evade detection based on filesystem activity, the threat actors used %SystemRoot%\\Temp and %ProgramData%\\Visual Studio Code as their primary working directories for storing tools and data. %SystemRoot%\\Temp is a directory where Windows stores temporary files and is often monitored with less scrutiny. %ProgramData%\\Visual Studio Code was intended to appear as a legitimate directory associated with Visual Studio Code.\nThe intrusions were detected and interrupted before the attackers could proceed to further phases, such as exfiltrating data.\nAbuse of Visual Studio Code\nThe threat actors deployed a portable Visual Studio Code executable named code.exe, which is digitally signed by Microsoft, and used the winsw tool to run it as a Windows service. The winsw configuration file we retrieved indicates that the attackers created a service named Visual Studio Code Service, which executes code.exe with the tunnel command-line parameter at every system startup.\nThe configuration file reveals a pragmatic approach by the threat actors, who likely modified a publicly available winsw configuration. This is suggested by the use of the myapp service identifier and the %BASE%\\logs directory for storing winsw log files, both of which appear in the public configuration file as well as in the one we retrieved.\nwinsw configuration file\nThe tunnel parameter instructs Visual Studio Code to create a dev tunnel and act as a server to which remote users can connect. After authenticating to the tunnel with a Microsoft or GitHub account, remote users can access the endpoint running the Visual Studio Code server, either through the Visual Studio Code desktop application or the browser-based version, vscode.dev.\nAfter creating the dev tunnels, the threat actors authenticated using GitHub accounts and accessed the compromised endpoints through the browser-based version of Visual Studio Code. We have no knowledge of whether the threat actors used self-registered or compromised GitHub accounts to authenticate to the tunnels.\nNetwork Infrastructure\nThe Operation Digital Eye actors used infrastructure located exclusively within Europe, sourced from the provider M247 and the Cloud platform Microsoft Azure. This was likely part of a deliberate strategy. Since the targeted organizations are based and operate within Europe, the attackers may have aimed to minimize suspicion by aligning their infrastructure’s location with that of their targets. Additionally, Cloud infrastructure commonly used in legitimate IT workflows, such as Microsoft Azure, is often not closely monitored and is frequently allowed through firewall restrictions. By leveraging public Cloud infrastructure for malicious purposes, the attackers made the traffic appear legitimate, which can be challenging to detect and may evade security defenses.\nIn the initial phases of the attacks, the threat actors used the server with IP address 146.70.161[.]78 to establish initial access by detecting and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities, and the server with IP address 185.76.78[.]117 to operate the PHPsert webshell. Both IP addresses are allocated to the infrastructure provider M247 and are located in Poland and Italy, respectively.\nIn the later phases of the attacks, the threat actors used the server with IP address 4.232.170[.]137 for C2 purposes when remotely accessing compromised endpoints via the SSH protocol. This server is part of Microsoft’s Azure infrastructure in the Italy North datacenter region (Azure IP range: 4.232.128[.]0/18, service tag: AzureCloud.italynorth). We currently have no information on whether the threat actors used self-registered or compromised Azure credentials to access and manage the Azure resources and services.\nThe abuse of Visual Studio Code tunneling for C2 purposes also relies on Microsoft Azure infrastructure. Creating and hosting a dev tunnel requires connecting to a Microsoft Azure server with a domain of *.[clusterID].devtunnels.ms, where [clusterID] corresponds to the Azure region of the endpoint running the Visual Studio Code server, such as euw for West Europe. In Operation Digital Eye, the creation of dev tunnels involved establishing connections to the server with the domain [REDACTED].euw.devtunnels[.]ms, which resolved to the IP address 20.103.221[.]187. This server is part of Microsoft’s Azure infrastructure in the West Europe datacenter region (Azure IP range: 20.103.0[.]0/16, service tag: AzureCloud.westeurope).\nThe PHPsert Webshell\nPHPsert executes attacker-provided PHP code using the assert function, which, in PHP versions prior to 8.0.0, interprets and runs parameter strings as PHP code. To hinder static analysis and evade detection, the webshell uses various code obfuscation techniques, including XOR encoding, hexadecimal character representation, string concatenation, and randomized variable names.\nPHPsert implementation\nThe PHPsert webshell operates as follows:\nPHPsert instantiates a class with a single regular method, which XOR-decodes and concatenates hexadecimal characters to generate the string assert. The class’s destructor (the magic method __destruct) uses this string to invoke the assert function, passing attacker-provided PHP code as a parameter.\nThe webshell retrieves the attacker-provided PHP code from an HTTP POST request parameter, for example, momomomo. If the id parameter is present in the request URL, PHPsert decodes the Base64-encoded value of the POST parameter. If the id parameter is absent, the webshell uses the raw value of the parameter.\nFinally, when PHPsert finishes executing, the class’s destructor is invoked, which in turn calls the assert function to execute the attacker-provided PHP code.\nWe identified multiple PHPsert variants, which have been submitted to malware sharing platforms since May 2023, from various locations including Japan, Singapore, Peru, Taiwan, Iran, Korea, and the Philippines. These variants show only minor differences in their implementation, such as varying variable names and POST request parameters like mr6, brute, and qq. Our analysis suggests that PHPsert is deployed not only as a standalone PHP file but is also integrated into various types of web content, including web text editors and content management systems.\nOne of the PHPsert variants contains commented-out code snippets and comments in simplified Chinese that describe nearby code. These comments and snippets are not present in the PHPsert versions observed in Operation Digital Eye, nor in any of the webshell’s other variants. Below are the code comments, all of which are machine-translated from simplified Chinese:\n结果是\"assert\", which translates to The result is \"assert\".\n验证 $this->rg 是否安全, which translates to Verify that $this->rg is safe.\n验证和清理用户输入, which translates to Validating and sanitizing user input.\n\n\nPHPsert code snippets with comments in Chinese\nThe presence of these comments, along with the indicators of removed code across PHPsert variants, suggests the potential involvement of Chinese-speaking developers who may have been simplifying the webshell’s execution logic.\nPass-the-Hash Capability\nThe bK2o.exe executable (a custom modified version of Mimikatz used in Operation Digital Eye for pass-the-hash attacks) enables the execution of processes within a user’s security context by leveraging a compromised NTLM password hash, bypassing the need for the user’s actual password. To achieve this, bK2o.exe overwrites memory of the LSASS process. The tool supports the following command-line parameters:\n/c: The process to execute; defaults to cmd.exe if not provided.\n/u: The user’s username.\n/d: The user’s domain.\n/h: The NTLM password hash.\nbK2o.exe implements a pass-the-hash technique by overwriting LSASS memory in a manner similar to Mimikatz, with its implementation partially overlapping with Mimikatz functions such as kuhl_m_sekurlsa_pth_luid and kuhl_m_sekurlsa_msv_enum_cred_callback_pth. In summary, bK2o.exe performs the following:\nCreates a suspended process in a new logon session, specifying the attacker-provided process, username, domain, and an empty password.\nBased on the session’s locally unique identifier (LUID), locates and extracts from the LSASS process memory an encrypted credential data blob containing the user’s NTLM hash and the encryption keys required to decrypt the blob.\nDecrypts the data blob, overwrites the user’s NTLM hash with the attacker-provided hash, and re-encrypts the data blob.\nResumes the suspended process.\nbK2o.exe creates a new process and retrieves the logon session’s LUID\nTo navigate LSASS memory, bK2o.exe uses code signatures, represented as byte sequences in hexadecimal format. These sequences correspond to known LSASS instructions, which serve as navigation points within the memory.\nTo hinder static analysis and evade detection, bK2o.exe obfuscates code signatures and strings by constructing them dynamically on the stack at runtime, instead of storing them as static data.\nbK2o.exe constructs the string lsasrv.dll on the stack\nbK2o.exe constructs the code signature 33 ff 41 89 37 4c 8b f3 […] on the stack\nFrom Operation Digital Eye to Tainted Love and Soft Cell\nWe identified two additional samples uploaded to malware sharing platforms that construct code signatures on the stack, which we refer to as wsx1.exe and wsx1.exe. Like bK2o.exe, both wsx.exe and wsx1.exe are custom modified versions of Mimikatz and implement pass-the-hash functionality.\nSubstantial code segments in wsx.exe and wsx1.exe, which implement the construction of code signatures on the stack, overlap with those in bK2o.exe, including identical mov instruction operand sizes and values. This suggests that wsx.exe, wsx1.exe, and bK2o.exe are highly likely derived from the same source.\nCode segment in bK2o.exe\nCode segment in wsx1.exe\nIn turn, we observed overlaps between wsx.exe, wsx1.exe, and mim221 components. mim221 is a versioned and well-maintained credential theft tool, also a custom modified version of Mimikatz, which SentinelLabs observed in Operation Tainted Love — a campaign targeting telecommunication providers in the Middle East in 2023.\nWe attributed Operation Tainted Love to a suspected Chinese cyberespionage group within the nexus of Granite Typhoon (formerly known as Gallium) and APT41, while acknowledging the possibility of tool sharing among Chinese state-sponsored threat actors and the potential involvement of a shared vendor or digital quartermaster. We assess that mim221 represents an evolution of tooling associated with Operation Soft Cell, such as simplify_32.exe. Operation Soft Cell, which targeted telecommunication providers in 2017 and 2018, has been linked to Granite Typhoon, and possible connections between the Soft Cell actors and APT41 have also been suggested.\nmim221 has a multi-component architecture, with a single executable staging three components — pc.dll, AddSecurityPackage64.dll, and getHashFlsa64.dll — using techniques such as decryption, injection, and reflective image loading. These components share several overlaps with bK2o.exe, wsx.exe, and wsx1.exe.\nTo hinder static analysis, some mim221 components also obfuscate strings by constructing them on the stack at runtime. Additionally, the mim221 components AddSecurityPackage64.dll and getHashFlsa64.dll implement error logging similar to that of wsx.exe and wsx1.exe, including identical custom error messages, a consistent output format, and the same English-language errors.\nError messages in mim221\nError messages in wsx.exe and wsx1.exe\nIn addition, RTTI (Run-Time Type Information) information stored in wsx.exe, wsx1.exe, and the mim221 component getHashFlsa64.dll reveals that classes with the same names are declared across these executables. We have not observed these class names in open-source or publicly available tooling.\nClass names (those present in more than one executable are highlighted in bold)\nmimCN | A Collection of China-Nexus APT Tools\nDue to the previously discussed overlaps between bK2o.exe (used in Operation Digital Eye), wsx.exe, wsx1.exe, mim221 components (used in Operation Tainted Love), and simplify_32.exe (used in Operation Soft Cell), we collectively refer to this collection of tools as mimCN.\nThe mimCN samples bK2o.exe, wsx.exe, wsx1.exe, and mim221\nWe include in the mimCN tool collection not only the previously mentioned tools but also any other custom modifications of Mimikatz that have overlaps with other mimCN executables, suggesting they may originate from the same source. Such overlaps include shared code-signing certificates and the use of unique custom error messages or obfuscation techniques.\nTo date, we have observed mimCN tools exclusively in the context of suspected Chinese APT activities. Although the compilation timestamps of the mimCN samples observed in these intrusions could have been manipulated, the proximity of the timestamps to when the activities occurred suggests that they are likely authentic.\nOperation\nmimCN sample\nCompilation timestamp (UTC)\n\n\nDigital Eye\nbK2o.exe\nThu May 30 08:47:56 2024\n\n\nTainted Love\nmim221 (pc.exe)\nThu Jun 09 08:02:12 2022\n\n\nTainted Love\nmim221 (AddSecurityPackage64.dll)\nThu Jun 09 08:01:46 2022\n\n\nTainted Love\nmim221 (pc.dll)\nTue Jun 07 16:55:05 2022\n\n\nTainted Love\nmim221 (getHashFlsa64.dll)\nFri May 27 20:56:26 2022\n\n\nSoft Cell\nsimplify_32.exe\nTue Nov 20 03:54:21 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nUse of mimCN samples\nFurther, unique usage instructions found in some mimCN samples, such as [ERROR]Please input command. eg, /cmd:xxx  and [ERROR]Please input ip. eg, /ip:xx.XXX.xx.x or /ip:xxx.com, suggest the involvement of a dedicated development team that is leaving instructions for a separate group of operators. Combined with the presence of overlapping mimCN samples across various intrusions attributed to China-nexus APT groups and distributed over years, this suggests that mimCN is likely the product of an entity responsible for maintaining and provisioning tools to multiple clusters within the Chinese APT ecosystem.\nAttribution Analysis\nWe assess that Operation Digital Eye was highly likely conducted by a China-nexus cluster with cyberespionage motivations. The specific group responsible remains unclear due to the extensive sharing of malware, operational playbooks, and infrastructure management processes among Chinese APT clusters. Our assessment is based on a collective consideration of multiple indicators, including the malware, infrastructure, and techniques used, victimology, and the timing of the activities.\nMalware\nA variant of the PHPsert webshell contains code comments in simplified Chinese. This suggests the potential involvement of Chinese-speaking developers. Further, the custom Mimikatz modification bK2o.exe used in Operation Digital Eye is part of the mimCN collection and shares implementation overlaps with other custom Mimikatz modifications, suggesting a common origin. These tools have been observed exclusively in the context of suspected Chinese APT activities, such as Operation Soft Cell and Operation Tainted Love. Malware and tooling used in these operations have been associated with the suspected Chinese APT groups Granite Typhoon and APT41, and possible connections to other China-nexus groups, such as APT10 and Lucky Mouse have also been suggested.\nThe mimCN tool collection suggests the presence of a shared vendor or digital quartermaster responsible for the sustained development and provisioning of tools to groups within the Chinese APT ecosystem. This function is suspected to play a significant role in the Chinese threat landscape. The I-Soon leak, which offers rare insight into China’s cyberespionage activities, provides supporting evidence for the existence of digital quartermasters within this landscape.\nInfrastructure\nWhile not exclusive to Chinese APT groups, the use of M247 infrastructure, as seen in Operation Digital Eye, has been common among them in recent years. One example is the M247 infrastructure attributed to the suspected Chinese cluster STORM-0866 (also known as Red Dev 40), with which the Sandman APT group is associated.\nAdditionally, the use of Cloud services and resources located in geographic proximity to the targeted organizations in Operation Digital Eye suggests a carefully planned and targeted infrastructure management approach. In this context, we suspect the potential involvement of third-party entities tasked with administering and provisioning infrastructure, a practice that has become increasingly common in the Chinese APT ecosystem in recent years.\nAbuse of Visual Studio Code\nOur visibility into threat actor activities suggests that the abuse of Visual Studio Code tunneling for C2 purposes was relatively rare in the wild before Operation Digital Eye.\nPrevious research indicates that, starting in 2023, a suspected North Korean group has used Visual Studio Remote Tunnels to maintain persistence in compromised networks. Additionally, in October 2024, Cyble released a report documenting unattributed activity in which threat actors distributed a Windows Shortcut (LNK) file to deploy Visual Studio Code and activate its tunneling feature to establish remote access.\nAs of this writing, the only publicly disclosed use of this technique around the time of Operation Digital Eye has been attributed to a suspected Chinese APT group. In September 2024, Unit 42 published a report on a campaign targeting government entities in Southeast Asia, in which threat actors used Visual Studio Code as a backdoor. The campaign was attributed to Stately Taurus (also known as Mustang Panda). The exact timeline of the campaign is unclear, with mid-August 2024 being the only reference point explicitly mentioned in the Unit 42 report. Based on this, we suspect that Operation Digital Eye occurred prior to this activity.\nWe did not observe any overlaps in TTPs between Operation Digital Eye and the activity reported by Unit 42, except for the abuse of Visual Studio Code. We recognize the possibility that distinct Chinese APT clusters may share operational playbooks that include leveraging Visual Studio Code for C2 purposes.\nTemporal Analysis\nOur analysis of timestamps marking the dates and times of operator activity in the targeted organizations showed that all activities occurred on workdays (Monday to Friday). Additionally, converting the timestamps from their original time zones, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and Central European Summer Time (CEST, UTC+2), to China Standard Time (CST, UTC+8) revealed that the operators were primarily active during typical working hours in China, mostly between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. CST.\nThis suggests a potentially state-sanctioned operation. The ‘996’ work schedule (9 a.m. to 9 p.m. CST, six days a week) has been common in China’s technology sector, but it was ruled illegal by the Supreme People’s Court in 2021. As a result, state employees are almost certainly restricted to weekday work, typically between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m., aligning closely with our observations from the timestamp analysis.\nThe figure below shows the total number of connections established by the threat actors to Visual Studio Code tunnels throughout Operation Digital Eye, broken down by hour of the day. The data is presented in both the original time zone (CEST) and in China Standard Time (CST, CEST+6). We observed minimal to no activity between 10 p.m. and 9 a.m. CST, as well as between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. CST, which aligns with the typical daily working hours in China, including the midday lunch break.\nNumber of established connections to Visual Studio Code tunnels\nConclusions\nOperation Digital Eye highlights the persistent threat posed by Chinese cyberespionage groups to European entities, with these threat actors continuing to focus on high-value targets. The campaign underscores the strategic nature of this threat, as breaching organizations that provide data, infrastructure, and cybersecurity solutions to other industries gives the attackers a foothold in the digital supply chain, enabling them to extend their reach to downstream entities.\nThe abuse of Visual Studio Code Remote Tunnels in this campaign illustrates how Chinese APT groups often rely on practical, solution-oriented approaches to evade detection. By leveraging a trusted development tool and infrastructure, the threat actors aimed to disguise their malicious activities as legitimate. The exploitation of widely used technologies, which security teams may not scrutinize closely, presents a growing challenge for organizations. For defenders, this calls for a reevaluation of traditional security approaches and the implementation of robust detection mechanisms to identify such evasive techniques in real time.\nLateral movement capabilities observed in Operation Digital Eye, linked to custom Mimikatz modifications used in previous campaigns, indicate the potential involvement of shared vendors or digital quartermasters and the important function they serve in the Chinese APT ecosystem. These centralized entities provide continuity and adaptability to cyberespionage operations, equipping threat actors with consistently updated tools and evolving tactics as they target new victims.\nIndicators of Compromise\nSHA1 Hashes\nValue\nNote\n\n\n0be9dd709d7d68887a92c793881dd4a010796e95\nThe CreateDump tool (do.exe)\n\n\n213f06ed5ac9e688816b4bbe73bf507994949964\nThe GetUserInfo tool\n\n\n289f3bfe297923507cf4c26ca500ae01819c6a95\nThe local.exe tool\n\n\n2e2cf8a4a0e7decceb8e22536b13173479da0d13\nPHPsert variant\n\n\n3035d8846d7a9f309f2d24daba6ac33ad99524fc\nPHPsert variant\n\n\n399776991a094e1ee78b2a915bf4491e67c04ec7\nPHPsert variant\n\n\n3a688c844259822c51ceb3aea508303c4a654eb3\nPHPsert variant\n\n\n4d6947a19dd9a420c22fee39fac8b4df95a47569\nPHPsert variant\n\n\n63cea28d927f8e629377399fa08a9cb4fd0c6238\nPHPsert variant\n\n\n6549e50645bb1c02e4972651d335a75cb6d5aa74\nPHPsert variant\n\n\n7941909fd5c1277c6f7baf21e484c9e59ea454ee\nmimCN (bK2o.exe)\n\n\n7cb7bcb9187f8faf47fd77cf1213ab3fe2350a77\nmimCN (simplify_32.exe)\n\n\n82b1cb9b69d5f05bb20852322fb3c2c00bce9134\nmimCN (wsx.exe)\n\n\n83ca53c95705352ff60149b0b17a686956e23172\nPHPsert variant\n\n\na9d6d0c47728094feb794ad7e25c253737633140\nVisual Studio Code (code.exe)\n\n\nb2811cb4d0afe13d2722093039a72588c348dcfd\nPHPsert variant\n\n\nc0e03fce8f7f51e91da79f773aa870f0897b0ee2\nPHPsert variant\n\n\ncb6726fb3f7952ede04ed22d2c72389255991827\nPHPsert variant\n\n\nd57fa43944676c56e66f4b20ffa3d82048e354fd\nPHPsert variant\n\n\ne572380ab95c4ab5a87f701d4654d3386911b387\ndo.bat\n\n\ne8a8d8fa7122c1592a314343b45bac2c213bb57d\nmimCN (wsx1.exe)\n\n\n\n\nIP Addresses\nValue\nNote\n\n\n146.70.161[.]78\nServer used for initial access (SQL injection attack)\n\n\n185.76.78[.]117\nC2 server (PHPsert webshells)\n\n\n20.103.221[.]187\nVisual Studio Code dev tunnel\n\n\n4.232.170[.]137\nC2 server (SSH access)\n\n\n\n\nDomains\nValue\nNote\n\n\n[REDACTED].euw.devtunnels[.]ms\nVisual Studio Code dev tunnel","enclosure":{"url":"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op-Digital-Eye-ftr.jpg","length":"524719","type":"image/jpeg"},"dc:creator":"Aleksandar Milenkoski &amp; Luigi Martire (Tinexta Cyber)","content":"Threat actors abused Visual Studio Code and Microsoft Azure infrastructure to target large business-to-business IT service providers in Southern Europe.","contentSnippet":"Threat actors abused Visual Studio Code and Microsoft Azure infrastructure to target large business-to-business IT service providers in Southern Europe.","guid":"https://www.sentinelone.com/?post_type=labs&p=109526","categories":["China"],"isoDate":"2024-12-10T10:55:33.000Z","tag":"intel"},{"creator":"LABScon","title":"LABScon24 Replay | PKfail: Supply-Chain Failures in Secure Boot Key Management","link":"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/labscon24-replay-pkfail-supply-chain-failures-in-secure-boot-key-management/","pubDate":"Tue, 03 Dec 2024 16:15:30 +0000","content:encoded":"<p>Modern computing heavily relies on establishing and maintaining trust, which begins with trusted foundations and extends through operating systems and applications in a chain-like manner.

Though primarily composed of lower-skilled threat actors that reach for and use whatever works for them, we continue to see how quickly the group is able to move and adapt.</p>\n<p>The reuse of tools like AzzaSec Ransom, Diamond RW, and even more established ones like LockBit and Chaos, demonstrates just how dynamic these affiliations and alliances between hacktivist groups can be. Not only are such groups touting new tools within short time frames only to abandon them and pivot to something else later, the number of hacktivist groups is also growing. Infighting and tensions amongst them are also fuel for the rates of growth and change &#8211; as alliances crumble or shift, the threat environment stays highly volatile and dynamic, making it more difficult for cyber defenders to track their activities consistently.</p>\n<p>As groups like CyberVolk leverage openly-available commodity tools with high potential for causing damage, they continue to add more layers of complexity, expanding and revising the tools as they are passed around within the collective. Ransomware operations will only get muddier and increase how much cybersecurity teams will need to monitor in order to stay up to date on the happenings within the cybercrime ecosystem.</p>\n<h2>Indicators of Compromise</h2>\n<div style=\"font-size:0.8em\">\n<p><strong>CyberVolk</strong><br />\n0ce59e479ec6eacd3a44ed3de2dc572676e5b2dd<br />\n16bf55122bbb6073cc1d77ce23e2a8e6052f9ec1 | Stealer<br />\n3bf6a90017bf22083ab735ecf3f8589a3f220e53 | Ransom note<br />\n5d8bed459f55a37e2fcb801d04de337a01c5d623 | Ransom note<br />\n813c510fb2463ecc6dff7795ef96744ca82544b3 | Webshell<br />\nb958fb7241cc9675b8dd967b02df6a6ad92de52d<br />\nc70d2350cbac3d0abeb896adcce2fcf243943633 | Webshell<br />\neae366ee4a7c19a87bc5ab9360f4333907a6a387<br />\nf5d0c94b2be91342dc01ecf2f89e7e6f21a74b90</p>\n<p><strong>AzzaSec</strong><br />\n5499da31260a4aa75eea46c1d4aa6559074749a8 | Ransomware (src)</p>\n<p><strong>Invisible / Doubleface Team</strong><br />\n197d5c9c5cbf53ed3e78d53a008b6ad665fa3e4c<br />\n1f325950a7a8e1a2050e954f33d2c3774510bd6e<br />\n59e293623e4fb828a29fb982d5ac9a4f993abc3b<br />\nd35da3f4e36eebf36a130bc7e0182fc4c35cf551 | Archive</p>\n<p><strong>HexaLocker</strong><br />\n11288fb54c6f2ed4d8cddfb004c754e5e9c35ad5<br />\n4c24fdf504af452fb7245db33bfc1dc4f72c04a8<br />\n4f8e1e7bfd484cf312fdc77e8687086f6f6007c<br />\n7ba4eb7842730bbc82fc129a3f3d4a239ac436c2<br />\n84dacf9da57d9d69c2ca711831895bf185834b8c<br />\n904f46ef4c66ccf844bf31d37c11298fb7f65157<br />\n93334882ff3c03c42b1179d9db0c165c99145369<br />\na4b7ef2ca1d5fda318505cac6757b5313b47eeac<br />\nb6a9c5692b76f2defc1c170bdce0e41d91d706db<br />\nbe581fc1f430dd6855effd9e54429c5c5fcb9f8c | Ransom note<br />\ncd8f934fa7ba7817bb62f0e4b968b3f124355b60</p>\n<p><strong>PDBs</strong> </p>\n<pre>\r\nC:/Users/zzart/Desktop/HexaLocker RaaS/crypter.go\r\nC:/Users/zzart/Desktop/MalwareDeveloppement/HexaLocker RaaS/decrypt_key.go\r\nC:/Users/zzart/Desktop/MalwareDeveloppement/HexaLocker RaaS/crypterV1.go\r\n</pre>\n<p><strong>DNS</strong><br />\ndarkslategray-baboon-853641[.]hostingersite[.]com</p>\n<p><strong>LAPSUS$/HexaLocker</strong><br />\n481830db2daf40607748bd9624e970781e7f4408<br />\ne1d8993ef4bbc8d2aa331262e5422d91865acc4f</p>\n<p><strong>Parano</strong><br />\n3ce26f45f5da58ab75b4d1cecc78c3bbe275f708 | Stealer (archive)<br />\n4581b30e6f5946a570963cd76dc79beaa8bcf1c3 | ScreenLocker<br />\n91abb7fadf847f3810bbe0734e3c31d5dc7bce6d | ScreenLocker<br />\nb5d8e690a75f07e7d3e18fcc5b86bfe2362a3300 | ScreenLocker\n</div>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"Executive Summary\nCyberVolk/GLORIAMIST is a hacktivist collective originating in India with pro-Russia leanings. Between June and October 2024, CyberVolk claimed responsibility for multiple ransomware attacks.\nThe main objective of CyberVolk and related groups is to leverage geopolitical issues to launch and justify attacks on public and government entities, primarily in the service of Russian government interests.\nSentinelLabs has observed a shared codebase used by CyberVolk, AzzaSec and DoubleFace’s ransomware. Additionally, CyberVolk has promoted other ransomware families like HexaLocker and Parano. These groups and the tools they leverage are all closely intertwined.\nThese hacktivist groups are extremely dynamic and volatile. In-fighting, threats, and inflated political-posturing are common, leading to fragmentation and the rapid re-shaping of the hacktivist threat landscape.\nIntroduction\nCyberVolk is a politically motivated hacktivist collective which launched its own RaaS in June 2024. The group uses both DDoS and ransomware attacks in its efforts to undermine and disrupt the operations of those opposed to Russian interests.\nThe group has become an increasingly prominent player within the cybercrime ecosystem, adopting and repurposing existing commodity malware to advance its causes. Highly-skilled actors within the collective expand and revise such tools, effectively making them more sophisticated as they move through various hands.\nThe CyberVolk collective is a prime example of how readily threat actors can access and deploy dangerous ransomware builders such as AzzaSec, Diamond, LockBit, Chaos and others. This adaptability makes the group highly dynamic and increasingly challenging to track.\nIn this post, we provide an overview of a number of ransomware families within the context of CyberVolk’s operations, breaking down the increasingly blurred lines between tools and group affiliations. Understanding the shifting nature of dynamic hacktivist collectives like CyberVolk can help organizations prepare and fortify their defenses.\nThe Origins of CyberVolk Ransomware\nCyberVolk is a pro-India/pro-Russia “hacktivist” group that has been actively targeting entities in multiple countries. In its current form, it emerged during May 2024. Prior to this, the group was known by a few different names, including GLORIAMIST, GLORIAMIST India and Solntsevskaya Bratva. CyberVolk exploits current geopolitical issues, focused on launching and justifying its attacks on public and government entities.\n\nWhile the group claims alliances with other broad groups such as LAPSUS$, Anonymous, and the Moroccan Dragons, it has also been associated with NONAME057(16) and other RU-friendly, DDoS-focused, groups. However, CyberVolk has also embraced ransomware as a tool to further its cause, with self-branded ransomware payloads as well as alliances with associated ransomware families, namely Doubleface, HexaLocker, and the Parano family.\nCyberVolk’s branded ransomware is derived from the AzzaSec (aka AzzaSecurity) ransomware code. AzzaSec is a pro-Russia, anti-Israel, and anti-Ukraine hacktivist group that emerged in February of 2024. It has claimed alliances with some of the same groups linked to CyberVolk such as NONAME057(16). Initially conducting DDoS and defacement attacks, the group later expanded into extortion and ransomware.\nJune 2024 Release of AzzaSec Ransomware\nIn June, the source-code for “AzzaSec Ransom” was leaked and subsequently adopted and adapted by multiple groups aligned with AzzaSec’s mission. Prior to its disbandment in August of 2024, AzzaSec operated under a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model and pushed out multiple iterations of its Windows-centric ransomware.\nAzzaSec “disbandment” announcement, August 2024\nPost-AzzaSec | The Rise of CyberVolk’s RaaS Operations\nThe CyberVolk-branded RaaS was announced in late June 2024.\nCyberVolk Ransomware Announcement, June 2024\nThe CyberVolk-modified ransomware’s development is credited to @ghostdoor_maldev and is based on the earlier AzzaSec Ransomware code. The Windows-specific payloads are written in C++. Upon execution, the payloads drop bitmap images (files with extension .bmp) into %temp% folder, and display them, prior to any encryption occurring. The ransomware will terminate any running processes belonging to either Microsoft Management Console (MMC) or Task Manager.\nCyberVolk Ransomware MMC processes and Task Manager Termination\nEarly versions of CyberVolk Ransomware used the AES algorithm for file encryption and the SHA512 algorithm for key generation. This was later updated to “ChaCha20-Poly1305 + AES + RSA + Quantum resistant algorithms” according to posts on the group’s Telegram.\nCyberVolk wallpaper with countdown timer\nThe payment screen used by CyberVolk Ransomware displays the decryption timer along with payment details. CyberVolk ransomware supports BTC and USDT payments. Across all the functional samples we analyzed, the timeout value was set to 5 hours, with the ransom amount set to $1000.00 (equivalent in BTC or USDT). A ransom note named CyberVolk_Readme.txt containing the same contact details presented in the wallpaper and payment screens is also dropped to disk. Telegram contact details are provided as well.\nCyberVolk ransom note\nThe .CyberVolk extension is added to affected files:\nCyberVolk-encrypted files\nThe decryption timer is controlled via a time.dat file written to %appdata%\\Roaming directory. The timeout is set to 5 hours in CyberVolk samples analyzed by SentinelOne. This functionality is mirrored in the Invisible Ransom payloads as well, as they are based on the same codebase (AzzaSec Ransom).\nDecryption timer in CyberVolk\nThe time.dat file stores the defined timeout value in seconds. Default builds of Invisible Ransom (or CyberVolk) will write time.dat with a value of 17967 seconds (roughly 5 hours).\nCyberVolk has continued to utilize their branded ransomware payloads, more recently in attacks against entities in Japan, and hype up these attacks across their various channels (e.g., Telegram, X, Discord). These campaigns were part of “#OpJP” which extended through October. Victims of “#OpJP” include:\nThe Japan Foundation\nJapan Oceanographic Data Center (JODC)\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)\nTokyo Global Information System Centre\nCyberVolk and #OpJP (Targeting Japan)\nCyberVolk Associates | Invisible/Doubleface Team Ransomware\nInvisible or Doubleface ransomware is associated with “Doubleface Team” (aka Double Alliance). This group emerged in August-September 2024 as a convergence of associates within CyberVolk, Doubleface, and Moroccan Black Cyber Army. CyberVolk began promoting Doubleface on September 22, 2024.\nSeptember 22 DoubleAlliance / CyberVolk posting\nInvisible/Doubleface ransomware payloads function in an identical manner to CyberVolk-branded ransomware samples. This includes duplication of the 5-hour timeout setting and active wallpaper modification used for input of the decryption key and displaying payment details. Both ransomware families are derived from the same AzzaSec Ransomware code base.\nInvisible/Doubleface ransomware wallpaper\nInvisible/Doubleface Source\nThe source code/builder for Invisible has been leaked publicly and distributed through various channels, mainly Telegram. As stated previously, both Invisible and CyberVolk’s payloads as of this writing are based on the same code, observed in AzzaSec Ransomware.\nInvisible Ransom source files\nThe archive contains the full Visual Studio project and source code for building new Invisible Ransom payloads, along with some already compiled samples/stubs.\nThe file ransom.cpp contains the main logic for the ransomware payload. It contains all the global variables including ransomware note template data, orchestrates all the encryption tasks, and handles any process termination or manipulation. The main ransom.cpp handles calls out to Cryptographic.cpp to process encryption tasks, including the implementation of AES/RSA (via aes.cpp and rsa.cpp respectively).\nSimilar to earlier AzzaSec ransomware examples, these payloads encrypt files via AES, then manage encryption keys and wrapping via RSA. The current implementation indicates AES-256 for file encryption, and RSA-2048 for wrapping the keys. Each file is encrypted via AES-256 (EncFile function in Cryptographic.cpp) with the AES key then encrypted via RSA-2048.\nEncrypting files in Invisible Ransom\nWe can also see the implementation of the ransom countdown mechanism in ransom.cpp. As with CyberVolk Ransom, the default timeout period is 5 hours. This is initially set via the timeLeft variable in ransom.cpp\nThe timer writes a time.dat file to %appdata%\\Roaming as we saw with CyberVolk. The 5 hour time limit for these samples is read from this path. In theory, this file could be manipulated to alter the timeout.\nTimer code in Invisible Ransom, referencing time.dat\nThe ransom.cpp source file also contains the template for the ransom notes, which are written to the same path from which the ransomware is executed as InvisibleReadMe.txt.\nInvisible Ransom’s ransom note template in “ransom.cpp”\nThe termination of MMC processes and Task Manager is also present in the Invisible Ransom source (as we also see with CyberVolk samples)\n“Lock. Demand. Dominate” | HexaLocker Ransomware\nHexaLocker is a ransomware family that first appeared in July 2024. HexaLocker is closely associated with LAPSUS$, reportedly having been originally developed by “ZZART3XX”, a proclaimed former associate of the group. HexaLocker payloads are written in Golang. As of this writing, we have only observed payloads targeting Windows systems.\nOn July 22, CyberVolk first referenced HexaLocker via one of Holy League’s posts. The Holy League is a loosely affiliated group of 70+ members born out of protest against Spain and associated arrests of members of NONAME057(16). HexaLocker’s posts and branding are all laden with their “Lock. Demand. Dominate” slogan.\nIn September 2024, HexaLocker launched a new Telegram channel after previous ones had been banned or removed. The updated channel contains details on their ongoing existence along with screenshots of the current HexaLocker panel.\nHexaLocker Telegram message\nThroughout October 2024, CyberVolk’s communication channels continued to echo messaging from HexaLocker. This includes HexaLocker’s solicitations for help in continuing to progress with HexaLocker. On October 2, 2024, HexaLocker posted an update asking for help but also teasing new features in the pipeline. These include:\nStronger anti-debug/anti-analysis features\nAdvanced obfuscations (crypting/packing)\nInclusion of EDR/XDR/AV-Killer\nPermanent AMSI bypass\nImproved process-injection\nRemote Thread Hijacking\nUAC Bypass improvements\nSelf-deletion\nInteresting developments continued with HexaLocker throughout October 2024. On October 4th, the group posted an update with a video demo claiming that an “EDR Killer” and AMSI/WD Bypass features had been added. This was followed on October 6th with an update stating that UAC bypasses had been added to the product.\nOn October 20, 2024, the actor behind the HexaLocker Telegram channel (ZZART3XX) posted their intention to officially leave and denounce LAPSUS$ as well as any peripheral affiliations. This includes the maintenance of the HexaLocker project and all the relationships and alliances that revolve around it.\nIn this announcement, the author also indicated that they would be offering HexaLocker source code, including its web panel, along with “LAPSUS$ Ransomware” source for sale.\nHexaLocker “shut down” posting via Telegram\nThis was followed the next day on October 21 with offers to sell HexaLocker and the panel infrastructure, along with associated “LAPSUS$ Ransomware”. These messages were echoed across HexaLocker, Holy League, and LAPSUS$-aligned channels.\nThe overt promotion of HexaLocker within CyberVolk channels has ceased since the HexaLocker shutdown announcement.\nParano Ransomware Within the CyberVolk Collective\nIn late October 2024, various identities in the CyberVolk community began promoting the release of Parano Ransomware v1. This appears to be another affiliation for the CyberVolk collective.\nOctober 2024 Parano Ransomware Announcement by CyberVolk\nAccording to the announcement, Parano Ransomware comes with a $400.00 USD price tag per single payload/stub. The ransomware features strong anti-analysis and anti-debugging features, and uses a combination of AES-128 and RSA-4096 for key management. \nThe Parano malware family extends beyond ransomware, also including “Parano Checker” and “Parano Stealer”, a commodity, Python-based, infostealer. The malware attempts to gather and exfiltrate browser data, Discord details, crypto wallet information and keys, along with other related software and system diagnostic details. The data can be exfiltrated via Discord webhook to a channel or location of the attacker’s choosing.\nParano Stealer Announcement, October 2024\nParano Checker is a reconnaissance and info-gathering tool capable of navigating targets and helping to isolate interesting ingress points or data repositories, or assist with dictionary/brute force attacks on certain interfaces (e.g., CPanel and WordPress login panels).\nAt the time of writing, we have not observed the executable variations of Parano (aka Paraodeus Ransomware) in the wild. The author has shared a non-malicious Python-based demo of a “ScreenLocker”. As it stands, the nature of the relationship between CyberVolk and the Parano ecosystem is still evolving.\nBeyond Ransomware | CyberVolk Stealers and Webshells\nIn addition to ransomware and other disruptive attacks, CyberVolk develops and distributes infostealer malware and webshells. The group announced the new webshell in late October 2024.\nCyberVolk Webshell announcement (Telegram)\nThe CyberVolk webshell is distributed as a standard PHP file with the actual malicious code base64-encoded inside its body.\nCyberVolk Webshell decoded\nThe publicly released version of the CyberVolk webshell provides multiple functions. The current version of the webshell allows for files to be uploaded, renamed, and downloaded. Further, attackers can traverse directories on the target server and gather environmental details.\n“CyberVolk Stealer” is distributed in the form of a Python script and is based on LBX-Grabber, an existing Python information stealer, which is in turn built into BLX-Stealer. Specifically, CyberVolk is derived from the LBX-Grabber component.\nCyberVolk Stealer Python Script\nCyberVolk Stealer attempts to gather various types of data from the system, then exfiltrates the data via Discord. Version 1 of the stealer was announced in September 2024. Core features include robust gathering of browser, discord, game and crypto wallet data. The stealer targets multiple browsers and numerous wallets.\nCyberVolk Stealer identifying sensitive data\nTelegram Exit and Weaponized Bans\nIn early November 2024, CyberVolk, and numerous affiliated groups, vanished from Telegram as a result of a mass ban of hacktivist groups. The last significant posts to the CyberVolk Telegram channels were on November 3, 2024.\nThe group subsequently announced, via Twitter/X, that it would only be using the X platform going forward. The Twitter/X account for DoubleFace, @DoubleFace_Team, made a similar announcement around the same time.\nTelegram ban updates on X\nTelegram channels belonging to CyberVolk and numerous allies appear to have been banned maliciously. We have observed specific actors claiming responsibility for attempting to close and/or extort channels belonging to AzzaSec and DoubleFace amongst others.\nIn September, some users began threatening to have rival hacktivist group channels including CyberVolk, APTZone, Doubleface, AzzaSec and others banned.\nSeptember 14, 2024 – “Matteo” targeting CyberVolk/APTZone with bans\nOn November 16, 2024, RipperSec posted their ‘perspective’ on the banning of multiple hacktivist channels, indicating that some prior members of AzzaSec and Doubleface were attempting to exhort other channels under the threat of a Telegram ban.\nNovember 13, 2024 RipperSec Telegram Post\nThis was highlighted in another post on November 13, 2024 in the “Hunt3r Kill3rs” Telegram channel. In this post, an actor referring to AzzaSec claimed “they didn’t close nobody’s channels, all the channels got closed by me”. The post went on to advise others receiving extortion threats to ignore them. “I’m the only one that is closing the hacktivist community’s channels and groups”, the actor claimed.\nNovember 13, 2024 posting in Hunt3r Kill3rs Telegram Channel\nThis weaponization of the Telegram Terms-of-Service is increasing in parallel with threat actor groups moving off Telegram to seek more clandestine and secure communication channels in response to increased scrutiny and declining trust in the platform after the arrest of Telegram founder Pavel Durov.\nConclusion\nThe number of ransomware families associated with the CyberVolk hacktivist group highlights the ability of this group to rapidly pivot, building upon existing tools to suit their needs and further their causes. Though primarily composed of lower-skilled threat actors that reach for and use whatever works for them, we continue to see how quickly the group is able to move and adapt.\nThe reuse of tools like AzzaSec Ransom, Diamond RW, and even more established ones like LockBit and Chaos, demonstrates just how dynamic these affiliations and alliances between hacktivist groups can be. Not only are such groups touting new tools within short time frames only to abandon them and pivot to something else later, the number of hacktivist groups is also growing. Infighting and tensions amongst them are also fuel for the rates of growth and change – as alliances crumble or shift, the threat environment stays highly volatile and dynamic, making it more difficult for cyber defenders to track their activities consistently.\nAs groups like CyberVolk leverage openly-available commodity tools with high potential for causing damage, they continue to add more layers of complexity, expanding and revising the tools as they are passed around within the collective. Ransomware operations will only get muddier and increase how much cybersecurity teams will need to monitor in order to stay up to date on the happenings within the cybercrime ecosystem.\nIndicators of Compromise\nCyberVolk\nAzzaSec\nInvisible / Doubleface Team\nHexaLocker\nPDBs \n\r\nC:/Users/zzart/Desktop/HexaLocker RaaS/crypter.go\r\nC:/Users/zzart/Desktop/MalwareDeveloppement/HexaLocker RaaS/decrypt_key.go\r\nC:/Users/zzart/Desktop/MalwareDeveloppement/HexaLocker RaaS/crypterV1.go\r\n\nDNS\nLAPSUS$/HexaLocker\nParano\n3ce26f45f5da58ab75b4d1cecc78c3bbe275f708 | Stealer (archive)\n4581b30e6f5946a570963cd76dc79beaa8bcf1c3 | ScreenLocker\n91abb7fadf847f3810bbe0734e3c31d5dc7bce6d | ScreenLocker\nb5d8e690a75f07e7d3e18fcc5b86bfe2362a3300 | ScreenLocker","enclosure":{"url":"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cybervolk_v2-ftr.jpg","length":"900294","type":"image/jpeg"},"dc:creator":"Jim Walter","content":"A loose collective of mostly low-skilled actors, CyberVolk absorbs and adapts a wide array of destructive malware for use against political targets.","contentSnippet":"A loose collective of mostly low-skilled actors, CyberVolk absorbs and adapts a wide array of destructive malware for use against political targets.","guid":"https://www.sentinelone.com/?post_type=labs&p=108943","categories":["Hacktivism"],"isoDate":"2024-11-25T10:55:10.000Z","tag":"intel"},{"creator":"Tom Hegel &amp; Dakota Cary","title":"DPRK IT Workers | A Network of Active Front Companies and Their Links to China","link":"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/dprk-it-workers-a-network-of-active-front-companies-and-their-links-to-china/","pubDate":"Thu, 21 Nov 2024 10:55:47 +0000","content:encoded":"<h2>Executive Summary</h2>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">SentinelLabs has identified unique characteristics of multiple websites, now seized by the US Government, associated with the DPRK IT Worker front companies.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">We assess with high confidence that DPRK actors seek to impersonate US based software and technology consulting businesses by copying the online brands of legitimate organizations, seeking to use these for financial objectives.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">SentinelLabs has linked the activity to several active front companies and links these with high confidence to a larger set of organizations being created in China.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Our findings link additional companies, which remain active today, to the DPRK IT Workers scheme.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>North Korea operates a global network of IT workers, both as individuals and under front companies, to evade sanctions and generate revenue for the regime.

These entities helped DPRK workers launder earnings through online payment services and Chinese bank accounts. The payments, often routed through cryptocurrencies or shadow banking systems, ultimately support state programs, including weapons development, circumventing international sanctions.</p>\n<p>These schemes present significant risks to employers, including potential legal violations, reputational damage, and insider threats such as intellectual property theft or malware implantation.

Owing to increased data protection measures by the PRC, a complete accounting of Tong Yuze’s companies is not possible.</p>\n<p>Some companies identified as Tong Yuze’s include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>海口宜路畅佟科技贸易有限公司</li>\n<li>北京上日清新食品有限公司</li>\n<li>京山味诚（北京）餐饮管理有限公司</li>\n<li>泽日启程（北京）餐饮管理有限公司</li>\n<li>北京哈巴萨科贸有限公司</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This foray into restaurants does not appear to be a case of mistaken identity. The email provided for Tong Yuze on the registration of Beijing Xiwang Technology Company is <code>tongyuze@jswc[.]com[.]cn</code>. The email domain “JSWC” aligns with the name of some of Tong Yuze’s restaurant companies. In this case, Jing Shan Wei Cheng (京山味诚), matches the acronym of the email domain.

By impersonating legitimate U.S.-based software and technology consulting firms, North Korean actors aim to gain trust and access to sensitive contracts, circumventing sanctions and evading detection. These tactics highlight a deliberate and evolving strategy that leverages the global digital economy to fund state activities, including weapons development.</p>\n<p>Our research not only exposes the deceptive tactics employed by DPRK IT workers but also connects these efforts to a broader, active network of front companies originating in China. This linkage emphasizes the scale and complexity of North Korea’s financial schemes and the importance of vigilance across industries. Organizations are urged to implement robust vetting processes, including careful scrutiny of potential contractors and suppliers, to mitigate risks and prevent inadvertent support of such illicit operations. By shedding light on these activities, SentinelLabs aims to equip businesses, governments, and the public with the insights needed to stay ahead of these threats and safeguard the integrity of global markets.</p>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"Executive Summary\nSentinelLabs has identified unique characteristics of multiple websites, now seized by the US Government, associated with the DPRK IT Worker front companies.\nWe assess with high confidence that DPRK actors seek to impersonate US based software and technology consulting businesses by copying the online brands of legitimate organizations, seeking to use these for financial objectives.\nSentinelLabs has linked the activity to several active front companies and links these with high confidence to a larger set of organizations being created in China.\nOur findings link additional companies, which remain active today, to the DPRK IT Workers scheme.\nBackground\nNorth Korea operates a global network of IT workers, both as individuals and under front companies, to evade sanctions and generate revenue for the regime. These workers are highly skilled in areas like software development, mobile applications, blockchain, and cryptocurrency technologies. By posing as professionals from other countries using fake identities and forged credentials, they secure remote jobs and freelance contracts with businesses worldwide.\nOur PinnacleOne team has compiled an executive summary of this threat, available here.\nFront companies, often based in China, Russia, Southeast Asia, and Africa, play a key role in masking the workers’ true origins and managing payments. Notable examples include China-based Yanbian Silverstar Network Technology Co. Ltd., disrupted in October 2023, and Russia-based Volasys Silver Star, sanctioned by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2018, for their roles in facilitating fraudulent IT operations. These entities helped DPRK workers launder earnings through online payment services and Chinese bank accounts. The payments, often routed through cryptocurrencies or shadow banking systems, ultimately support state programs, including weapons development, circumventing international sanctions.\nThese schemes present significant risks to employers, including potential legal violations, reputational damage, and insider threats such as intellectual property theft or malware implantation. Addressing these risks requires heightened awareness and stringent vetting processes to limit North Korea’s ability to exploit global tech markets.\nThis blog explores four newly identified examples of DPRK IT Worker front companies, analyzing their online presence and the methods they use to appear legitimate to unsuspecting targets in recent months. These four companies’ websites were recently subject to law enforcement action and taken offline.\nIndependent Lab LLC\nThe Independent Lab LLC website, inditechlab[.]com was active since at least February 2024, with indication it was acquired and operated using InterServer hosting since May 2022 (174.138.181[.]198). The domain itself was registered through NameCheap.\nThe content of the website is in line with what you would expect of a legitimate software development outsourcing business, with no obvious major indicators associated with the DPRK, or even illegitimate in any way. In the case of Independent Lab LLC, the website format and content was copied from Kitrum, a legitimate custom software firm headquartered in the United States. The DPRK actors did not retain the “We Stand with Ukraine” link or menu header.\nDPRK IT Worker Front Company Website – Independent Lab LLChot\nLegitimate business, source of copied website design used by DPRK\nThe content of the website centered around the Contact Us form, enticing visitors to engage in communications, providing no contact details on the website itself.\nShenyang Tonywang Technology LTD\nThe name “Shenyang Tonywang Technology” was used in the formal content of the website; however, the domain itself is tonywangtech[.]com. The website first became active in November 2023, overlapping with previously used InterServer hosting infrastructure (174.138.181[.]198), and was also registered via NameCheap.\nSimilar to the previous example, Shenyang Tonywang Technology advertises itself as a top software consulting company with bespoke solutions, including DevOps & cloud consulting. In this case, the website format and content was copied from Urolime, a legitimate DevOps consulting company headquartered in the United States.\nDPRK IT Worker Front Company Website – Shenyang Tonywang Technology LTD\nLegitimate Urolime business, source of copied website design used by DPRK\nTony WKJ LLC\nTony WKJ LLC IT Services website, wkjllc[.]com, was active since at least May 2024, with indication it was acquired and operated using InterServer hosting (174.138.181[.]198) since May 2022. The domain itself was registered through NameCheap.\nTony WKJ LLC advertises itself as a leading software development company that specializes in Agile IT development. Once again, In this case the website format and content was copied from a legitimate business. Specifically, this website is a copy from  ArohaTech IT Services, a software and web development company headquartered in Noida, India.\nHowever, a comparison to the legitimate website reveals that the DPRK actors have not only placed their own name, and removed original ArohaTech logos, they have also modified the content to clearly attempt to brand Tony WKJ LLC as a US based company.\nDPRK IT Worker Front Company Website – Tony WKJ LLC\nLegitimate business, source of copied website design used by DPRK\nHopanaTech\nHopanaTech website, hopanatech[.]com is a bit more unique from the others above. The domain itself was first registered in November 2020, and began hosting publicly via Asia Web Services Ltd (180.235.135[.]177) in December 2020. The website has been presented as shown below since at least the end of 2021. The domain was registered through NameCheap.\nThe website content aligns with the previous examples, including the description of being a custom software development company. The HopanaTech version of the content has been modified significantly; however, it continued to make use of customer reviews and marketing content from legitimate public websites. However, in some cases, content that would have required more than a simple text edit remains unchanged, showing the original sources name, such as the legitimate ITechArt firm’s website.\nDPRK IT Worker Front Company Website – HopanaTech\nDPRK IT Worker Front Company Website – HopanaTech – Showing content source\nUnited States Government Response\nEach of the above four companies has been disrupted by US Government agencies, specifically the Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Homeland Security Investigations, Defense Criminal Investigative Service, and the United States Postal Inspection Service.\nOn October 10th, the US Government seized the four domains belonging to the front companies, each of which now shows the standard takedown alert and links to the 2022 US Treasury fact sheet on DPRKs IT Worker scheme. The websites rotate between English and Korean language versions.\nDomain Seized Alert – English\nDomain Seized Alert – Korean\nExpanded Analysis\nDrawing on details from the four companies disrupted by US Government agencies, SentinelLabs was able to find multiple leads to an active network of DPRK IT front companies originating in China.\nThe Mysterious A1 Building\nIn an early 2024 archived snapshot of Shenyang Tonywang Technology’s website, tonywangtech[.]com, we can see the actor added the following address:\nNo. 1006-25, Building A1, No. 11, Tawan Street, Huanggu District, Shenyang City Liaoning 110036\ntonywangtech[.]com listed address and contact detailsWe identified an additional company with similar traits. First, the address happens to be highly close in proximity – listed next to each other on the same floor of the same building. No. 1006-23, Building A1, No. 11, Tawan Street, Huanggu, Shenyang, Liaoning, China\nThe additional company is Shenyang Huguo Technology Ltd, which uses the domain huguotechltd[.]com in a similar way to the previous four. The website uses copied content and logos from the legitimate Indian software firm TatvaSoft.\nActive DPRK linked company website -Shenyang Huguo Technology Ltd\nThe huguotechltd[.]com domain was registered in October 2023 via NameCheap. The domain has since been and continues to be hosted at 103.15.29[.]44, of Asia Web Services Ltd.\nWe assess Shenyang Huguo Technology Ltd. is closely associated with the previously four reviewed DPRK IT Worker front companies, and had remained online long enough to have been used to achieve the DPRKs objectives.\nThe Tony Wang Link\nHopanaTech’s website, hopanatech[.]com, listed three contacts before it was taken down by law enforcement. The first person, Wang Kejia, is listed with the email address “Tonywkj”.\nContacts from the now-seized HopanaTech website\nThe “wkj” is almost certainly the acronym for the preceding Chinese name, Wang Kejia. The Tonywkj@Hopana email address establishes a link between Wang Kejia, a real person who is a resident of the address in New Jersey and the “Tony Wang” identity. The Shenyang Tonywang Technology Company website discussed above was also subject to law enforcement action, and its name bears resemblance to the same Tongwkj listed by Hopana. Furthermore, the Tonywkj email also directly matches the domain of another taken-down DPRK IT Worker site discussed above, Tony WKJ LLC.\nThe Tong Yuze Identity\nLaw enforcement action established that Hopana Tech and Hopanatech[.]com are DRPK IT Worker Front companies. This analysis expands on the Hopana Tech company corporate registration data inside China.\nA corporate records website from the PRC indicates the Beijing Xiwang Technology Company (北京市戏网科技有限公司), previously used the name Beijing Hou Pa Na Technology Company (北京后帕纳科技有限公司), a clear cognate for the English-translated “HopanaTech.”\nCorporate record showing Xiwang’s previous use of the Hopana Technology name\nFurthermore, the above screenshot of HopanaTech’s website, which lists the Tonywkj email address, also lists Tong Yuze (佟雨泽). The same name is used for the corporate registrant of Beijing Xiwang Technology Company.Highlighted text shows that Beijing Xiwang Technology was previously known as Hopana Tech.\nContacts from the now-seized HopanaTech website\nAs if to allay concerns that Beijing Xiwang Technology Company was not a front company, corporate records show the firm only pays unemployment insurance, health insurance, and employee injury liability insurance for one person.\nCorporate records for Bejing Xiwang Technology Company\nTong Yuze is currently listed as the corporate registrant of 25 companies in China, including many restaurants and catering companies. Owing to increased data protection measures by the PRC, a complete accounting of Tong Yuze’s companies is not possible.\nSome companies identified as Tong Yuze’s include:\n海口宜路畅佟科技贸易有限公司\n北京上日清新食品有限公司\n京山味诚（北京）餐饮管理有限公司\n泽日启程（北京）餐饮管理有限公司\n北京哈巴萨科贸有限公司\nThis foray into restaurants does not appear to be a case of mistaken identity. The email provided for Tong Yuze on the registration of Beijing Xiwang Technology Company is tongyuze@jswc[.]com[.]cn. The email domain “JSWC” aligns with the name of some of Tong Yuze’s restaurant companies. In this case, Jing Shan Wei Cheng (京山味诚), matches the acronym of the email domain. This provides reasonable evidence of a legitimate connection between Tong Yuze and the mentioned food service companies.\nGiven the very real businesses being run by Tong Yuze’s other corporate registrations– seemingly many franchises of Yiwei Yicheng (一味一诚) –it’s possible this individual is serving as a cut-out for the DPRK. We hypothesize that his collection of businesses may serve to provide cover for illegal ones.\nThe Haikou Yilu Changtong Technology Trading Company\nOne of the companies connected to the Tong Yuze identity and accessible on corporate registration sites is Haikou Yilu Changtong Technology Trading Company (海口宜路畅佟科技贸易有限公司).\nHaikou Yilu Changtong Technology Trading Company corporate registration\nHaikou Yilu is distinct from the other Tong Yuze-registered companies for two reasons. First, it is another technology company–not a restaurant. Second, its corporate registration makes use of a telephone number that differs from Tong Yuze’s restaurant businesses but is shared with the Beijing Xiwang Technology Company corporate registration.\nTo help visualize the connections we described, the graphic below provides a simplified representation of the key relationships and pivots.\nVisual representation of front company connections\nConclusion\nThe DPRK’s use of the IT Worker scheme underscores the regime’s adaptability in exploiting global markets to further its financial objectives. By impersonating legitimate U.S.-based software and technology consulting firms, North Korean actors aim to gain trust and access to sensitive contracts, circumventing sanctions and evading detection. These tactics highlight a deliberate and evolving strategy that leverages the global digital economy to fund state activities, including weapons development.\nOur research not only exposes the deceptive tactics employed by DPRK IT workers but also connects these efforts to a broader, active network of front companies originating in China. This linkage emphasizes the scale and complexity of North Korea’s financial schemes and the importance of vigilance across industries. Organizations are urged to implement robust vetting processes, including careful scrutiny of potential contractors and suppliers, to mitigate risks and prevent inadvertent support of such illicit operations. By shedding light on these activities, SentinelLabs aims to equip businesses, governments, and the public with the insights needed to stay ahead of these threats and safeguard the integrity of global markets.","enclosure":{"url":"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DPRK-Front-v3-ftr.jpg","length":"503118","type":"image/jpeg"},"dc:creator":"Tom Hegel &amp; Dakota Cary","content":"SentinelLabs has identified multiple deceptive websites linked to businesses in China fronting for North Korea's fake IT workers scheme.","contentSnippet":"SentinelLabs has identified multiple deceptive websites linked to businesses in China fronting for North Korea's fake IT workers scheme.","guid":"https://www.sentinelone.com/?post_type=labs&p=109228","categories":["China","DPRK"],"isoDate":"2024-11-21T10:55:47.000Z","tag":"intel"},{"creator":"Raffaele Sabato, Phil Stokes &amp; Tom Hegel","title":"BlueNoroff Hidden Risk | Threat Actor Targets Macs with Fake Crypto News and Novel Persistence","link":"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/bluenoroff-hidden-risk-threat-actor-targets-macs-with-fake-crypto-news-and-novel-persistence/","pubDate":"Thu, 07 Nov 2024 10:55:47 +0000","content:encoded":"<h2>Executive Summary</h2>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">SentinelLabs has observed a suspected DPRK threat actor targeting Crypto-related businesses with novel multi-stage malware.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">We assess with high confidence that the same actor is responsible for earlier attacks attributed to BlueNoroff and the RustDoor/ThiefBucket and RustBucket campaigns.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">SentinelLabs observed the use of a novel persistence mechanism abusing the Zsh configuration file <code>zshenv</code>.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The campaign, which we dubbed ‘Hidden Risk’, uses emails propagating fake news about cryptocurrency trends to infect targets via a malicious application disguised as a PDF file.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Cryptocurrency-related businesses have been targets of North Korean-affiliated threat actors for some time now, with multiple campaigns aiming to steal funds and/or insert backdoor malware into targets. In April 2023, <a href=\"https://www.jamf.com/blog/bluenoroff-apt-targets-macos-rustbucket-malware/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">researchers</a> detailed an APT campaign targeting macOS users with multi-stage malware that culminated in a Rust backdoor capable of downloading and executing further malware on infected devices. ‘RustBucket’, as they labeled it, was attributed with strong confidence to the BlueNoroff APT. In May 2023, ESET researchers discovered a second RustBucket variant targeting macOS users, followed by Elastic’s <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/security-labs/DPRK-strikes-using-a-new-variant-of-rustbucket\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">discovery</a> in July that year of a third variant that included a LaunchAgent for persistence. In November 2023, Elastic also <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/security-labs/elastic-catches-dprk-passing-out-kandykorn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reported</a> on another DPRK campaign targeting blockchain engineers of a crypto exchange platform with KandyKorn malware. Further analysis by SentinelLabs was able to <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/dprk-crypto-theft-macos-rustbucket-droppers-pivot-to-deliver-kandykorn-payloads/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">connect</a> the KandyKorn and RustBucket campaigns.</p>\n<p>In early September 2024, the FBI began <a href=\"https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2024/PSA240903\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">warning</a> that North Korea was conducting “highly tailored, difficult-to-detect social engineering campaigns against employees of decentralized finance (&#8220;DeFi&#8221;), cryptocurrency, and similar businesses to deploy malware and steal company cryptocurrency”. Researchers from <a href=\"https://www.jamf.com/blog/jamf-threat-labs-observes-targeted-attacks-amid-fbi-warnings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jamf</a> subsequently followed up on this report a few weeks later detailing an attack attempt that deployed malware masquerading as a Visual Studio updater.</p>\n<p>In October 2024, SentinelLabs observed a phishing attempt on a crypto-related industry that delivered a dropper application and a payload bearing many of the hallmarks of these previous attacks. We believe the campaign likely began as early as July 2024 and uses email and PDF lures with fake news headlines or stories about crypto-related topics. We dubbed this campaign ‘Hidden Risk’ and detail its operation and indicators of compromise below, including the use of a novel persistence mechanism abusing the zshenv configuration file.</p>\n<h2>Infection Vector</h2>\n<p>Initial infection is achieved via phishing email containing a link to a malicious application. The application is disguised as a link to a PDF document relating to a cryptocurrency topic such as “Hidden Risk Behind New Surge of Bitcoin Price”, “Altcoin Season 2.0-The Hidden Gems to Watch” and “New Era for Stablecoins and DeFi, CeFi”.</p>\n<p>The emails hijack the name of a real person in an unrelated industry as a sender and purport to be forwarding a message from a well-known crypto social media influencer. In the case of the ‘Hidden Risk’ pdf, the threat actors copied a <a href=\"https://ijsra.net/sites/default/files/IJSRA-2024-1296.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">genuine research paper</a> entitled ‘Bitcoin ETF: Opportunities and risk’ by an academic associated with the University of Texas and hosted online by the International Journal of Science and Research Archive (IJSRA).</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_108341\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-108341\" style=\"width: 1789px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-108341\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BNThief_4.jpg\" alt=\"The fake PDF displayed to targets (left) and the original source document hosted online (right)\" width=\"1789\" height=\"614\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BNThief_4.jpg 1789w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BNThief_4-300x103.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BNThief_4-1024x351.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BNThief_4-768x264.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BNThief_4-1536x527.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1789px) 100vw, 1789px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-108341\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The fake PDF displayed to targets (left) and the original source document hosted online (right)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Unlike earlier campaigns attributed to BlueNoroff, the Hidden Risk campaign uses an unsophisticated phishing email that does not engage the recipient with contextually-relevant content, such as reference to personal or work-related information.</p>\n<p>Also of note is that the sender domain in our observed incident, <code>kalpadvisory[.]com</code>, has been <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1c3rema/incessant_spam_calls_from_kalp_advisory_and_others/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">noted</a> for spamming among online communities involved in the Indian stock market.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_108336\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-108336\" style=\"width: 1574px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-108336\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BNThief_9.jpg\" alt=\"Social media users complain about spam calls from Kalp Advisory\" width=\"1574\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BNThief_9.jpg 1574w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BNThief_9-300x195.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BNThief_9-1024x666.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BNThief_9-768x500.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BNThief_9-1536x999.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1574px) 100vw, 1574px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-108336\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Social media users complain about spam calls from Kalp Advisory</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The ‘open’ link in the phishing email hides a URL to another domain, <code>delphidigital[.]org</code>.

At the user level, it sits as a hidden file in the Home directory, <code>~/.zshenv</code>. A system wide version can also be located at <code>/etc/zshenv</code>. If it exists, the file is sourced for all Zsh sessions, including interactive and non-interactive shells, non-login shells and scripts. It is also read before all other Zsh startup files.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, previous malware samples used by the same threat actor have referenced <a href=\"https://www.jamf.com/blog/jamf-threat-labs-observes-targeted-attacks-amid-fbi-warnings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">zsh_env</a> in their naming convention, but not actually used the mechanism. In an <a href=\"https://www.jamf.com/blog/jamf-threat-labs-observes-targeted-attacks-amid-fbi-warnings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">earlier campaign</a>, BlueNoroff used the <code>~/.zshrc</code> config file to achieve persistence. However, this is a less reliable form of persistence since the file is only sourced when a user launches an interactive Terminal session or subsession from an existing console.</p>\n<p>Infecting the host with a malicious Zshenv file allows for a more powerful form of persistence. While this technique is not unknown, it is the first time we have observed it used in the wild by malware authors. It has particular value on modern versions of macOS since Apple <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/apples-macos-ventura-7-new-security-changes-to-be-aware-of/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">introduced user notifications</a> for background Login Items as of macOS 13 Ventura. Apple’s notification aims to warn users when a persistence method is installed, particularly oft-abused LaunchAgents and LaunchDaemons. Abusing Zshenv, however, does not trigger such a notification in current versions of macOS.</p>\n<p>In the binary, installation of the persistence mechanism is handled by the <code>sym.install_char__char_</code> function. The mechanism checks for a hidden touch file (zero byte) in the <code>/tmp/</code> folder called <code>.zsh_init_success</code>. If the file does not exist, then the &#8216;growth&#8217; binary is called and the touch file is created.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_108343\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-108343\" style=\"width: 1195px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-108343\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BNThief_16.jpg\" alt=\"Contents of the malicious ~/.zshenv, executed for every Zsh session\" width=\"1195\" height=\"281\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BNThief_16.jpg 1195w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BNThief_16-300x71.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BNThief_16-1024x241.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BNThief_16-768x181.jpg 768w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BNThief_16-221x51.jpg 221w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1195px) 100vw, 1195px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-108343\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Contents of the malicious <em>~/.zshenv</em>, executed for every Zsh session</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Network Infrastructure</h2>\n<p>Analysis of the actor operated and controlled network infrastructure associated with the Hidden Risk campaign further corroborates our confidence in attribution to DPRK’s BlueNoroff threat actor. Additionally, infrastructure analysis provides new insight into an extensive cluster of activity over the last year plus, and provides further links to industry reporting mentioned above, and <a href=\"https://x.com/500mk500/status/1826552762995187893\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">others in the community</a>.</p>\n<p>Over recent months, the actor has built a network of connected infrastructure often themed around their cryptocurrency interests, methods of delivering malware lures, and mimicking legitimate Web3, cryptocurrency, fintech, and investment organizations to appear legitimate. NameCheap is the predominant domain registrar being abused. Virtual server hosting services such as Quickpacket, Routerhosting, Hostwinds, and others are the most commonly used based on our observations.</p>\n<p>Various methods of pivoting across network infrastructures and services can be used to connect the Hidden Risk campaign to domains themed around the following organizations, indicating the actors interest in potential targeting and spoofing for targeting on other organizations.</p>\n<div style=\"overflow-x: auto;\">\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 120px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 24px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 50.0%; height: 24px;\">Cryptocurrency Technologies</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.0%; height: 24px;\">Delphi Digital, Solana Labs, Douro Labs, bitsCrunch, Caladan</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 24px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 50.0%; height: 24px;\">Investment and Capital Entities</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.0%; height: 24px;\">Maelstrom Fund, Selini Capital, Flori Ventures, ARK Invest, Long Journey Ventures</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 24px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 50.0%; height: 24px;\">Generic IT/Communication</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.0%; height: 24px;\">Virtual Meetings (Zoom, generic), Software Updates (macOS, browsers, generic)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>When examining the infrastructure of the campaign detailed above in infrastructure analysis tools such as Validin, we can identify clear relations between the initial stage 1 delivery domain (<code>matuaner[.]com</code>) and the IPs <code>45.61.135[.]105</code> and <code>172.86.108[.]47</code>.

As with all quality threat intelligence, our goal is to aid defenders while carefully managing the exposure of our tracking techniques to the actor. However, we are sharing a broader set of associated infrastructure in the Indicator of Compromise section below.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Over the last 12 months or so, North Korean cyber actors have engaged in a series of campaigns against crypto-related industries, many of which involved extensive &#8216;grooming&#8217; of targets via social media. We observe that the Hidden Risk campaign diverts from this strategy taking a more traditional and cruder, though not necessarily any less effective, email phishing approach. Despite the bluntness of the initial infection method, other hallmarks of previous DPRK-backed campaigns are evident, both in terms of observed malware artifacts and associated network infrastructure, as discussed extensively throughout this post.</p>\n<p>We might speculate that heightened attention on previous DRPK campaigns could have reduced the effectiveness of previous &#8216;social media grooming&#8217; attempts, perhaps as a result of intended targets in DeFi, ETF and other crypto-related industries becoming more wary, but it is equally likely that such state-backed threat actors have sufficient resources to pursue multiple strategies simultaneously.</p>\n<p>One factor that is relatively consistent throughout many of these campaigns is that the threat actors are seemingly able to acquire or hijack valid Apple &#8216;identified developer&#8217; accounts at will, have their malware notarized by Apple, and bypass macOS Gatekeeper and other built-in Apple security technologies. In light of this and the general increase in macOS crimeware observed across the security industry, we encourage all macOS users, but particularly those in organizational settings, to harden their security and increase their awareness of potential risks.</p>\n<h2>Indicators of Compromise</h2>\n<div style=\"font-size: 0.8em;\">\n<div style=\"overflow-x: auto;\">\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

In April 2023, researchers detailed an APT campaign targeting macOS users with multi-stage malware that culminated in a Rust backdoor capable of downloading and executing further malware on infected devices. ‘RustBucket’, as they labeled it, was attributed with strong confidence to the BlueNoroff APT. In May 2023, ESET researchers discovered a second RustBucket variant targeting macOS users, followed by Elastic’s discovery in July that year of a third variant that included a LaunchAgent for persistence. In November 2023, Elastic also reported on another DPRK campaign targeting blockchain engineers of a crypto exchange platform with KandyKorn malware. Further analysis by SentinelLabs was able to connect the KandyKorn and RustBucket campaigns.\nIn early September 2024, the FBI began warning that North Korea was conducting “highly tailored, difficult-to-detect social engineering campaigns against employees of decentralized finance (“DeFi”), cryptocurrency, and similar businesses to deploy malware and steal company cryptocurrency”. Researchers from Jamf subsequently followed up on this report a few weeks later detailing an attack attempt that deployed malware masquerading as a Visual Studio updater.\nIn October 2024, SentinelLabs observed a phishing attempt on a crypto-related industry that delivered a dropper application and a payload bearing many of the hallmarks of these previous attacks. We believe the campaign likely began as early as July 2024 and uses email and PDF lures with fake news headlines or stories about crypto-related topics. We dubbed this campaign ‘Hidden Risk’ and detail its operation and indicators of compromise below, including the use of a novel persistence mechanism abusing the zshenv configuration file.\nInfection Vector\nInitial infection is achieved via phishing email containing a link to a malicious application. The application is disguised as a link to a PDF document relating to a cryptocurrency topic such as “Hidden Risk Behind New Surge of Bitcoin Price”, “Altcoin Season 2.0-The Hidden Gems to Watch” and “New Era for Stablecoins and DeFi, CeFi”.\nThe emails hijack the name of a real person in an unrelated industry as a sender and purport to be forwarding a message from a well-known crypto social media influencer. In the case of the ‘Hidden Risk’ pdf, the threat actors copied a genuine research paper entitled ‘Bitcoin ETF: Opportunities and risk’ by an academic associated with the University of Texas and hosted online by the International Journal of Science and Research Archive (IJSRA).\nThe fake PDF displayed to targets (left) and the original source document hosted online (right)\nUnlike earlier campaigns attributed to BlueNoroff, the Hidden Risk campaign uses an unsophisticated phishing email that does not engage the recipient with contextually-relevant content, such as reference to personal or work-related information.\nAlso of note is that the sender domain in our observed incident, kalpadvisory[.]com, has been noted for spamming among online communities involved in the Indian stock market.\nSocial media users complain about spam calls from Kalp Advisory\nThe ‘open’ link in the phishing email hides a URL to another domain, delphidigital[.]org. The full URL currently serves a benign form of the Bitcoin ETF document with titles that differ over time. However, at some point, this URL has or does switch to serving the first stage of a malicious application bundle entitled ‘Hidden Risk Behind New Surge of Bitcoin Price.app’ (3f17c5a7d1e7fd138163d8039e614b8a967a56cb).\nApplication icon for the Stage 1 dropper\nFirst Stage | “Bait and Switch” Dropper Application Replaces PDF\nThe first stage is a Mac application written in Swift displaying the same name as the expected PDF, “Hidden Risk Behind New Surge of Bitcoin Price.app”. The application bundle has the bundle identifier Education.LessonOne and contains a universal architecture (i.e., arm64 and x86-64) Mach-O executable named LessonOne.\nThe application bundle was signed and notarized on 19 October, 2024 with the Apple Developer ID “Avantis Regtech Private Limited (2S8XHJ7948)”. The signature has since been revoked by Apple.\nCode signing details for the Hidden Risk Behind New Surge of Bitcoin Price.app\nOn launch, the application downloads the decoy “Hidden Risk” pdf file from a Google Drive share and opens it using the default macOS PDF viewer (typically Preview). Similar TTPs were previously reported by researchers at Kandji in August. The PDF is written into a temporary file before being moved to /Users/Shared using NSFileManager’s moveItemAtURL:toURL:error method.\nThe malware then downloads and executes a malicious x86-64 binary sourced from matuaner[.]com via a URL hard-coded into the Stage 1 binary. Since by default macOS won’t allow an application to download from an insecure HTTP protocol, the application’s Info.plist specifies this domain in the dictionary for its NSAppTransportSecurity key and sets the NSExceptionAllowsInsecureHTTPLoads value to “true”.\nThe Stage 1’s Info.plist adds the C2 domain as an exception for Apple’s App Transport Security settings\nThe Info.plist also indicates that the application was built on a macOS 14.2 Sonoma machine but will run on both Intel and Apple silicon Macs with macOS 12 Monterey or later.\nSecond Stage | ‘growth’ x86-64 Mach-O Backdoor\nThe malicious binary downloaded by the first stage dropper is a single architecture Mach-O x86-64 executable (7e07765bf8ee2d0b2233039623016d6dfb610a6d), meaning that although the parent dropper will execute on both Intel and Apple silicon machines, the Stage 2 will only run on Intel architecture Macs or Apple silicon devices with the Rosetta emulation framework installed. The binary, written in C++, has the name ‘growth’, weighs in at around 5.1 MB and is not code signed at all (SentinelLabs was able to share the file for researchers here).\nThe executable contains a number of identifiable functions, which we outline below, with the overall objective being to act as a backdoor to execute remote commands.\nSome interesting functions in the ‘growth’ binary\nOn execution, the ‘growth’ binary performs the following actions.\nCalls the sym.install_char__char_ function to install persistence. We discuss this in the next section.\nRuns several commands to gather environmental information from the host and generate a random UUID of length 16. These commands include sw_vers ProductVersion, sysctl hw.model and sysctl kern.boottime.\nCalculates the current date and time and performs ps aux to list running processes.\nSends the string “ci”, the random UUID and the gathered host data to a remote server using the DoPost function and awaits the C2 response.\nUses the ProcessRequest function to parse the response. If the first byte in the response is 0x31, it sends the string “cs”, the random UUID and the value -1 using DoPost and exits. If the first byte in the response is 0x30, it executes the SaveAndExec function, sends the string “cs”, the random UUID and the value 0 using DoPost. The SaveAndExec function reads the C2 response, parses it, saves it into a random, hidden file at /Users/Shared/.XXXXXX, and executes it.\nThe ProcessRequest function parses the C2 response\nSleeps for 60 seconds and starts the flow again from step 3.\nThe DoPost function is used to make the HTTP Post request to the C2 using libcurl. The first argument is the C2 URL, the second argument is the data sent in the body of the POST request, and the third argument is the data pointer passed to the write callback.\nThe DoPost function constructs and sends the HTTP request\nWe have previously noted that this same User-Agent string, mozilla/4.0 (compatible; msie 8.0; windows nt 5.1; trident/4.0), appeared in RustBucket malware in 2023. The User-Agent string also uses cur1-agent (using a 1 in place of the l in “curl”) as reported by Elastic, a fairly unique indicator we have not observed elsewhere.\nWe also see similarities in the way that earlier malware parsed the response from the C2, essentially comparing one of two values as decision logic between awaiting further response, exiting or reading and writing a remote command to file. The ProcessRequest function used for this purpose was also the name of an ObjCShellz payload observed in a previous campaign.\nThe SaveAndExec function is responsible for executing any commands received from the C2. This function takes two parameters, the payload received and the length of the payload. The function parses the malicious payload and calculates indices related to the presence of the characters “#” and the “:”, receiving data from the C2 in the form 0#\\0:command.\nSaveAndExec function parses the received script for embedded commands\nBased on the calculated indices, it creates a random file name of length 6 and writes the received command as a hidden file to /Users/Shared/.%s. It then uses chmod 0x777 to set the permissions of the file to world read, write and execute, and finally executes it via popen.\nThe SaveAndExec function changes the file’s permissions and then executes it\nPersistence via Zshenv\nThe backdoor’s operation is functionally similar to previous malware attributed to this threat actor, but what makes it especially interesting is the persistence mechanism, which abuses the Zshenv configuration file.\nZshenv is one of several optional configuration files used by the Zsh shell. At the user level, it sits as a hidden file in the Home directory, ~/.zshenv. A system wide version can also be located at /etc/zshenv. If it exists, the file is sourced for all Zsh sessions, including interactive and non-interactive shells, non-login shells and scripts. It is also read before all other Zsh startup files.\nInterestingly, previous malware samples used by the same threat actor have referenced zsh_env in their naming convention, but not actually used the mechanism. In an earlier campaign, BlueNoroff used the ~/.zshrc config file to achieve persistence. However, this is a less reliable form of persistence since the file is only sourced when a user launches an interactive Terminal session or subsession from an existing console.\nInfecting the host with a malicious Zshenv file allows for a more powerful form of persistence. While this technique is not unknown, it is the first time we have observed it used in the wild by malware authors. It has particular value on modern versions of macOS since Apple introduced user notifications for background Login Items as of macOS 13 Ventura. Apple’s notification aims to warn users when a persistence method is installed, particularly oft-abused LaunchAgents and LaunchDaemons. Abusing Zshenv, however, does not trigger such a notification in current versions of macOS.\nIn the binary, installation of the persistence mechanism is handled by the sym.install_char__char_ function. The mechanism checks for a hidden touch file (zero byte) in the /tmp/ folder called .zsh_init_success. If the file does not exist, then the ‘growth’ binary is called and the touch file is created.\nContents of the malicious ~/.zshenv, executed for every Zsh session\nNetwork Infrastructure\nAnalysis of the actor operated and controlled network infrastructure associated with the Hidden Risk campaign further corroborates our confidence in attribution to DPRK’s BlueNoroff threat actor. Additionally, infrastructure analysis provides new insight into an extensive cluster of activity over the last year plus, and provides further links to industry reporting mentioned above, and others in the community.\nOver recent months, the actor has built a network of connected infrastructure often themed around their cryptocurrency interests, methods of delivering malware lures, and mimicking legitimate Web3, cryptocurrency, fintech, and investment organizations to appear legitimate. NameCheap is the predominant domain registrar being abused. Virtual server hosting services such as Quickpacket, Routerhosting, Hostwinds, and others are the most commonly used based on our observations.\nVarious methods of pivoting across network infrastructures and services can be used to connect the Hidden Risk campaign to domains themed around the following organizations, indicating the actors interest in potential targeting and spoofing for targeting on other organizations.\nCryptocurrency Technologies\nDelphi Digital, Solana Labs, Douro Labs, bitsCrunch, Caladan\n\n\nInvestment and Capital Entities\nMaelstrom Fund, Selini Capital, Flori Ventures, ARK Invest, Long Journey Ventures\n\n\nGeneric IT/Communication\nVirtual Meetings (Zoom, generic), Software Updates (macOS, browsers, generic)\n\n\n\n\nWhen examining the infrastructure of the campaign detailed above in infrastructure analysis tools such as Validin, we can identify clear relations between the initial stage 1 delivery domain (matuaner[.]com) and the IPs 45.61.135[.]105 and 172.86.108[.]47. These two IPs, in combination with an overlapping certificate use, link to a variety of domains that open the door to the larger and longer running history of BlueNoroff activity (green lines), and additional lesser confidence infrastructure to explore further (orange dotted lines).\nPivoting from sample delivery to initial set of infrastructure\nAdditional valuable pivoting can be achieved by analyzing attributes like DNS TXT records linked to domains that the actor may be using for phishing email delivery. For instance, we’ve observed the actor abusing email marketing automation tools, such as Brevo, where they go so far as to verify domain ownership to meet email authentication standards—an effort to bypass spam and phishing detection filters.\nPivoting initial infrastructure to wider set, though DNS TXT Records\nBeyond direct pivoting based on infrastructure and overlapping response data, we also identified additional domains registered using similar methods that reflect previous organization naming themes across various top level domains (TLDs), though these domains have not yet been linked to any known actor activity. For instance, by analyzing bulk domain search datasets, we found related but non-pivotable domains based on “Selini Capital,” such as selinicapital[.]network. This approach has proven effective in uncovering additional BlueNoroff domains linked to the Hidden Risk activity cluster.\nExample Regular Expression: /s+e+l+i+n+i+c+a+p+i+t+a+l+\\.[a-z0-9-]+/\nBulk domain scanning, past 180 days, showing registration summary\nThe extensive collection of BlueNoroff infrastructure we’ve gathered over the years, recently expanded through the latest Hidden Risk campaign activity, prevents us from detailing every unique pivoting method as this actor continues to evolve. As with all quality threat intelligence, our goal is to aid defenders while carefully managing the exposure of our tracking techniques to the actor. However, we are sharing a broader set of associated infrastructure in the Indicator of Compromise section below.\nConclusion\nOver the last 12 months or so, North Korean cyber actors have engaged in a series of campaigns against crypto-related industries, many of which involved extensive ‘grooming’ of targets via social media. We observe that the Hidden Risk campaign diverts from this strategy taking a more traditional and cruder, though not necessarily any less effective, email phishing approach. Despite the bluntness of the initial infection method, other hallmarks of previous DPRK-backed campaigns are evident, both in terms of observed malware artifacts and associated network infrastructure, as discussed extensively throughout this post.\nWe might speculate that heightened attention on previous DRPK campaigns could have reduced the effectiveness of previous ‘social media grooming’ attempts, perhaps as a result of intended targets in DeFi, ETF and other crypto-related industries becoming more wary, but it is equally likely that such state-backed threat actors have sufficient resources to pursue multiple strategies simultaneously.\nOne factor that is relatively consistent throughout many of these campaigns is that the threat actors are seemingly able to acquire or hijack valid Apple ‘identified developer’ accounts at will, have their malware notarized by Apple, and bypass macOS Gatekeeper and other built-in Apple security technologies. In light of this and the general increase in macOS crimeware observed across the security industry, we encourage all macOS users, but particularly those in organizational settings, to harden their security and increase their awareness of potential risks.\nIndicators of Compromise\nSHA1\nFunction\nFile\nArch\n\n\n05c178891ca1e65af53bbcfdbec573da3f74d176\nDropper\nMacho\narm64\n\n\n3f17c5a7d1e7fd138163d8039e614b8a967a56cb\nDropper\nApp\nUniversal\n\n\n7e07765bf8ee2d0b2233039623016d6dfb610a6d\nBackdoor\nMacho\nx86_64\n\n\nbaf4da6b89b7d7cbf24c9deef5984ef9dfd52e6a\nDropper\nMacho\nUniversal\n\n\ne5d97afa5f1501b3d5ec1a471dc8a3b8e2a84fdb\nDropper\nMacho\nx86_64\n\n\n\n\nIP Addresses\nDomains\nanalysis.arkinvst[.]com\nappleaccess[.]pro\narkinvst[.]com\natajerefoods[.]com\nbuy2x[.]com\ncalendly[.]caladan[.]video\ncardiagnostic[.]net\ncmt[.]ventures\ncommunity.edwardcaputo[.]shop\ncommunity.kevinaraujo[.]shop\ncommunity.selincapital[.]com\ncommunity.selincapital[.]com\ncustomer-app[.]xyz\ndelphidigital[.]org\ndoc.solanalab[.]org\ndourolab[.]xyz\ndrogueriasanjose[.]net\nedwardcaputo[.]shop\nemail.sellinicapital[.]com\nevalaskatours[.]com\nhappyz[.]one\nhwsrv-1225327.hostwindsdns[.]com\ninfo.ankanimatoka[.]com\ninfo.customer-app[.]xyz\nkevinaraujo[.]shop\nmaelstromfund[.]org\nmaelstroms[.]fund\nmatuaner[.]com\nmbupdate.linkpc[.]net\nmc.tvdhoenn[.]net\nmeet.caladan[.]video\nmeet.caladangroup[.]xyz\nmeet.hananetwork[.]video\nmeet.selinicapital[.]info\nmeet.selinicapital[.]online\nmeet.selinicapital[.]xyz\nmeet.sellinicapital[.]com\nmeeting.sellinicapital[.]com\nmeeting.zoom-client[.]com\nmg21.1056[.]uk\nnodnote.com\nonline.selinicapital[.]info\nonline.zoom-client[.]com\npanda95sg[.]asia\npixelmonmmo[.]net\npresentations[.]life\nselincapital[.]com\nselinicapital[.]info\nselinicapital[.]network\nselinicapital[.]online\nsellinicapital[.]com\nsendmailed[.]com\nsendmailer[.]org\nshh5.baranftw[.]xyz\ntvdhoenn[.]net\nverify.selinicapital[.]info\nversionupdate.dns[.]army\nwww.buy2x[.]com\nwww.delphidigital[.]org\nwww.frameworks[.]ventures\nwww.happyz[.]one\nwww.huspot[.]blog\nwww.maelstromfund[.]org\nwww.panda95sg[.]asia\nwww.prismlab[.]xyz\nwww.sellinicapital[.]com\nwww.sendmailed[.]com\nwww.sendmailer[.]org\nwww.yoannturp[.]xyz\nxu10.1056[.]uk\nzoom-client[.]com","enclosure":{"url":"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/BNThief-feature.jpg","length":"376259","type":"image/jpeg"},"dc:creator":"Raffaele Sabato, Phil Stokes &amp; Tom Hegel","content":"SentinelLabs has observed a suspected DPRK threat actor targeting Crypto-related businesses with novel multi-stage malware.","contentSnippet":"SentinelLabs has observed a suspected DPRK threat actor targeting Crypto-related businesses with novel multi-stage malware.","guid":"https://www.sentinelone.com/?post_type=labs&p=108328","categories":["DPRK"],"isoDate":"2024-11-07T10:55:47.000Z","tag":"intel"},{"creator":"Alex Delamotte","title":"Cloud Malware | A Threat Hunter’s Guide to Analysis, Techniques and Delivery","link":"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/cloud-malware-a-threat-hunters-guide-to-analysis-techniques-and-delivery/","pubDate":"Thu, 24 Oct 2024 15:17:35 +0000","content:encoded":"<p>As many researchers have noticed, malware in the cloud is different. Perhaps more strikingly different than Windows versus Linux threats, cloud services are targeted through entirely different methods altogether.</p>\n<p>At <a href=\"https://www.labscon.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LABScon 2024</a>, I gave a workshop <a href=\"https://www.labscon.io/speakers/alex-delamotte/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Taxonomy in the Troposphere</a> that outlines categories of cloud threats and how to approach analyzing and hunting them. The workshop structure highlighted three general sections to approach this problem:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">What cloud malware looks like</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Cloud malware taxonomy and exercises</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">How to approach threat hunting in the cloud</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What Does Cloud Malware Look Like?</h2>\n<p>Cloud threats are tailored for the specific environment or service being targeted. There are no comprehensive infostealers as are commonplace on platforms like macOS or Windows. Instead, individual facets of cloud security are targeted through a variety of means. Attackers run scripts remotely that interact with the targeted service’s API to achieve a goal like collecting credentials or automating the process of sending spam messages in bulk through a cloud or SaaS provider.</p>\n<p>We covered several unique families of cloud threats, including <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/dissecting-alienfox-the-cloud-spammers-swiss-army-knife/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AlienFox</a>, a cloud spamming tool; <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/cloudy-with-a-chance-of-credentials-aws-targeting-cred-stealer-expands-to-azure-gcp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TeamTNT’s</a> credential harvesting scripts; and <a href=\"https://www.cadosecurity.com/blog/cado-discovers-denonia-the-first-malware-specifically-targeting-lambda\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Denonia</a>, a cryptominer tailored to run in AWS serverless Lambda environment.</p>\n<p>We also explored the objectives of cloud attacks. These are less distinct from threats targeting any other attack surface, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Cryptomining</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Spamming</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Data theft</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Espionage</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Extortion</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Disruption, attacks on availability</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cloud threat delivery and installation is also different. Actors frequently rely on web application or SaaS misconfigurations that enable access to resources that should be restricted.</p>\n<p>Examples of this include exposed environment files–a very common occurrence in <a href=\"https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Laravel_Cheat_Sheet.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Laravel</a> implementation–as well as exposed <a href=\"https://0x1bitcrack3r.medium.com/how-i-found-misconfigured-jenkins-instances-of-different-organizations-using-shodan-9837088f4ec7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jenkins</a> instances. Exploitation of unpatched security vulnerabilities is perennially popular given the high prevalence of web frameworks running in cloud services.</p>\n<p>Credential exposure is a huge problem: organizations often unknowingly upload service credentials to publicly accessible code sharing services like Docker Hub, GitHub, or Pastebin, as outlined in a recent <a href=\"https://cybenari.com/2024/08/whats-the-worst-place-to-leave-your-secrets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">post</a> by Cybenari, which explores how long it takes for actors to identify and use the credentials.</p>\n<p>My colleagues at SentinelOne recently published an excellent <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/cloud-and-container-the-attack-defend-series/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">summary</a> of the most commonly leveraged cloud threat vectors, which complimented this workshop’s focus.</p>\n<h2>Cloud Malware Taxonomy &amp; Analysis</h2>\n<p>Taxonomy in the cloud can be difficult because many tools are based on full source code and actors often take a feature from one tool and roll it into another one. This makes attribution complicated, if not challenging. Because these tools are not deployed on the victim machine and are run on the attacker’s system, it can be unclear which tool used the code first.</p>\n<p>Cloud researchers often obtain samples from sources like VirusTotal, Pastebin, or from cybercriminal forums or Telegram channels. Unlike threats that target endpoints, which typically drop binaries or scripts that run in memory, threats running against cloud services leave only logs showing which APIs were called and in which order. While these can be valuable indicators for detection, they leave much to be desired in the way of seeing how actors implement their tooling.</p>\n<p>Analyzing cloud tools can be complex because some scripts are very large. I have analyzed several scripts with more than 10,000 lines of code. To make this task more manageable, researchers can take several approaches.</p>\n<p>One of my preferred methods is to perform a word frequency analysis that eliminates terms commonly used by the programming language of the script, revealing terms that are used highly frequently or infrequently. These outliers can provide strategic analytic starting points by highlighting terms that the tool focuses on, such as APIs, technologies, or credential categories.</p>\n<p>I use a Python script designed to analyze Python files for the occurrence of each term. The script reads the contents of the target file, filters out common terms used by the Python programming language, and writes output showing how many times each remaining term occurs.</p>\n<p>Running this script against a modified version of <a href=\"https://www.cadosecurity.com/blog/legion-an-aws-credential-harvester-and-smtp-hijacker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Legion Stealer</a> attributed to actor CobraEgy was quite helpful in reducing the volume of noise. The CobraEgy script contains more than 21,000 lines of Python code–a very daunting analysis task. The word frequency analysis script gave 3400 lines of words and the frequency they occurred. While this is still large, it’s easy to scroll through the results and find interesting terms.</p>\n<p>In the following output, around line 40 there are many terms that show the tool capabilities likely include spamming (<code>mailuser</code>, <code>mailport</code>, <code>mailfrom</code>, <code>host</code>, <code>get_smtp</code>, <code>smtp_login</code>), web server activity (<code>apache</code>), and cloud service activity (<code>aws_reg</code>, <code>aws_key</code>).</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_107676\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-107676\" style=\"width: 205px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Cloud_Mw_Analysis_6.jpg\" alt=\"Word frequency analysis output from CobraEgy tool\" width=\"205\" height=\"499\" class=\"size-full wp-image-107676\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Cloud_Mw_Analysis_6.jpg 205w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Cloud_Mw_Analysis_6-123x300.jpg 123w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 205px) 100vw, 205px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-107676\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Word frequency analysis output from CobraEgy tool</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Once you identify potentially interesting functionality, you can analyze those features. In the workshop,  participants were able to dive into commonly referenced cloud tool terms, such as <code>aws</code>, <code>azure</code>, <code>profile</code>, <code>admin</code>, <code>password</code>, <code>server</code>, <code>host</code>, <code>username</code>, and <code>port</code>.</p>\n<p>Looking at how these terms are used can provide insight into the tool’s capability and even yield valuable indicators of compromise that can be used to categorize the tool or an actor’s campaign. This approach is helpful when looking at many scripts at once, as you can run it as a grep command against an entire directory:</p>\n<pre>\r\ngrep -RinE --include=\\*.{py,sh} '\\b(aws|azure|profile|admin|password|server|host|username|port)\\b' /path/to/search\r\n</pre>\n<p>For simplicity, I asked students to run against only one of the malicious scripts. The following results from a TeamTNT shell script revealed interesting clues to the tool’s capability, such as credential files, cloud service provider capabilities, and hardcoded credentials to connect to an external server.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_107679\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-107679\" style=\"width: 988px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Cloud_Mw_Analysis_3.jpg\" alt=\"Keyword search against TeamTNT shell script\" width=\"988\" height=\"273\" class=\"size-full wp-image-107679\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Cloud_Mw_Analysis_3.jpg 988w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Cloud_Mw_Analysis_3-300x83.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Cloud_Mw_Analysis_3-768x212.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 988px) 100vw, 988px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-107679\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Keyword search against TeamTNT shell script</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Researchers can then cross-reference the search results against the original script, revealing its functionality.

Perhaps more strikingly different than Windows versus Linux threats, cloud services are targeted through entirely different methods altogether.\nAt LABScon 2024, I gave a workshop Taxonomy in the Troposphere that outlines categories of cloud threats and how to approach analyzing and hunting them. The workshop structure highlighted three general sections to approach this problem:\nWhat cloud malware looks like\nCloud malware taxonomy and exercises\nHow to approach threat hunting in the cloud\nWhat Does Cloud Malware Look Like?\nCloud threats are tailored for the specific environment or service being targeted. There are no comprehensive infostealers as are commonplace on platforms like macOS or Windows. Instead, individual facets of cloud security are targeted through a variety of means. Attackers run scripts remotely that interact with the targeted service’s API to achieve a goal like collecting credentials or automating the process of sending spam messages in bulk through a cloud or SaaS provider.\nWe covered several unique families of cloud threats, including AlienFox, a cloud spamming tool; TeamTNT’s credential harvesting scripts; and Denonia, a cryptominer tailored to run in AWS serverless Lambda environment.\nWe also explored the objectives of cloud attacks. These are less distinct from threats targeting any other attack surface, including:\nCryptomining\nSpamming\nData theft\nEspionage\nExtortion\nDisruption, attacks on availability\nCloud threat delivery and installation is also different. Actors frequently rely on web application or SaaS misconfigurations that enable access to resources that should be restricted.\nExamples of this include exposed environment files–a very common occurrence in Laravel implementation–as well as exposed Jenkins instances. Exploitation of unpatched security vulnerabilities is perennially popular given the high prevalence of web frameworks running in cloud services.\nCredential exposure is a huge problem: organizations often unknowingly upload service credentials to publicly accessible code sharing services like Docker Hub, GitHub, or Pastebin, as outlined in a recent post by Cybenari, which explores how long it takes for actors to identify and use the credentials.\nMy colleagues at SentinelOne recently published an excellent summary of the most commonly leveraged cloud threat vectors, which complimented this workshop’s focus.\nCloud Malware Taxonomy & Analysis\nTaxonomy in the cloud can be difficult because many tools are based on full source code and actors often take a feature from one tool and roll it into another one. This makes attribution complicated, if not challenging. Because these tools are not deployed on the victim machine and are run on the attacker’s system, it can be unclear which tool used the code first.\nCloud researchers often obtain samples from sources like VirusTotal, Pastebin, or from cybercriminal forums or Telegram channels. Unlike threats that target endpoints, which typically drop binaries or scripts that run in memory, threats running against cloud services leave only logs showing which APIs were called and in which order. While these can be valuable indicators for detection, they leave much to be desired in the way of seeing how actors implement their tooling.\nAnalyzing cloud tools can be complex because some scripts are very large. I have analyzed several scripts with more than 10,000 lines of code. To make this task more manageable, researchers can take several approaches.\nOne of my preferred methods is to perform a word frequency analysis that eliminates terms commonly used by the programming language of the script, revealing terms that are used highly frequently or infrequently. These outliers can provide strategic analytic starting points by highlighting terms that the tool focuses on, such as APIs, technologies, or credential categories.\nI use a Python script designed to analyze Python files for the occurrence of each term. The script reads the contents of the target file, filters out common terms used by the Python programming language, and writes output showing how many times each remaining term occurs.\nRunning this script against a modified version of Legion Stealer attributed to actor CobraEgy was quite helpful in reducing the volume of noise. The CobraEgy script contains more than 21,000 lines of Python code–a very daunting analysis task. The word frequency analysis script gave 3400 lines of words and the frequency they occurred. While this is still large, it’s easy to scroll through the results and find interesting terms.\nIn the following output, around line 40 there are many terms that show the tool capabilities likely include spamming (mailuser, mailport, mailfrom, host, get_smtp, smtp_login), web server activity (apache), and cloud service activity (aws_reg, aws_key).\nWord frequency analysis output from CobraEgy tool\nOnce you identify potentially interesting functionality, you can analyze those features. In the workshop,  participants were able to dive into commonly referenced cloud tool terms, such as aws, azure, profile, admin, password, server, host, username, and port.\nLooking at how these terms are used can provide insight into the tool’s capability and even yield valuable indicators of compromise that can be used to categorize the tool or an actor’s campaign. This approach is helpful when looking at many scripts at once, as you can run it as a grep command against an entire directory:\n\r\ngrep -RinE --include=\\*.{py,sh} '\\b(aws|azure|profile|admin|password|server|host|username|port)\\b' /path/to/search\r\n\nFor simplicity, I asked students to run against only one of the malicious scripts. The following results from a TeamTNT shell script revealed interesting clues to the tool’s capability, such as credential files, cloud service provider capabilities, and hardcoded credentials to connect to an external server.\nKeyword search against TeamTNT shell script\nResearchers can then cross-reference the search results against the original script, revealing its functionality. In this case, the azure.json hit was part of a larger credential file targeting list. The hardcoded username and password were used to connect to a C2 server to upload the data harvested from the system.\nCredential files targeted by TeamTNT shell script\nFunction used to send data to the C2 server\nWe also took a high level look at a Docker container that was used in TeamTNT’s 2023 SilentBob campaign. Docker containers are composed of layers: the container’s operating system is in the first layer, while subsequent layers are generated by instructions in the Dockerfile.\nDocker Desktop is a free tool that provides a nice interface for high-level analysis of a container’s features. Researchers can select the Docker image on the Images tab, then look at the layers. In the case of this container used by TeamTNT, there are 9 layers. Several layers have a command, which is shown on the Command pane.\nDocker layer showing tool installation commands\nThe container used in this attack is initialized, then downloads zgrab, a network scanning utility that TeamTNT uses to identify new systems to infect. Next, the container installs several utilities:\ntor: a binary that enables routing requests through the Tor anonymization network\ncurl, wget: utilities for creating HTTP requests\nlibproxychains3: enables routing connections through proxy servers for anonymity\nmasscan: network scanning utility used to identify new targets\nThese tools are used for identifying new victims and propagating the actor’s tools. The container also extracts several files from the base image, which are saved locally to the /usr/bin path and given read, write, and execute permissions. Researchers can mount the image–which I recommend doing in an isolated malware analysis environment–and copy the files to the local system for analysis.\nHunting in the Cloud\nThe workshop concluded by summarizing which artifacts from cloud tools can be hunted, as well as two types of hunting approaches: targeted and wide.\nA targeted hunting approach searches for specific indicators that are unique to a cloud threat family, such as Androxgh0st, FBot, or TeamTNT tools. For example, the following Androxgh0st strings are from unique variables recycled across many tools, including AlienFox:\nTargeted VirusTotal Livehunt rule searching for Androxgh0st strings\nIn the following example from FBot, the tool makes requests to a Lithuanian fashion designer’s website–robertkalinkin[.]com–to validate Paypal accounts. Interestingly, this Paypal validator is also used by other cloud attack tools, including Legion Stealer.\nDue to the Python code containing special characters that escape the string, I opted to use the hexadecimal equivalent of the variable and its contents, as shown in the comment below.\nTargeted VirusTotal Livehunt rule searching for a Paypal validator URL\nThe wide hunting approach looks for behavior, so researchers can identify new malware families conducting specific activities.

However, this CVERC report is not useless.</p>\n<p>The CVERC report tells us more about China’s intentions than it does convince readers of the PRC’s claims about Volt Typhoon. <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/chinas-cyber-revenge-why-the-prc-fails-to-back-its-claims-of-western-espionage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SentinelLabs has previously covered the CVERC’s behavior</a> and is issuing this report to update readers with specific takeaways based on the content of the third edition.</p>\n<p>In our first report, we highlighted a pattern of coordination between China’s cybersecurity companies, state media, the CVERC, and publications about U.S. hacking operations. We find that the pattern is thus: a cybersecurity company publishes a new report analyzing old leaked documents from the U.S. government, the CVERC picks up the piece and adds analysis–or in many cases, co-authors the report with the company–then state media regurgitate the report in English for international audiences.</p>\n<p>In some cases, these reports make their way into official PRC government press briefings. In one instance, a PRC embassy abroad re-hosted the report’s content. It is a full court-press to point the finger at U.S. hacking efforts without providing new or substantiated claims.</p>\n<p>It is clear that such efforts are state-directed, not merely by association of the organizations involved, but by the steady recurring drumbeat of publications. However, such a directive to produce more when there is nothing to be written is hard for writers and researchers. When writers are forced to fill a page count, they inevitably drift towards their own intentions as evidence of their claims run dry. The CVERC’s latest report falls victim to this trap.</p>\n<p>What follows is our distillation of what we believe analysts can learn from the latest CVERC report about China’s posture in geopolitics, cybersecurity, and hacking operations.</p>\n<h2>Targeting Section 702</h2>\n<p>The authors mention <a href=\"https://www.intel.gov/foreign-intelligence-surveillance-act/1237-fisa-section-702\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Section 702</a> authorities 13 times across 60 pages, and it is a clear focal point. Compromised devices in the U.S. and abroad constitute the botnets that Chinese operations rely on for obfuscation. Section 702 very likely enables U.S. collection of Chinese activities on these devices that are located in the US. Without Section 702, tracking Chinese hacking operations would be very difficult.</p>\n<p>However, Section 702 in the United States is controversial. Reviving the 702 debate is clearly in China’s interest and is their intent, as shown by how China highlighted “impacts to ordinary Americans.” No doubt that China hopes a policy move against potent U.S. counterintelligence tools would be in its interest. Will PRC influence ops push such narratives? Already, The Register’s cybersecurity editor <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/09/fbi_volt_typhoon_section_702/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wrote a piece</a> arguing the line that China clearly hoped to promote–that Volt Typhoon is an excuse to continue Section 702.</p>\n<p>The CVERC publication may be motivated by previous potential Russian successes in changing U.S. policy. Following Russian abuse of leaked NSA vulnerabilities and tools that caused massive economic losses (NotPetya), the U.S. policy community debated the curtailing of these tools. Committees held public hearings and the DNI suggested that if the U.S. could not control such capabilities, perhaps they should not be developed.</p>\n<p>This period coincides with what Ben Buchanan notes as the <a href=\"https://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/research/docs/buchanan_webreadypdf.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">end of the NOBUS era</a>. The result of Russia’s operations, which were cemented by DPRK bumbling a global ransom op (WannaCry), was the creation of the Vulnerabilities Equities Process (VEP), a process through which the majority of U.S. vulnerabilities discovered are burned and given to their manufacturer. China may hope to achieve a sunset to 702, just as the Russians—intentionally or not—instigated the VEP.</p>\n<h2>Pushing Foreign Tech Out of China</h2>\n<p>The CVERC report also draws Microsoft into its crosshairs and tracks the movement of former U.S. government officials to MSFT-related entities. Underpinning CVERC’s concern is <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/china/china-technology-software-delete-america-2b8ea89f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CCP Document Number 79</a>, which pushes for the removal of all foreign technology from PRC government systems. China’s efforts to create its own tech ecosystem, including a domestic operating system, epitomize the effort. CVERC is in no position to signal intent about stopping MSFT’s operations in China.</p>\n<p>Still, the report suggests the organization is emboldened in its stance on the company. More sure of itself than ever, the CCP seems ready to hit foreign firms that have long remained key IT providers in its ecosystem. Eventually, successful implementation of Document 79 will push MSFT almost entirely from the PRC technology ecosystem.</p>\n<h2>Shifting the Narrative in Europe</h2>\n<p>Finally, the CVERC’s mentions of France and Germany arrived at a time of <a href=\"https://www.gmfus.org/news/watching-china-europe-september-2024\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">intense infighting over the future of Europe and its relationship with China</a>. Until recently, German and French firms had been making hay of U.S. firms leaving the PRC. Buying assets on discount and doubling down with its in-country partners. Now, the sands are shifting.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68873836\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Germany arrested Chinese spies</a> earlier this year.

SentinelLabs has previously covered the CVERC’s behavior and is issuing this report to update readers with specific takeaways based on the content of the third edition.\nIn our first report, we highlighted a pattern of coordination between China’s cybersecurity companies, state media, the CVERC, and publications about U.S. hacking operations. We find that the pattern is thus: a cybersecurity company publishes a new report analyzing old leaked documents from the U.S. government, the CVERC picks up the piece and adds analysis–or in many cases, co-authors the report with the company–then state media regurgitate the report in English for international audiences.\nIn some cases, these reports make their way into official PRC government press briefings. In one instance, a PRC embassy abroad re-hosted the report’s content. It is a full court-press to point the finger at U.S. hacking efforts without providing new or substantiated claims.\nIt is clear that such efforts are state-directed, not merely by association of the organizations involved, but by the steady recurring drumbeat of publications. However, such a directive to produce more when there is nothing to be written is hard for writers and researchers. When writers are forced to fill a page count, they inevitably drift towards their own intentions as evidence of their claims run dry. The CVERC’s latest report falls victim to this trap.\nWhat follows is our distillation of what we believe analysts can learn from the latest CVERC report about China’s posture in geopolitics, cybersecurity, and hacking operations.\nTargeting Section 702\nThe authors mention Section 702 authorities 13 times across 60 pages, and it is a clear focal point. Compromised devices in the U.S. and abroad constitute the botnets that Chinese operations rely on for obfuscation. Section 702 very likely enables U.S. collection of Chinese activities on these devices that are located in the US. Without Section 702, tracking Chinese hacking operations would be very difficult.\nHowever, Section 702 in the United States is controversial. Reviving the 702 debate is clearly in China’s interest and is their intent, as shown by how China highlighted “impacts to ordinary Americans.” No doubt that China hopes a policy move against potent U.S. counterintelligence tools would be in its interest. Will PRC influence ops push such narratives? Already, The Register’s cybersecurity editor wrote a piece arguing the line that China clearly hoped to promote–that Volt Typhoon is an excuse to continue Section 702.\nThe CVERC publication may be motivated by previous potential Russian successes in changing U.S. policy. Following Russian abuse of leaked NSA vulnerabilities and tools that caused massive economic losses (NotPetya), the U.S. policy community debated the curtailing of these tools. Committees held public hearings and the DNI suggested that if the U.S. could not control such capabilities, perhaps they should not be developed.\nThis period coincides with what Ben Buchanan notes as the end of the NOBUS era. The result of Russia’s operations, which were cemented by DPRK bumbling a global ransom op (WannaCry), was the creation of the Vulnerabilities Equities Process (VEP), a process through which the majority of U.S. vulnerabilities discovered are burned and given to their manufacturer. China may hope to achieve a sunset to 702, just as the Russians—intentionally or not—instigated the VEP.\nPushing Foreign Tech Out of China\nThe CVERC report also draws Microsoft into its crosshairs and tracks the movement of former U.S. government officials to MSFT-related entities. Underpinning CVERC’s concern is CCP Document Number 79, which pushes for the removal of all foreign technology from PRC government systems. China’s efforts to create its own tech ecosystem, including a domestic operating system, epitomize the effort. CVERC is in no position to signal intent about stopping MSFT’s operations in China.\nStill, the report suggests the organization is emboldened in its stance on the company. More sure of itself than ever, the CCP seems ready to hit foreign firms that have long remained key IT providers in its ecosystem. Eventually, successful implementation of Document 79 will push MSFT almost entirely from the PRC technology ecosystem.\nShifting the Narrative in Europe\nFinally, the CVERC’s mentions of France and Germany arrived at a time of intense infighting over the future of Europe and its relationship with China. Until recently, German and French firms had been making hay of U.S. firms leaving the PRC. Buying assets on discount and doubling down with its in-country partners. Now, the sands are shifting.\nGermany arrested Chinese spies earlier this year. The Dutch publicly attributed hacking campaigns to China. In France, the police stopped Chinese diplomats from forcibly repatriating a dissident and asked two PRC spies to leave the country. Who knows what happens behind closed doors in Brussels, but suffice to say that the CVERC doesn’t like what it sees in public.\nHighlighting what those governments already know about past leaks of USG/FVEY spying is likely aimed at shaping narratives, but says more about CVERC’s intent than anything the report may achieve.\nAs usual, and as SentinelLabs has previously written, the report is paired with propaganda coverage but, for the first time, has also been published in Japanese, French, and German, in addition to English and Chinese.","enclosure":{"url":"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/china-influence-feature.jpg","length":"326838","type":"image/jpeg"},"dc:creator":"Dakota Cary","content":"China's CVERC attempts to attribute Volt Typhoon activities to the U.S., but the fact-free claims reveal much about the PRC's real agenda.","contentSnippet":"China's CVERC attempts to attribute Volt Typhoon activities to the U.S., but the fact-free claims reveal much about the PRC's real agenda.","guid":"https://www.sentinelone.com/?post_type=labs&p=107173","categories":["China"],"isoDate":"2024-10-16T14:23:52.000Z","tag":"intel"},{"creator":"Jim Walter","title":"Kryptina RaaS | From Unsellable Cast-Off to Enterprise Ransomware","link":"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/kryptina-raas-from-unsellable-cast-off-to-enterprise-ransomware/","pubDate":"Mon, 23 Sep 2024 10:00:00 +0000","content:encoded":"<h2>Executive Summary</h2>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Kryptina evolved from a free tool on public forums to being actively used in enterprise attacks, particularly under the Mallox ransomware family.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">In May 2024, a Mallox affiliate leaked staging server data, revealing that their Linux ransomware was based on a modified version of Kryptina.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The affiliate made superficial changes to source code and documentation, stripping Kryptina branding but retaining core functionality.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">The adoption of Kryptina by Mallox affiliates exemplifies the commoditization of ransomware tools, complicating malware tracking as affiliates blend different codebases into new variants.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">This original research was presented by the author at <a href=\"https://labscon.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LABScon 2024</a> in Scottsdale, Arizona.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>In February of 2024, SentinelOne posted a <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/kryptina-raas-from-underground-commodity-to-open-source-threat/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">write-up</a> on Kryptina Ransomware-as-a-Service, a free and open-source RaaS platform written for Linux. At the time, Kryptina provided all the components required to host a fully functional RaaS platform. This included the ability to automate payloads, manage multiple groups and campaigns nested within, as well as configure the ransom payment requirements such as the amount and type of payment. Despite such functionality, the offering struggled to attract much interest from dark market customers.</p>\n<p>In May 2024, an affiliate of the Mallox RaaS exposed one of their staging servers. As a result of this leak, we identified Kryptina RaaS to be the platform on which the affiliate’s Linux variants were based. The affiliate threat actor referred to this Linux variant as “Mallox v1.0”. This ‘evolution’ of Kryptina is notable in a rags-to-riches sort of way. In the span of a few months, the tool went from an unsellable give-away in public forums to being observed in active SMB/Enterprise attacks.</p>\n<p>In this research, we explore the data exposed in the open directory leak, detailing differences between the original Kryptina RaaS (v2.2) and the modified version branded under the Mallox moniker.</p>\n<h2>Brief History of Kryptina &amp; Mallox</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/anthology/mallox/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mallox</a> (<i>aka</i> <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/mallox-resurrected-ransomware-attacks-exploiting-ms-sql-continue-to-burden-enterprises/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TargetCompany</a>) ransomware is a longstanding, Enterprise-focused, RaaS. The family emerged in 2021 and is sometimes referred to as FARGO, XOLLAM, or BOZON, due to the extension appended to encrypted files in some variants. Mallox operators are known to opportunistically target ‘timely’ vulnerabilities (e.g., <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/mallox-resurrected-ransomware-attacks-exploiting-ms-sql-continue-to-burden-enterprises/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MSSQL Server</a>). Individual affiliate behavior will vary, though this style of exploitation, along with brute force attacks to establish initial access, is common across Mallox campaigns.</p>\n<p>Kryptina was first offered for sale by the “Corlys” identity in December 2023. The price for the full suite, at the time, was $500.00, and later raised to $800.00. In February 2024, “Corlys” put a halt to the active sales of Kryptina, and subsequently posted the full source code to <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-in-cybersecurity-week-20-5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BreachForums</a>.</p>\n<p>In May, 2024, an open directory which contained staged payloads along with Mallox builder tools and source was <a href=\"https://x.com/banthisguy9349/status/1796431710470721600\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">discovered</a>.

The keys and configuration data are obfuscated via XOR and then base64 encoded (the XOR key depends on the value set in the builder or scripts). The function <code>krptna_process_file()</code> function is responsible for the file encryption. This function is a typical implementation of file encryption/decryption using the AES-256-CBC algorithm in OpenSSL.</p>\n<p>This function initializes an OpenSSL cipher context <code>EVP_CIPHER_CTX_new()</code>. This is passed to the appropriate function, depending on what mode was chosen in the builder configuration (demo mode, etc). File input and output streams are processed via <code>EVP_CipherUpdate()</code>, which transforms unencrypted file data to the encrypted data in the output buffer. This is then written to the final output file (as the modified/encrypted file). <code>EVP_CipherFinal</code> finalizes the processes handling any padding (integral to CBC mode).</p>\n<p>All the legacy Kryptina code is included in the <code>/src</code> folder of the affiliates server, with the files themselves even retaining the Kryptina naming conventions and references to known functions (e.g., <code>krptna_process_file()</code>).&#8221;</div>\n<figure id=\"attachment_105864\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-105864\" style=\"width: 658px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kryptina_Mallox_8.jpg\" alt=\"Kryptina-specific functions in Mallox Linux 1.0\" width=\"658\" height=\"335\" class=\"size-full wp-image-105864\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kryptina_Mallox_8.jpg 658w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kryptina_Mallox_8-300x153.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-105864\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kryptina-specific functions in Mallox Linux 1.0</figcaption></figure>\n<p>With the exception of the aforementioned Kryptina database, the Kryptina branding has been stripped from most of the source and support files for “Mallox Linux 1.0”.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_105874\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-105874\" style=\"width: 759px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kryptina_Mallox_25.jpg\" alt=\"Mallox Linux 1.0 “Documentation”\" width=\"759\" height=\"154\" class=\"size-full wp-image-105874\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kryptina_Mallox_25.jpg 759w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kryptina_Mallox_25-300x61.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 759px) 100vw, 759px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-105874\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mallox Linux 1.0 documentation</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Documentation for the Kryptina-derived Mallox variations is included, though it is a distilled version of the original Kryptina documentation.

Aside from changing comments in the file to reference Mallox, and removing references to the Kryptina author (“Corlys”), the source is unchanged.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_105873\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-105873\" style=\"width: 859px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kryptina_Mallox_26.jpg\" alt=\"Mallox 1.0 src, with KRPTNA_DEBUG printf Mallox\" width=\"859\" height=\"349\" class=\"size-full wp-image-105873\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kryptina_Mallox_26.jpg 859w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kryptina_Mallox_26-300x122.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kryptina_Mallox_26-768x312.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 859px) 100vw, 859px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-105873\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mallox 1.0 src, with <em>KRPTNA_DEBUG printf -&gt;Mallox</em></figcaption></figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_105871\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-105871\" style=\"width: 1108px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kryptina_Mallox_28.jpg\" alt=\"Original Kryptina 2.2 kryptina.c source file\" width=\"1108\" height=\"766\" class=\"size-full wp-image-105871\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kryptina_Mallox_28.jpg 1108w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kryptina_Mallox_28-300x207.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kryptina_Mallox_28-1024x708.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kryptina_Mallox_28-768x531.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1108px) 100vw, 1108px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-105871\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Original Kryptina 2.2 <em>kryptina.c</em> source file</figcaption></figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_105876\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-105876\" style=\"width: 1166px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kryptina_Mallox_23.jpg\" alt=\"Mallox 1.0 kryptina.c source file\" width=\"1166\" height=\"860\" class=\"size-full wp-image-105876\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kryptina_Mallox_23.jpg 1166w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kryptina_Mallox_23-300x221.jpg 300w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kryptina_Mallox_23-1024x755.jpg 1024w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kryptina_Mallox_23-768x566.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1166px) 100vw, 1166px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-105876\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mallox 1.0 <em>kryptina.c</em> source file</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Kryptina’s original <code>scripting_demo.py</code> file provided threat actors with a way to build Linux payloads via the command line.

This can be called directly via script, or via the web UI while building payloads within campaigns.</p>\n<p>Kryptina (and subsequently Mallox 1.0) supports multiple modes within the compiled payloads. These are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">demo &#8211; builds a demo version of Kryptina, no encryption</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">debug &#8211; provides customized debug output</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">symbols &#8211; provides debug build with debug symbols (-ggdb3)</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">arch32 &#8211; output 32-bit payload</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional parameter values are provided for other conditions present in the builder. This includes the ability to customize the XOR key use for encoding the encrypted configuration data within payloads (<code>xor</code>), thread count to use during the encryption process (<code>jobs</code>), toggling of the self deletion feature (<code>persist</code>), and filesize constraints (<code>maxsize</code>) to enforce during encryption (e.g., maximum size of file to attempt to decrypt). Secure deletion (wiper’esque capability) can be toggled via the <code>secdel</code> parameter. </p>\n<p>Example makefiles from the original Kryptina package and the Mallox-modified package appear as follows:</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_105870\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-105870\" style=\"width: 652px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kryptina_Mallox_29.jpg\" alt=\"Kryptina Mallox makefile\" width=\"652\" height=\"490\" class=\"size-full wp-image-105870\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kryptina_Mallox_29.jpg 652w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kryptina_Mallox_29-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 652px) 100vw, 652px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-105870\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kryptina makefile</figcaption></figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_105888\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-105888\" style=\"width: 643px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kryptina_Mallox_12.jpg\" alt=\"Mallox Linux 1.0 makefile\" width=\"643\" height=\"456\" class=\"size-full wp-image-105888\" srcset=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kryptina_Mallox_12.jpg 643w, https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kryptina_Mallox_12-300x213.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 643px) 100vw, 643px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-105888\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mallox Linux 1.0 makefile</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Victim Subfolders</h2>\n<p>The May 2024 affiliate leak also contained target-specific output folders for 14 targets (potential victims).

Individual affiliates introducing different codebases into the mix further muddies the water, ultimately increasing the level of difficulty when tracking these tools and understanding the scope of their use and adoption. Looking forward, we expect to see more outlier platforms like Kryptina being absorbed into the TTPs leveraged by more advanced threat actors.</p>\n<h2>IOCs</h2>\n<p><b>Files SHA1</b><br />\n0b9d2895d29f7d553e5613266c2319e10afdda78<br />\n0de92527430dc0794694787678294509964422e6<br />\n0e83d023b9f6c34ab029206f1f11b3457171a30a<br />\n0f1aea2cf0c9f2de55d2b920618a5948c5e5e119<br />\n0f632f8e59b8c8b99241d0fd5ff802f31a3650cd<br />\n1379a1b08f938f9a53082150d53efadb2ad37ae5<br />\n21bacf8daa45717e87a39842ec33ad61d9d79cfe<br />\n262497702d6b7f7d4af73a90cb7d0e930f9ec355<br />\n29936b1aa952a89905bf0f7b7053515fd72d8c5c<br />\n2b3fc20c4521848f33edcf55ed3d508811c42861<br />\n341552a8650d2bdad5f3ec12e333e3153172ee66<br />\n43377911601247920dc15e9b22eda4c57cb9e743<br />\n58552820ba2271e5c3a76b30bd3a07144232b9b3<br />\n5cf67c0a1fa06101232437bee5111fefcd8e2df4<br />\n88a039be03abc7305db724079e1a85810088f900<br />\n9050419cbecc88be7a06ea823e270db16f47c1ea<br />\n93ef3578f9c3db304a979b0d9d36234396ec6ac9<br />\na1a8922702ffa8c74aba9782cca90c939dfb15bf<br />\nb07c725edb65a879d392cd961b4cb6a876e40e2d<br />\nb27d291596cc890d283e0d3a3e08907c47e3d1cc<br />\nb768ba3e6e03a77004539ae999bb2ae7b1f12c62<br />\nc20e8d536804cf97584eec93d9a89c09541155bc<br />\nc4d988135e960e88e7acfae79a45c20e100984b6<br />\nd46fbc4a57dce813574ee312001eaad0aa4e52de<br />\nd618a9655985c33e69a4713ebe39d473a4d58cde<br />\ndc3f98dded6c1f1e363db6752c512e01ac9433f3<br />\nee3cd3a749f5146cf6d4b36ee87913c51b9bfe93<br />\nef2565c789316612d8103056cec25f77674d78d1<br />\nf17d9b3cd2ba1dea125d2e1a4aeafc6d4d8f12dc</p>\n<p><b>Network Comms</b><br />\n185[.]73.125[.]6<br />\ngrovik71[.]theweb[.]place</p>\n<p><b>Tox ID</b><br />\n290E6890D02FBDCD92659056F9A95D80854534A4D76EE5D3A64AFD55E584EA398722EC2D3697</p>\n<p><b>BTC Address</b><br />\n18CUq89XR81Y7Ju2UBjER14fYWTfVwpGP3</p>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"Executive Summary\nKryptina evolved from a free tool on public forums to being actively used in enterprise attacks, particularly under the Mallox ransomware family.\nIn May 2024, a Mallox affiliate leaked staging server data, revealing that their Linux ransomware was based on a modified version of Kryptina.\nThe affiliate made superficial changes to source code and documentation, stripping Kryptina branding but retaining core functionality.\nThe adoption of Kryptina by Mallox affiliates exemplifies the commoditization of ransomware tools, complicating malware tracking as affiliates blend different codebases into new variants.\nThis original research was presented by the author at LABScon 2024 in Scottsdale, Arizona.\nBackground\nIn February of 2024, SentinelOne posted a write-up on Kryptina Ransomware-as-a-Service, a free and open-source RaaS platform written for Linux. At the time, Kryptina provided all the components required to host a fully functional RaaS platform. This included the ability to automate payloads, manage multiple groups and campaigns nested within, as well as configure the ransom payment requirements such as the amount and type of payment. Despite such functionality, the offering struggled to attract much interest from dark market customers.\nIn May 2024, an affiliate of the Mallox RaaS exposed one of their staging servers. As a result of this leak, we identified Kryptina RaaS to be the platform on which the affiliate’s Linux variants were based. The affiliate threat actor referred to this Linux variant as “Mallox v1.0”. This ‘evolution’ of Kryptina is notable in a rags-to-riches sort of way. In the span of a few months, the tool went from an unsellable give-away in public forums to being observed in active SMB/Enterprise attacks.\nIn this research, we explore the data exposed in the open directory leak, detailing differences between the original Kryptina RaaS (v2.2) and the modified version branded under the Mallox moniker.\nBrief History of Kryptina & Mallox\nMallox (aka TargetCompany) ransomware is a longstanding, Enterprise-focused, RaaS. The family emerged in 2021 and is sometimes referred to as FARGO, XOLLAM, or BOZON, due to the extension appended to encrypted files in some variants. Mallox operators are known to opportunistically target ‘timely’ vulnerabilities (e.g., MSSQL Server). Individual affiliate behavior will vary, though this style of exploitation, along with brute force attacks to establish initial access, is common across Mallox campaigns.\nKryptina was first offered for sale by the “Corlys” identity in December 2023. The price for the full suite, at the time, was $500.00, and later raised to $800.00. In February 2024, “Corlys” put a halt to the active sales of Kryptina, and subsequently posted the full source code to BreachForums.\nIn May, 2024, an open directory which contained staged payloads along with Mallox builder tools and source was discovered. This staging server was erected by a Mallox affiliate and hosts a number of attacker-related tools. \nFirst discovery of an open directory on Mallox affiliate server\nThe staging server, hosted on 185[.]73.125[.]6, contained numerous archives and payloads specific to the Windows version of Mallox. \nMallox staging server with web application and source\nHowever, the affiliate’s server also contained all the (modified) source files for Kryptina, including the accessible web server and interface for building Mallox Linux (Kryptina) payloads, and managing separate infection campaigns. \nKryptina source files in Mallox leak\nKryptina database in Mallox leak\nThe use of Kryptina by this affiliate appears to be singular: other Linux variants of Mallox are not based on Kryptina, further complicating the the relationship between Kryptina and Mallox.\nCustomizing Kryptina\nEncryption and decryption routines in “Mallox Linux 1.0” are identical to original Kryptina. To recap from our previous write-up:\n“Individual file encryption is achieved through use of AES256 in CBC mode. The keys and configuration data are obfuscated via XOR and then base64 encoded (the XOR key depends on the value set in the builder or scripts). The function krptna_process_file() function is responsible for the file encryption. This function is a typical implementation of file encryption/decryption using the AES-256-CBC algorithm in OpenSSL.\nThis function initializes an OpenSSL cipher context EVP_CIPHER_CTX_new(). This is passed to the appropriate function, depending on what mode was chosen in the builder configuration (demo mode, etc). File input and output streams are processed via EVP_CipherUpdate(), which transforms unencrypted file data to the encrypted data in the output buffer. This is then written to the final output file (as the modified/encrypted file). EVP_CipherFinal finalizes the processes handling any padding (integral to CBC mode).\nAll the legacy Kryptina code is included in the /src folder of the affiliates server, with the files themselves even retaining the Kryptina naming conventions and references to known functions (e.g., krptna_process_file()).”\nKryptina-specific functions in Mallox Linux 1.0\nWith the exception of the aforementioned Kryptina database, the Kryptina branding has been stripped from most of the source and support files for “Mallox Linux 1.0”.\nMallox Linux 1.0 documentation\nDocumentation for the Kryptina-derived Mallox variations is included, though it is a distilled version of the original Kryptina documentation. The original Kryptia PDF (SHA1: d46fbc4a57dce813574ee312001eaad0aa4e52de) has been slimmed down and included as docs.md. Included sections have been translated to Russian from the original English version.\nOriginal Kryptina RaaS documentation\nModified Mallox Linux 1.0 documentation\nThe updated Mallox Linux 1.0 documentation contains sections covering basic features, environmental setup (dependencies and version affinities), along with setup and configuration of phpMyAdmin and the backend DB (MySQL).\nMallox Linux 1.0 dependencies\nMallox Linux 1.0 DB (MySQL) configuration\nThe affiliate made a few changes to the Kryptina source files and scripts in order to remove references to Kryptina and associate the comments and naming conventions to those of Mallox.\nRansom note templates are structured similarly to the original Kryptina version. The \\note folder on the affiliate server contains the template source, which can be customized directly or via the Kryptina web UI. The template for the ransom note was updated to remove the Kryptina 2.x references, replacing them with Mallox v1.0.\nKryptina original ransom note template\nMallox 1.0 ransom note template\nThe main source files for “Mallox 1.0” were held in the /src folder of the affiliate server. The original names of the encryptor and decryptor source files (kryptina.c and kryptina.h) retain the Kryptina-centric names. The only operational change to the Kryptina encryptor code is the updating of printed output in Debug mode (updated to Mallox). Aside from changing comments in the file to reference Mallox, and removing references to the Kryptina author (“Corlys”), the source is unchanged.\nMallox 1.0 src, with KRPTNA_DEBUG printf ->Mallox\nOriginal Kryptina 2.2 kryptina.c source file\nMallox 1.0 kryptina.c source file\nKryptina’s original scripting_demo.py file provided threat actors with a way to build Linux payloads via the command line. All the requisite fields are provided in the template. This allows for quick and automated builds. While these scripted builds are not reflected in the web UI, it can be a valuable tool to a threat actor wanting to streamline the automation of new builds over time. The scripting_demo.py file has been minimally updated, again to reflect Mallox branding over Kryptina. References to “Corlys” have been removed as well.\nOriginal Kryptina scripting_demo.py source file\nMallox 1.0 scripting_demo.py source file\nComparing Kryptina and Mallox makefiles\nThe makefile is used when building encryptor and decryptor payloads. This can be called directly via script, or via the web UI while building payloads within campaigns.\nKryptina (and subsequently Mallox 1.0) supports multiple modes within the compiled payloads. These are:\ndemo – builds a demo version of Kryptina, no encryption\ndebug – provides customized debug output\nsymbols – provides debug build with debug symbols (-ggdb3)\narch32 – output 32-bit payload\nAdditional parameter values are provided for other conditions present in the builder. This includes the ability to customize the XOR key use for encoding the encrypted configuration data within payloads (xor), thread count to use during the encryption process (jobs), toggling of the self deletion feature (persist), and filesize constraints (maxsize) to enforce during encryption (e.g., maximum size of file to attempt to decrypt). Secure deletion (wiper’esque capability) can be toggled via the secdel parameter. \nExample makefiles from the original Kryptina package and the Mallox-modified package appear as follows:\nKryptina makefile\nMallox Linux 1.0 makefile\nVictim Subfolders\nThe May 2024 affiliate leak also contained target-specific output folders for 14 targets (potential victims). Some of this information was previously detailed here.\nIn the \\output folder, subfolders exist for each target (unique ‘Target Name’ value).\nOutput folder on affiliate staging server\nSome of these folders contain config.json files (builder configuration) alongside the matching encryptor/decryptor binary pairs. There are empty folders as well, meaning those targets were defined, but payloads have yet to be built.\nAffiliate output directory with payloads and configs\nEach of the config files contains values for all the fields required in the builder scripts. This includes payment type and addresses. The configuration JSON contains values for the following:\nabout\namount\narch32\nbitcoin\ndeadline\n\n\ndebug\ndemo\nextension\nignore\niv\n\n\njobs\nkey\nmaxsize\nmonero\nname\n\n\nnolog\nnonote\nnote\nnote_name\npersist\n\n\nrecommend\nsecdel\nsession\nstatic\nsymbols\n\n\ntarget_id\ntargets\ntox\nverbose\nxor_key\n\n\n\n\nExample config.json\nSeven of the victim subfolders contained corresponding config.json files and compiled encryptor & decryptor tools. All of the JSON files have similar values assigned for the requisite field. All of the targets were configured with the same payment address (BTC 18CUq89XR81Y7Ju2UBjER14fYWTfVwpGP3). Other requisite values are repeated across campaigns as well. This includes the values for “key”, “bitcoin” and “extension”.

These are utilized by the threat actor in the early stages of attack, primarily for beachhead establishment and privilege escalation.\nWindows-focused droppers and tools on affiliate leak site\nKLAPR.ZIP extracts to KLAPR.BAT (SHA1:43377911601247920dc15e9b22eda4c57cb9e743). This tool is provided by the affiliate to assist in the neutralization of Kaspersky endpoint products where needed. This binary is a copy of the “Kaspersky Lab AllProducts Password Reset v2.0” tool. This is a legitimate support tool from Kaspersky Labs. Specific security products from Kaspersky require an application-specific password to allow for changing of configuration settings (locally) or other management tasks. This .BAT file resets (nullifies) the stored password values for a multitude of Kaspersky products.\nExploit code for CVE-2024-21338 is included as well. CVE-2024-21338 is a local privilege escalation flaw in Windows 10 and 11 where HVCI (Hypervisor-Protected Code Integrity) is enabled. This exploit is based on the proof-of-concept code provided in a writeup from Hakai Security. The same code is also hosted on the hakaioffsec GitHub repository.\nCVE-2024-21338 Exploit Readme\nCVE-2024-21338 has been associated with other Mallox campaigns, as well as Lazarus.\nMultiple droppers for Mallox (Windows) are included, including a commented s.ps1 PowerShell script. This script, hosted at the root of the open directory, provides a template for PowerShell privilege escalation and payload execution. Some basic environmental discovery commands are included (e.g., Get-WmiObject -Namespace \"root\\SecurityCenter2\" -Class AntiVirusProduct).\ns.ps1 script from Mallox affiliate leak\nA Mallox (Windows) dropper named Application.jar (SHA1: 5cf67c0a1fa06101232437bee5111fefcd8e2df4) was also present. This dropper launches a PowerShell script that downloads a copy of Mallox from the same server (as id.exe; SHA1: 0f1aea2cf0c9f2de55d2b920618a5948c5e5e119). The PowerShell commands are embedded within the nested MyClass.class as Java bytecode. MyClass.class contains reference to a temporary DNS resolution for the host at grovik71.theweb[.]place.\nDNS name revealed (grovik71.theweb[.]place)\nA copy of the Java JRE (8.0.4010.10) is hosted on the affiliate server. Jre-8u401-windows-x64.exe is a full offline installer of the JRE (SHA1: dc3f98dded6c1f1e363db6752c512e01ac9433f3).\nFinally, multiple additional dropper/payload sets were hosted at the root of the site. These include packages split for 32 and 64 bit use, and a .LNK-based dropper for the payloads.\nDroppers separated by architecture\nReader.img and Reader+x86.img are compressed disk image files that contain Mallox (Windows) payloads for 64 and 32 bit systems, respectively. Each of these images contains the same .LNK launcher (SHA1: c20e8d536804cf97584eec93d9a89c09541155bc), which is named Reader.lnk.\n.LNK Launcher for Mallox (Windows)\nThe payload contained within these compressed images is named red.exe.\n\r\nred.exe (x86) - SHA1: 29936b1aa952a89905bf0f7b7053515fd72d8c5c\r\nred.exe (x64) - SHA1: 0f1aea2cf0c9f2de55d2b920618a5948c5e5e119\r\n\nThis instance of the 64-bit payload (SHA1: 0f1aea2cf0c9f2de55d2b920618a5948c5e5e119) is identical to the prior referenced id.exe and the hosted MSiedge.exe.\nConclusion\nThe Kryptina-derived variants of Mallox are affiliate-specific and separate from other Linux variants of Mallox  that have since emerged, an indication of how the ransomware landscape has evolved into a complex menagerie of cross-pollinated toolsets and non-linear codebases. \nThe adoption of Kryptina – a RaaS given away as a free tool after the developer’s failure to cash-in on it – by an active Mallox affiliate represents a kind of ‘levelling-up’ for the malware. More importantly, it demonstrates the broader trend of ransomware commoditization. \nThe leakage of powerful tools like the LockBit, Yashma, and Babuk builders along with Kryptina RaaS has obscured the lineage and proliferation of related malware families. Individual affiliates introducing different codebases into the mix further muddies the water, ultimately increasing the level of difficulty when tracking these tools and understanding the scope of their use and adoption. Looking forward, we expect to see more outlier platforms like Kryptina being absorbed into the TTPs leveraged by more advanced threat actors.\nIOCs\nFiles SHA1\nNetwork Comms\nTox ID\nBTC Address\n18CUq89XR81Y7Ju2UBjER14fYWTfVwpGP3","enclosure":{"url":"https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kryptina-Desert-Ftr.jpg","length":"802915","type":"image/jpeg"},"dc:creator":"Jim Walter","content":"Kryptina's adoption by Mallox affiliates complicates malware tracking as ransomware operators blend different codebases into new variants.","contentSnippet":"Kryptina's adoption by Mallox affiliates complicates malware tracking as ransomware operators blend different codebases into new variants.","guid":"https://www.sentinelone.com/?post_type=labs&p=105715","categories":["Ransomware"],"isoDate":"2024-09-23T10:00:00.000Z","tag":"intel"},{"creator":"LABScon","title":"LABScon23 Replay | They Spilled Oil in My Health-Boosting Smoothie","link":"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/labscon23-replay-they-spilled-oil-in-my-health-boosting-smoothie/","pubDate":"Thu, 05 Sep 2024 15:25:14 +0000","content:encoded":"<p>OilRig is a well-known Iran-aligned cyberespionage group, allegedly under the MOIS (Ministry of Intelligence and Security), that has been targeting Middle Eastern governments and a variety of business verticals since at least 2014.
