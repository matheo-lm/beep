And they are not traditional SMS phishing or &#8220;<strong>smishing</strong>&#8221; messages, as they bypass the mobile networks entirely.

Merrill has been studying the evolution of several China-based smishing gangs, and found that most of them feature helpful and informative video tutorials in their sales accounts on Telegram. Those videos show the thieves are loading multiple stolen digital wallets on a single mobile device, and then selling those phones in bulk for hundreds of dollars apiece.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Who says carding is dead?,&#8221; said Merrill, who presented about his findings at the <a href=\"https://www.m3aawg.org/upcoming-meetings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">M3AAWG</a> security conference in Lisbon earlier today. &#8220;This is the best mag stripe cloning device ever.

But they also offer a more cutting-edge mobile fraud technology: Merrill found that at least one of the Chinese phishing groups sells an Android app called &#8220;<strong>ZNFC</strong>&#8221; that can relay a valid NFC transaction to anywhere in the world. The user simply waves their phone at a local payment terminal that accepts Apple or Google pay, and the app relays an NFC transaction over the Internet from a phone in China.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ekqZjPAxB4c?si=hYLqGPIBrNthAg9_\" width=\"750\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<p>&#8220;The software can work from anywhere in the world,&#8221; Merrill said. &#8220;These guys provide the software for $500 a month, and it can relay both NFC enabled tap-to-pay as well as any digital wallet.

Image: The Straits Times.</p></div>\n<h2>ADVANCED PHISHING TECHNIQUES</h2>\n<p>According to Merrill, the phishing pages that spoof the USPS and various toll road operators are powered by several innovations designed to maximize the extraction of victim data.</p>\n<p>For example, a would-be smishing victim might enter their personal and financial information, but then decide the whole thing is scam before actually submitting the data. In this case, anything typed into the data fields of the phishing page will be captured in real time, regardless of whether the visitor actually clicks the &#8220;submit&#8221; button.</p>\n<p>Merrill said people who submit payment card data to these phishing sites often are then told their card can&#8217;t be processed, and urged to use a different card. This technique, he said, sometimes allows the phishers to steal more than one mobile wallet per victim.</p>\n<p>Many phishing websites expose victim data by storing the stolen information directly on the phishing domain. But Merrill said these Chinese phishing kits will forward all victim data to a back-end database operated by the phishing kit vendors. That way, even when the smishing sites get taken down for fraud, the stolen data is still safe and secure.</p>\n<p>Another important innovation is the use of mass-created Apple and Google user accounts through which these phishers send their spam messages. One of the Chinese phishing groups posted images on their Telegram sales channels showing how these robot Apple and Google accounts are loaded onto Apple and Google phones, and arranged snugly next to each other in an expansive, multi-tiered rack that sits directly in front of the phishing service operator.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70435\" style=\"width: 528px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70435\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-70435\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/phonesashtray.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"518\" height=\"688\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-70435\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The ashtray says: You&#8217;ve been phishing all night.</p></div>\n<p>In other words, the smishing websites are powered by real human operators as long as new messages are being sent. Merrill said the criminals appear to send only a few dozen messages at a time, likely because completing the scam takes manual work by the human operators in China. After all, most one-time codes used for mobile wallet provisioning are generally only good for a few minutes before they expire.</p>\n<p>Notably, none of the phishing sites spoofing the toll operators or postal services will load in a regular Web browser; they will only render if they detect that a visitor is coming from a mobile device.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One of the reasons they want you to be on a mobile device is they want you to be on the same device that is going to receive the one-time code,&#8221; Merrill said. &#8220;They also want to minimize the chances you will leave. And if they want to get that mobile tokenization and grab your one-time code, they need a live operator.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Merrill found the Chinese phishing kits feature another innovation that makes it simple for customers to turn stolen card details into a mobile wallet: They programmatically take the card data supplied by the phishing victim and convert it into a digital image of a real payment card that matches that victim&#8217;s financial institution. That way, attempting to enroll a stolen card into Apple Pay, for example, becomes as easy as scanning the fabricated card image with an iPhone.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70439\" style=\"width: 407px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70439\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-70439\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/phish-cabelas.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"397\" height=\"488\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-70439\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">An ad from a Chinese SMS phishing group&#8217;s Telegram channel showing how the service converts stolen card data into an image of the stolen card.</p></div>\n<p>&#8220;The phone isn&#8217;t smart enough to know whether it&#8217;s a real card or just an image,&#8221; Merrill said. &#8220;So it scans the card into Apple Pay, which says okay we need to verify that you&#8217;re the owner of the card by sending a one-time code.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>PROFITS</h2>\n<p>How profitable are these mobile phishing kits? The best guess so far comes from data gathered by other security researchers who&#8217;ve been tracking these advanced Chinese phishing vendors.</p>\n<p>In August 2023, the security firm Resecurity <a href=\"https://www.resecurity.com/blog/article/smishing-triad-targeted-usps-and-us-citizens-for-data-theft\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">discovered a vulnerability</a> in one popular Chinese phish kit vendor&#8217;s platform that exposed the personal and financial data of phishing victims. Resecurity dubbed the group the <strong>Smishing Triad</strong>, and found the gang had harvested 108,044 payment cards across 31 phishing domains (3,485 cards per domain).</p>\n<p>In August 2024, security researcher <strong>Grant Smith</strong> gave <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLOv67LlIQs&amp;list=PL9fPq3eQfaaB2scbXRczwvjVH0ckX4bwt&amp;index=14\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a presentation</a> at the DEFCON security conference about tracking down the Smishing Triad after scammers spoofing the U.S. Postal Service <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/usps-scam-text-smishing-triad/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">duped his wife</a>. By identifying a different vulnerability in the gang&#8217;s phishing kit, Smith said he was able to see that people entered 438,669 unique credit cards in 1,133 phishing domains (387 cards per domain).</p>\n<p>Based on his research, Merrill said it&#8217;s reasonable to expect between $100 and $500 in losses on each card that is turned into a mobile wallet. Merrill said they observed nearly 33,000 unique domains tied to these Chinese smishing groups during the year between the publication of Resecurity&#8217;s research and Smith&#8217;s DEFCON talk.</p>\n<p>Using a median number of 1,935 cards per domain and a conservative loss of $250 per card, that comes out to about $15 billion in fraudulent charges over a year.</p>\n<p>Merrill was reluctant to say whether he&#8217;d identified additional security vulnerabilities in any of the phishing kits sold by the Chinese groups, noting that the phishers quickly fixed the vulnerabilities that were detailed publicly by Resecurity and Smith.</p>\n<h2>FIGHTING BACK</h2>\n<p>Adoption of touchless payments took off in the United States after the Coronavirus pandemic emerged, and many financial institutions in the United States were eager to make it simple for customers to link payment cards to mobile wallets. Thus, the authentication requirement for doing so defaulted to sending the customer a one-time code via SMS.</p>\n<p>Experts say the continued reliance on one-time codes for onboarding mobile wallets has fostered this new wave of carding.

But experts say it&#8217;s unrealistic to expect retailers will be eager to replace existing payment terminals before their expected lifespans expire.</p>\n<p>And of course Apple and Google have an increased role to play as well, given that their accounts are being created en masse and used to blast out these smishing messages. Both companies could easily tell which of their devices suddenly have 7-10 different mobile wallets added from 7-10 different people around the world. They could also recommend that financial institutions use more secure authentication methods for mobile wallet provisioning.</p>\n<p>Neither Apple nor Google responded to requests for comment on this story.</p>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"Carding — the underground business of stealing, selling and swiping stolen payment card data — has long been the dominion of Russia-based hackers.

A review of chat logs from some of those channels show other members frequently referred to Rivage as &#8220;Edward.&#8221;</p>\n<p>From late 2020 to late 2024, Rivage&#8217;s conversations would show up in multiple Com chat servers that are closely monitored by security companies.

It’s unclear whether Coristine worked at Path concurrently with those hackers, and WIRED found no evidence that either Coristine or other Path employees engaged in illegal activity while at the company.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The founder of Path is a young man named <strong>Marshal Webb</strong>. I wrote about Webb back in 2016, in a story about a DDoS defense company he co-founded called <strong>BackConnect Security LLC</strong>. On September 20, 2016, KrebsOnSecurity published data showing that the company <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/ddos-mitigation-firm-has-history-of-hijacks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">had a history of hijacking Internet address space that belonged to others</a>.</p>\n<p>Less than 24 hours after that story ran, KrebsOnSecurity.com was <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-record-ddos/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hit with the biggest DDoS attack the Internet had ever seen at the time</a>.

Not long after Coristine&#8217;s termination, someone leaked an abundance of internal Path documents and conversations.

Rivage expressed frustration with his time spent on Com-based communities, suggesting that its profitability had been oversold.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a lot of money to be made in the com,&#8221; Rivage lamented. &#8220;I&#8217;m not buying Heztner [servers] to set up some com VPN.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Rivage largely stopped posting messages on Com channels after that. <em>Wired</em> reports that Coristine subsequently spent three months last summer working at <strong>Neuralink</strong>, Elon Musk&#8217;s brain implant startup.</p>\n<p>The trouble with all this is that even if someone sincerely intends to exit The Com after years of consorting with cybercriminals, they are often still subject to personal attacks, harassment and hacking long after they have left the scene.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s because a huge part of Com culture involves harassing, swatting and hacking other members of the community. These internecine attacks are often for financial gain, but just as frequently they are perpetrated by cybercrime groups to exact retribution from or assert dominance over rival gangs.</p>\n<p>Experts say it is extremely difficult for former members of violent street gangs to gain a security clearance needed to view sensitive or classified information held by the U.S. government. That&#8217;s because ex-gang members are highly susceptible to extortion and coercion from current members of the same gang, and that alone presents an unacceptable security risk for intelligence agencies.</p>\n<p>And make no mistake: The Com is the English-language cybercriminal hacking equivalent of a violent street gang. KrebsOnSecurity has published numerous stories detailing how feuds within the community <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/09/violence-as-a-service-brickings-firebombings-shootings-for-hire/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">periodically spill over into real-world violence</a>.</p>\n<p>When Coristine&#8217;s name surfaced in <em>Wired</em>&#8216;s report this week, members of The Com immediately took notice. In the following segment from a February 5, 2025 chat in a Com-affiliated hosting provider, members criticized Rivage&#8217;s skills, and discussed harassing his family and notifying authorities about incriminating accusations that may or may not be true.</p>\n<blockquote><p>2025-02-05 16:29:44 UTC vperked#0 they got this nigga on indiatimes man<br />\n2025-02-05 16:29:46 UTC alexaloo#0 Their cropping is worse than AI could have done<br />\n2025-02-05 16:29:48 UTC hebeatsme#0 bro who is that<br />\n2025-02-05 16:29:53 UTC hebeatsme#0 yalla re talking about<br />\n2025-02-05 16:29:56 UTC xewdy#0 edward<br />\n2025-02-05 16:29:56 UTC .yarrb#0 rivagew<br />\n2025-02-05 16:29:57 UTC vperked#0 Rivarge<br />\n2025-02-05 16:29:57 UTC xewdy#0 diamondcdm<br />\n2025-02-05 16:29:59 UTC vperked#0 i cant spell it<br />\n2025-02-05 16:30:00 UTC hebeatsme#0 rivage<br />\n2025-02-05 16:30:08 UTC .yarrb#0 yes<br />\n2025-02-05 16:30:14 UTC hebeatsme#0 i have him added<br />\n2025-02-05 16:30:20 UTC hebeatsme#0 hes on discord still<br />\n2025-02-05 16:30:47 UTC .yarrb#0 hes focused on stroking zaddy elon<br />\n2025-02-05 16:30:47 UTC vperked#0 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Coristine<br />\n2025-02-05 16:30:50 UTC vperked#0 no fucking way<br />\n2025-02-05 16:30:53 UTC vperked#0 they even made a wiki for him<br />\n2025-02-05 16:30:55 UTC vperked#0 LOOOL<br />\n2025-02-05 16:31:05 UTC hebeatsme#0 no way<br />\n2025-02-05 16:31:08 UTC hebeatsme#0 hes not a good dev either<br />\n2025-02-05 16:31:14 UTC hebeatsme#0 like????<br />\n2025-02-05 16:31:22 UTC hebeatsme#0 has to be fake<br />\n2025-02-05 16:31:24 UTC xewdy#0 and theyre saying ts<br />\n2025-02-05 16:31:29 UTC xewdy#0 like ok bro<br />\n2025-02-05 16:31:51 UTC .yarrb#0 now i wanna know what all the other devs are like&#8230;<br />\n2025-02-05 16:32:00 UTC vperked#0 &#8220;`Coristine used the moniker &#8220;bigballs&#8221;

After all, he&#8217;d recently been dismissed from a job <em>for allegedly leaking internal company information to outsiders</em>.</p>\n<p>According to the national security adjudication <a href=\"https://www.dni.gov/files/NCSC/documents/Regulations/SEAD-4-Adjudicative-Guidelines-U.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">guidelines</a> (PDF) released by the <strong>Director of National Intelligence</strong> (DNI), eligibility determinations take into account a person&#8217;s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, discretion, character, honesty, judgment, and ability to protect classified information.</p>\n<p>The DNI policy further states that &#8220;eligibility for covered individuals shall be granted only when facts and circumstances indicate that eligibility is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States, and any doubt shall be resolved in favor of national security.&#8221;</p>\n<p>On Thursday, 25-year-old DOGE staff member <strong>Marko Elez</strong> resigned after being linked to a deleted social media account that advocated racism and eugenics. Elez resigned after <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/doge-staffer-resigns-over-racist-posts-d9f11a93\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">asked</a> the White House about his connection to the account.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Just for the record, I was racist before it was cool,” the account posted in July. &#8220;You could not pay me to marry outside of my ethnicity,” the account wrote on X in September. &#8220;Normalize Indian hate,&#8221; the account wrote the same month, in reference to a post noting the prevalence of people from India in Silicon Valley.</p>\n<p>Elez&#8217;s resignation came a day after the Department of Justice agreed to limit the number of DOGE employees who have access to federal payment systems. The DOJ said access would be limited to two people, Elez and <strong>Tom Krause</strong>, the CEO of a company called Cloud Software Group.</p>\n<p>Earlier today, Musk <a href=\"https://thehill.com/business/5133430-elon-musk-doge-staffer-racist-posts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">said he planned to rehire Elez</a> after <strong>President Trump</strong> and <strong>Vice President JD Vance</strong> reportedly endorsed the idea. Speaking at The White House today, Trump said he wasn&#8217;t concerned about the security of personal information and other data accessed by DOGE, adding that he was &#8220;very proud of the job that this group of young people&#8221; are doing.</p>\n<p>A White House official <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/staffer-with-elon-musks-doge-amplified-white-supremacists-online-2025-02-07/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">told</a> <em>Reuters</em> on Wednesday that Musk and his engineers have appropriate security clearances and are operating in &#8220;full compliance with federal law, appropriate security clearances, and as employees of the relevant agencies, not as outside advisors or entities.&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>NPR</em> <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/07/nx-s1-5288988/doge-elon-musk-staff-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reports</a> Trump added that his administration&#8217;s cost-cutting efforts would soon turn to the Education Department and the Pentagon, &#8220;where he suggested without evidence that there could be &#8216;trillions&#8217; of dollars in wasted spending within the $6.75 trillion the federal government spent in fiscal year 2024.&#8221;</p>\n<p>GOP leaders in the Republican-controlled House and Senate have largely shrugged about Musk&#8217;s ongoing efforts to seize control over federal databases, dismantle agencies mandated by Congress, freeze federal spending on a range of already-appropriated government programs, and threaten workers with layoffs.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, multiple parties have sued to stop DOGE&#8217;s activities.

As today’s story explores, the DOGE teen is a former denizen of ‘The Com,’ an archipelago of Discord and Telegram chat channels that function as a kind of distributed cybercriminal social network for facilitating instant collaboration.\nSince President Trump’s second inauguration, Musk’s DOGE team has gained access to a truly staggering amount of personal and sensitive data on American citizens, moving quickly to seize control over databases at the U.S. Treasury, the Office of Personnel Management, the Department of Education, and the Department of Health and Human Resources, among others.\nWired first reported on Feb. 2 that one of the technologists on Musk’s crew is a 19-year-old high school graduate named Edward Coristine, who reportedly goes by the nickname “Big Balls” online. One of the companies Coristine founded, Tesla.Sexy LLC, was set up in 2021, when he would have been around 16 years old.\n“Tesla.Sexy LLC controls dozens of web domains, including at least two Russian-registered domains,” Wired reported. “One of those domains, which is still active, offers a service called Helfie, which is an AI bot for Discord servers targeting the Russian market. While the operation of a Russian website would not violate US sanctions preventing Americans doing business with Russian companies, it could potentially be a factor in a security clearance review.”\nMr. Coristine has not responded to requests for comment. In a follow-up story this week, Wired found that someone using a Telegram handle tied to Coristine solicited a DDoS-for-hire service in 2022, and that he worked for a short time at a company that specializes in protecting customers from DDoS attacks.\n\nA profile photo from Coristine’s WhatsApp account.\n\nInternet routing records show that Coristine runs an Internet service provider called Packetware (AS400495). Also known as “DiamondCDN,” Packetware currently hosts tesla[.]sexy and diamondcdn[.]com, among other domains.\nDiamondCDN was advertised and claimed by someone who used the nickname “Rivage” on several Com-based Discord channels over the years. A review of chat logs from some of those channels show other members frequently referred to Rivage as “Edward.”\nFrom late 2020 to late 2024, Rivage’s conversations would show up in multiple Com chat servers that are closely monitored by security companies. In November 2022, Rivage could be seen requesting recommendations for a reliable and powerful DDoS-for-hire service.\nRivage made that request in the cybercrime channel “Dstat,” a core Com hub where users could buy and sell attack services. Dstat’s website dstat[.]cc was seized in 2024 as part of “Operation PowerOFF,” an international law enforcement action against DDoS services.\nCoristine’s LinkedIn profile said that in 2022 he worked at an anti-DDoS company called Path Networks, which Wired generously described as a “network monitoring firm known for hiring reformed blackhat hackers.” Wired wrote:\n“At Path Network, Coristine worked as a systems engineer from April to June of 2022, according to his now-deleted LinkedIn résumé. Path has at times listed as employees Eric Taylor, also known as Cosmo the God, a well-known former cybercriminal and member of the hacker group UGNazis, as well as Matthew Flannery, an Australian convicted hacker whom police allege was a member of the hacker group LulzSec. It’s unclear whether Coristine worked at Path concurrently with those hackers, and WIRED found no evidence that either Coristine or other Path employees engaged in illegal activity while at the company.”\nThe founder of Path is a young man named Marshal Webb. I wrote about Webb back in 2016, in a story about a DDoS defense company he co-founded called BackConnect Security LLC. On September 20, 2016, KrebsOnSecurity published data showing that the company had a history of hijacking Internet address space that belonged to others.\nLess than 24 hours after that story ran, KrebsOnSecurity.com was hit with the biggest DDoS attack the Internet had ever seen at the time. That sustained attack kept this site offline for nearly 4 days.\nThe other founder of BackConnect Security LLC was Tucker Preston, a Georgia man who pleaded guilty in 2020 to paying a DDoS-for-hire service to launch attacks against others.\nThe aforementioned Path employee Eric Taylor pleaded guilty in 2017 to charges including an attack on our home in 2013. Taylor was among several men involved in making a false report to my local police department about a supposed hostage situation at our residence in Virginia. In response, a heavily-armed police force surrounded my home and put me in handcuffs at gunpoint before the police realized it was all a dangerous hoax known as “swatting.”\nCosmoTheGod rocketed to Internet infamy in 2013 when he and a number of other hackers set up the Web site exposed[dot]su, which “doxed” dozens of public officials and celebrities by publishing the address, Social Security numbers and other personal information on the former First Lady Michelle Obama, the then-director of the FBI and the U.S. attorney general, among others. The group also swatted many of the people they doxed.\nWired noted that Coristine only worked at Path for a few months in 2022, but the story didn’t mention why his tenure was so short. A screenshot shared on the website pathtruths.com includes a snippet of conversations in June 2022 between Path employees discussing Coristine’s firing.\nAccording to that record, Path founder Marshal Webb dismissed Coristine for leaking internal documents to a competitor. Not long after Coristine’s termination, someone leaked an abundance of internal Path documents and conversations. Among other things, those chats revealed that one of Path’s technicians was a Canadian man named Curtis Gervais who was convicted in 2017 of perpetrating dozens of swatting attacks and fake bomb threats — including at least two attempts against our home in 2014.\n\nA snippet of text from an internal Path chat room, wherein members discuss the reason for Coristine’s termination: Allegedly, leaking internal company information. Source: Pathtruths.com.\n\n\nOn May 11, 2024, Rivage posted on a Discord channel for a DDoS protection service that is chiefly marketed to members of The Com. Rivage expressed frustration with his time spent on Com-based communities, suggesting that its profitability had been oversold.\n“I don’t think there’s a lot of money to be made in the com,” Rivage lamented. “I’m not buying Heztner [servers] to set up some com VPN.”\nRivage largely stopped posting messages on Com channels after that. Wired reports that Coristine subsequently spent three months last summer working at Neuralink, Elon Musk’s brain implant startup.\nThe trouble with all this is that even if someone sincerely intends to exit The Com after years of consorting with cybercriminals, they are often still subject to personal attacks, harassment and hacking long after they have left the scene.\nThat’s because a huge part of Com culture involves harassing, swatting and hacking other members of the community. These internecine attacks are often for financial gain, but just as frequently they are perpetrated by cybercrime groups to exact retribution from or assert dominance over rival gangs.\nExperts say it is extremely difficult for former members of violent street gangs to gain a security clearance needed to view sensitive or classified information held by the U.S. government. That’s because ex-gang members are highly susceptible to extortion and coercion from current members of the same gang, and that alone presents an unacceptable security risk for intelligence agencies.\nAnd make no mistake: The Com is the English-language cybercriminal hacking equivalent of a violent street gang. KrebsOnSecurity has published numerous stories detailing how feuds within the community periodically spill over into real-world violence.\nWhen Coristine’s name surfaced in Wired‘s report this week, members of The Com immediately took notice. In the following segment from a February 5, 2025 chat in a Com-affiliated hosting provider, members criticized Rivage’s skills, and discussed harassing his family and notifying authorities about incriminating accusations that may or may not be true.\n2025-02-05 16:29:44 UTC vperked#0 they got this nigga on indiatimes man\n\nGiven the speed with which Musk’s DOGE team was allowed access to such critical government databases, it strains credulity that Coristine could have been properly cleared beforehand. After all, he’d recently been dismissed from a job for allegedly leaking internal company information to outsiders.\nAccording to the national security adjudication guidelines (PDF) released by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), eligibility determinations take into account a person’s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, discretion, character, honesty, judgment, and ability to protect classified information.\nThe DNI policy further states that “eligibility for covered individuals shall be granted only when facts and circumstances indicate that eligibility is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States, and any doubt shall be resolved in favor of national security.”\nOn Thursday, 25-year-old DOGE staff member Marko Elez resigned after being linked to a deleted social media account that advocated racism and eugenics. Elez resigned after The Wall Street Journal asked the White House about his connection to the account.\n“Just for the record, I was racist before it was cool,” the account posted in July. “You could not pay me to marry outside of my ethnicity,” the account wrote on X in September. “Normalize Indian hate,” the account wrote the same month, in reference to a post noting the prevalence of people from India in Silicon Valley.\nElez’s resignation came a day after the Department of Justice agreed to limit the number of DOGE employees who have access to federal payment systems. The DOJ said access would be limited to two people, Elez and Tom Krause, the CEO of a company called Cloud Software Group.\nEarlier today, Musk said he planned to rehire Elez after President Trump and Vice President JD Vance reportedly endorsed the idea. Speaking at The White House today, Trump said he wasn’t concerned about the security of personal information and other data accessed by DOGE, adding that he was “very proud of the job that this group of young people” are doing.\nA White House official told Reuters on Wednesday that Musk and his engineers have appropriate security clearances and are operating in “full compliance with federal law, appropriate security clearances, and as employees of the relevant agencies, not as outside advisors or entities.”\nNPR reports Trump added that his administration’s cost-cutting efforts would soon turn to the Education Department and the Pentagon, “where he suggested without evidence that there could be ‘trillions’ of dollars in wasted spending within the $6.75 trillion the federal government spent in fiscal year 2024.”\nGOP leaders in the Republican-controlled House and Senate have largely shrugged about Musk’s ongoing efforts to seize control over federal databases, dismantle agencies mandated by Congress, freeze federal spending on a range of already-appropriated government programs, and threaten workers with layoffs.\nMeanwhile, multiple parties have sued to stop DOGE’s activities. ABC News says a federal judge was to rule today on whether DOGE should be blocked from accessing Department of Labor records, following a lawsuit alleging Musk’s team sought to illegally access highly sensitive data, including medical information, from the federal government.\nAt least 13 state attorneys general say they plan to file a lawsuit to stop DOGE from accessing federal payment systems containing Americans’ sensitive personal information, reports The Associated Press.\nReuters reported Thursday that the U.S. Treasury Department had agreed not to give Musk’s team access to its payment systems while a judge is hearing arguments in a lawsuit by employee unions and retirees alleging Musk illegally searched those records.\nArs Technica writes that The Department of Education (DoE) was sued Friday by a California student association demanding an “immediate stop” to DOGE’s “unlawfully” digging through student loan data to potentially dismantle the DoE.","dc:creator":"BrianKrebs","comments":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/02/teen-on-musks-doge-team-graduated-from-the-com/#comments","content":"Wired reported this week that a 19-year-old working for Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was given access to sensitive US government systems even though his past association with cybercrime communities should [...]","contentSnippet":"Wired reported this week that a 19-year-old working for Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was given access to sensitive US government systems even though his past association with cybercrime communities should have precluded him from gaining the necessary security clearances to do so.

Krebs was fired by President Trump in November 2020 for declaring the presidential contest was the most secure in American history, and for refuting Trump&#8217;s false claims of election fraud.</p>\n<p>South Dakota Governor <strong>Kristi Noem</strong>, confirmed by the U.S. Senate last week as the new director of the DHS, criticized CISA at her confirmation hearing, <em>TheRecord</em> <a href=\"https://therecord.media/kristi-noem-cisa-smaller-nimble?utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-80A9JU5jFUojRnewo-h4MRW17b74bMAW6oR5rGLelMqQ7jRJp3Ors1qYeq5RFK2jrpXM9V5J2o-RGJSorsePm_8KCvoZ8nFsrOw8h_pdBDQggry0c&amp;_hsmi=343361648&amp;utm_content=343361495&amp;utm_source=hs_email\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reports</a>.</p>\n<p>Noem told lawmakers CISA needs to be &#8220;much more effective, smaller, more nimble, to really fulfill their mission,&#8221; which she said should be focused on hardening federal IT systems and hunting for digital intruders. Noem said the agency&#8217;s work on fighting misinformation shows it has &#8220;gotten far off mission&#8221; and involved &#8220;using their resources in ways that was never intended.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The misinformation and disinformation that they have stuck their toe into and meddled with, should be refocused back onto what their job is,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p><strong>Moses Frost</strong>, a cybersecurity instructor with the SANS Institute, compared the sacking of the CSRB members to firing all of the experts at the <strong>National Transportation Safety Board</strong> (NTSB) while they&#8217;re in the middle of an investigation into a string of airline disasters.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don’t recall seeing an &#8216;NTSB Board&#8217; being fired during the middle of a plane crash investigation,&#8221; Frost said in a recent SANS newsletter. &#8220;I can say that the attackers in the phone companies will not stop because the review board has gone away. We do need to figure out how these attacks occurred, and CISA did appear to be doing some good for the vast majority of the federal systems.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Speaking of transportation, <em>The Record</em> notes that Transportation Security Administration chief <strong>David Pekoske</strong> <a href=\"https://therecord.media/tsa-chief-behind-cyber-directives-ousted-trump-administration?utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_a5PHD4Ff2FlOiHIlYbcfVNbftiTItDbxlH5TxzCLZicEcan3et6L6nmVmhC57_5AXp-a1k45WwHO6jbVxejLlMjPtTTdVzGtbreDzSl6fzHhGdkg&amp;_hsmi=343497657&amp;utm_content=343496082&amp;utm_source=hs_email\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">was fired</a> despite overseeing critical cybersecurity improvements across pipeline, rail and aviation sectors.

The president fired all advisors from the Department of Homeland Security’s Cyber Safety Review Board, called for the creation of a strategic cryptocurrency reserve, and voided a Biden administration action that sought to reduce the risks that artificial intelligence poses to consumers, workers and national security.\nOn his first full day back in the White House, Trump dismissed all 15 advisory committee members of the Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB), a nonpartisan government entity established in February 2022 with a mandate to investigate the causes of major cybersecurity events. The CSRB has so far produced three detailed reports, including an analysis of the Log4Shell vulnerability crisis, attacks from the cybercrime group LAPSUS$, and the 2023 Microsoft Exchange Online breach.\nThe CSRB was in the midst of an inquiry into cyber intrusions uncovered recently across a broad spectrum of U.S. telecommunications providers at the hands of Chinese state-sponsored hackers.

At the time, Chenlun had just introduced new phishing pages made to impersonate postal services in the United States and at least a dozen other countries.\nSMS phishing kits are hardly new, but Merrill said Chinese smishing groups recently have introduced innovations in deliverability, by more seamlessly integrating their spam messages with Apple’s iMessage technology, and with RCS, the equivalent “rich text” messaging capability built into Android devices.\n“While traditional smishing kits relied heavily on SMS for delivery, nowadays the actors make heavy use of iMessage and RCS because telecom operators can’t filter them and they likely have a higher success rate with these delivery channels,” he said.\nIt remains unclear how the phishers have selected their targets, or from where their data may be sourced. A notice from MassDOT cautions that “the targeted phone numbers seem to be chosen at random and are not uniquely associated with an account or usage of toll roads.”\nIndeed, one reader shared on Mastodon yesterday that they’d received one of these SMS phishing attacks spoofing a local toll operator, when they didn’t even own a vehicle.\nTargeted or not, these phishing websites are dangerous because they are operated dynamically in real-time by criminals. If you receive one of these messages, just ignore it or delete it, but please do not visit the phishing site. The FBI asks that before you bin the missives, consider filing a complaint with the agency’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), including the phone number where the text originated, and the website listed within the text.","dc:creator":"BrianKrebs","comments":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/01/chinese-innovations-spawn-wave-of-toll-phishing-via-sms/#comments","content":"Residents across the United States are being inundated with text messages purporting to come from toll road operators like E-ZPass, warning that recipients face fines if a delinquent toll fee remains unpaid.

However, new details about the internal operations of a prolific voice phishing gang show the group routinely abuses legitimate services at Apple and Google to force a variety of outbound communications to their users, including emails, automated phone calls and system-level messages sent to all signed-in devices.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69859\" style=\"width: 711px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69859\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-69859\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/thumb-mobile.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"701\" height=\"413\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-69859\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image: Shutterstock, iHaMoo.</p></div>\n<p>KrebsOnSecurity recently told the saga of a cryptocurrency investor named <strong>Tony</strong> who was robbed of more than $4.7 million in <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/12/how-to-lose-a-fortune-with-just-one-bad-click/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">an elaborate voice phishing attack</a>. In Tony&#8217;s ordeal, the crooks appear to have initially contacted him via <strong>Google Assistant</strong>, an AI-based service that can engage in two-way conversations. The phishers also abused legitimate Google services to send Tony an email from google.com, and to send a Google account recovery prompt to all of his signed-in devices.</p>\n<p>Today&#8217;s story pivots off of Tony&#8217;s heist and new details shared by a scammer to explain how these voice phishing groups are abusing a legitimate Apple telephone support line to generate &#8220;account confirmation&#8221; message prompts from Apple to their customers.</p>\n<p>Before we get to the Apple scam in detail, we need to revisit Tony&#8217;s case. The phishing domain used to steal roughly $4.7 million in cryptocurrencies from Tony was <strong>verify-trezor[.]io</strong>. This domain was featured in <a href=\"https://www.lookout.com/threat-intelligence/article/cryptochameleon-fcc-phishing-kit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a writeup from February 2024</a> by the security firm <strong>Lookout</strong>, which found it was one of dozens being used by a prolific and audacious voice phishing group it dubbed &#8220;<strong>Crypto Chameleon</strong>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Crypto Chameleon was brazenly trying to voice phish employees at the <strong>U.S. Federal Communications Commission</strong> (FCC), as well as those working at the cryptocurrency exchanges <strong>Coinbase</strong> and <strong>Binance</strong>. Lookout researchers discovered multiple voice phishing groups were using a new phishing kit that closely mimicked the single sign-on pages for <strong>Okta</strong> and other authentication providers.</p>\n<p>As we&#8217;ll see in a moment, that phishing kit is operated and rented out by a cybercriminal known as &#8220;<strong>Perm</strong>&#8221; a.k.a. &#8220;<strong>Annie</strong>.&#8221; Perm is the current administrator of <strong>Star Fraud</strong>, one of the more consequential cybercrime communities on Telegram and one that has emerged as a foundry of innovation in voice phishing attacks.</p>\n<p>A review of the many messages that Perm posted to Star Fraud and other Telegram channels showed they worked closely with another cybercriminal who went by the handles &#8220;<strong>Aristotle</strong>&#8221; and just &#8220;<strong>Stotle</strong>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It is not clear what caused the rift, but at some point last year Stotle decided to turn on his erstwhile business partner Perm, sharing extremely detailed videos, tutorials and secrets that shed new light on how these phishing panels operate.</p>\n<p>Stotle explained that the division of spoils from each robbery is decided in advance by all participants. Some co-conspirators will be paid a set fee for each call, while others are promised a percentage of any overall amount stolen. The person in charge of managing or renting out the phishing panel to others will generally take a percentage of each theft, which in Perm&#8217;s case is 10 percent.</p>\n<p>When the phishing group settles on a target of interest, the scammers will create and join a new <strong>Discord</strong> channel. This allows each logged on member to share what is currently on their screen, and these screens are tiled in a series of boxes so that everyone can see all other call participant screens at once.</p>\n<p>Each participant in the call has a specific role, including:</p>\n<p>-The Caller: The person speaking and trying to social engineer the target.<br />\n-The Operator: The individual managing the phishing panel, silently moving the victim from page to page.<br />\n-The Drainer: The person who logs into compromised accounts to drain the victim&#8217;s funds.<br />\n-The Owner: The phishing panel owner, who will frequently listen in on and participate in scam calls.</p>\n<h2>&#8216;OKAY, SO THIS REALLY IS APPLE&#8217;</h2>\n<p>In one video of a live voice phishing attack shared by Stotle, scammers using Perm&#8217;s panel targeted a musician in California. Throughout the video, we can see Perm monitoring the conversation and operating the phishing panel in the upper right corner of the screen.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/F44un1_y2fs?si=fmYxbcLS3TDtHjrs\" width=\"750\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">﻿</span></iframe></div>\n<p>In the first step of the attack, they <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/03/recent-mfa-bombing-attacks-targeting-apple-users/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">peppered the target&#8217;s Apple device with notifications from Apple</a> by attempting to reset his password. Then a &#8220;<strong>Michael Keen</strong>&#8221; called him, spoofing Apple&#8217;s phone number and saying they were with Apple&#8217;s account recovery team.</p>\n<p>The target told Michael that someone was trying to change his password, which Michael calmly explained they would investigate. Michael said he was going to send a prompt to the man&#8217;s device, and proceeded to place a call to an automated line that answered as Apple support saying, &#8220;I&#8217;d like to send a consent notification to your Apple devices. Do I have permission to do that?&#8221;</p>\n<p>In this segment of the video, we can see the operator of the panel is calling the real Apple customer support phone number <strong>800-275-2273</strong>, but they are doing so by spoofing the target&#8217;s phone number (the victim&#8217;s number is redacted in the video above). That&#8217;s because calling this support number from a phone number tied to an Apple account and selecting &#8220;1&#8221; for &#8220;yes&#8221; will then send an alert from Apple that displays the following message on all associated devices:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70000\" style=\"width: 403px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-70000\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-70000\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/appleconfirmation.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"393\" height=\"448\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-70000\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Calling the Apple support number 800-275-2273 from a phone number tied to an Apple account will cause a prompt similar to this one to appear on all connected Apple devices.</p></div>\n<p>KrebsOnSecurity asked two different security firms to test this using the caller ID spoofing service shown in Perm&#8217;s video, and sure enough calling that 800 number for Apple by spoofing my phone number as the source caused the Apple Account Confirmation to pop up on all of my signed-in Apple devices.</p>\n<p>In essence, the voice phishers are using an automated Apple phone support line to send notifications from Apple and to trick people into thinking they&#8217;re really talking with Apple. The phishing panel video leaked by Stotle shows this technique fooled the target, who felt completely at ease that he was talking to Apple after receiving the support prompt on his iPhone.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Okay, so this really is Apple,&#8221; the man said after receiving the alert from Apple. &#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s definitely not me trying to reset my password.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Not a problem, we can go ahead and take care of this today,&#8221; Michael replied. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go ahead and prompt your device with the steps to close out this ticket. Before I do that, I do highly suggest that you change your password in the settings app of your device.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The target said they weren&#8217;t sure exactly how to do that. Michael replied &#8220;no problem,&#8221; and then described how to change the account password, which the man said he did on his own device. At this point, the musician was still in control of his iCloud account.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Password is changed,&#8221; the man said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what that was, but I appreciate the call.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yup,&#8221; Michael replied, setting up the killer blow. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go ahead and prompt you with the next step to close out this ticket. Please give me one moment.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The target then received a text message that referenced information about his account, stating that he was in a support call with Michael. Included in the message was a link to a website that mimicked Apple&#8217;s iCloud login page &#8212; <strong>17505-apple[.]com</strong>. Once the target navigated to the phishing page, the video showed Perm&#8217;s screen in the upper right corner opening the phishing page from their end.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Oh okay, now I log in with my Apple ID?,&#8221; the man asked.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yup, then just follow the steps it requires, and if you need any help, just let me know,&#8221; Michael replied.</p>\n<p>As the victim typed in their Apple password and one-time passcode at the fake Apple site, Perm&#8217;s screen could be seen in the background logging into the victim&#8217;s iCloud account.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s unclear whether the phishers were able to steal any cryptocurrency from the victim in this case, who did not respond to requests for comment. However, shortly after this video was recorded, someone leaked several music recordings stolen from the victim&#8217;s iCloud account.</p>\n<p>At the conclusion of the call, Michael offered to configure the victim&#8217;s Apple profile so that any further changes to the account would need to happen in person at a physical Apple store. This appears to be one of several scripted ploys used by these voice phishers to gain and maintain the target&#8217;s confidence.</p>\n<p>A tutorial shared by Stotle titled &#8220;Social Engineering Script&#8221; includes a number of tips for scam callers that can help establish trust or a rapport with their prey.

However, new details about the internal operations of a prolific voice phishing gang show the group routinely abuses legitimate services at Apple and Google to force a variety of outbound communications to their users, including emails, automated phone calls and system-level messages sent to all signed-in devices.\n\nImage: Shutterstock, iHaMoo.\n\nKrebsOnSecurity recently told the saga of a cryptocurrency investor named Tony who was robbed of more than $4.7 million in an elaborate voice phishing attack. In Tony’s ordeal, the crooks appear to have initially contacted him via Google Assistant, an AI-based service that can engage in two-way conversations. The phishers also abused legitimate Google services to send Tony an email from google.com, and to send a Google account recovery prompt to all of his signed-in devices.\nToday’s story pivots off of Tony’s heist and new details shared by a scammer to explain how these voice phishing groups are abusing a legitimate Apple telephone support line to generate “account confirmation” message prompts from Apple to their customers.\nBefore we get to the Apple scam in detail, we need to revisit Tony’s case. The phishing domain used to steal roughly $4.7 million in cryptocurrencies from Tony was verify-trezor[.]io. This domain was featured in a writeup from February 2024 by the security firm Lookout, which found it was one of dozens being used by a prolific and audacious voice phishing group it dubbed “Crypto Chameleon.”\nCrypto Chameleon was brazenly trying to voice phish employees at the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC), as well as those working at the cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase and Binance. Lookout researchers discovered multiple voice phishing groups were using a new phishing kit that closely mimicked the single sign-on pages for Okta and other authentication providers.\nAs we’ll see in a moment, that phishing kit is operated and rented out by a cybercriminal known as “Perm” a.k.a. “Annie.” Perm is the current administrator of Star Fraud, one of the more consequential cybercrime communities on Telegram and one that has emerged as a foundry of innovation in voice phishing attacks.\nA review of the many messages that Perm posted to Star Fraud and other Telegram channels showed they worked closely with another cybercriminal who went by the handles “Aristotle” and just “Stotle.”\nIt is not clear what caused the rift, but at some point last year Stotle decided to turn on his erstwhile business partner Perm, sharing extremely detailed videos, tutorials and secrets that shed new light on how these phishing panels operate.\nStotle explained that the division of spoils from each robbery is decided in advance by all participants. Some co-conspirators will be paid a set fee for each call, while others are promised a percentage of any overall amount stolen. The person in charge of managing or renting out the phishing panel to others will generally take a percentage of each theft, which in Perm’s case is 10 percent.\nWhen the phishing group settles on a target of interest, the scammers will create and join a new Discord channel. This allows each logged on member to share what is currently on their screen, and these screens are tiled in a series of boxes so that everyone can see all other call participant screens at once.\nEach participant in the call has a specific role, including:\n-The Caller: The person speaking and trying to social engineer the target.\n‘OKAY, SO THIS REALLY IS APPLE’\nIn one video of a live voice phishing attack shared by Stotle, scammers using Perm’s panel targeted a musician in California. Throughout the video, we can see Perm monitoring the conversation and operating the phishing panel in the upper right corner of the screen.\n﻿\nIn the first step of the attack, they peppered the target’s Apple device with notifications from Apple by attempting to reset his password. Then a “Michael Keen” called him, spoofing Apple’s phone number and saying they were with Apple’s account recovery team.\nThe target told Michael that someone was trying to change his password, which Michael calmly explained they would investigate. Michael said he was going to send a prompt to the man’s device, and proceeded to place a call to an automated line that answered as Apple support saying, “I’d like to send a consent notification to your Apple devices. Do I have permission to do that?”\nIn this segment of the video, we can see the operator of the panel is calling the real Apple customer support phone number 800-275-2273, but they are doing so by spoofing the target’s phone number (the victim’s number is redacted in the video above). That’s because calling this support number from a phone number tied to an Apple account and selecting “1” for “yes” will then send an alert from Apple that displays the following message on all associated devices:\n\nCalling the Apple support number 800-275-2273 from a phone number tied to an Apple account will cause a prompt similar to this one to appear on all connected Apple devices.\n\nKrebsOnSecurity asked two different security firms to test this using the caller ID spoofing service shown in Perm’s video, and sure enough calling that 800 number for Apple by spoofing my phone number as the source caused the Apple Account Confirmation to pop up on all of my signed-in Apple devices.\nIn essence, the voice phishers are using an automated Apple phone support line to send notifications from Apple and to trick people into thinking they’re really talking with Apple. The phishing panel video leaked by Stotle shows this technique fooled the target, who felt completely at ease that he was talking to Apple after receiving the support prompt on his iPhone.\n“Okay, so this really is Apple,” the man said after receiving the alert from Apple. “Yeah, that’s definitely not me trying to reset my password.”\n“Not a problem, we can go ahead and take care of this today,” Michael replied. “I’ll go ahead and prompt your device with the steps to close out this ticket. Before I do that, I do highly suggest that you change your password in the settings app of your device.”\nThe target said they weren’t sure exactly how to do that. Michael replied “no problem,” and then described how to change the account password, which the man said he did on his own device. At this point, the musician was still in control of his iCloud account.\n“Password is changed,” the man said. “I don’t know what that was, but I appreciate the call.”\n“Yup,” Michael replied, setting up the killer blow. “I’ll go ahead and prompt you with the next step to close out this ticket. Please give me one moment.”\nThe target then received a text message that referenced information about his account, stating that he was in a support call with Michael. Included in the message was a link to a website that mimicked Apple’s iCloud login page — 17505-apple[.]com. Once the target navigated to the phishing page, the video showed Perm’s screen in the upper right corner opening the phishing page from their end.\n“Oh okay, now I log in with my Apple ID?,” the man asked.\n“Yup, then just follow the steps it requires, and if you need any help, just let me know,” Michael replied.\nAs the victim typed in their Apple password and one-time passcode at the fake Apple site, Perm’s screen could be seen in the background logging into the victim’s iCloud account.\nIt’s unclear whether the phishers were able to steal any cryptocurrency from the victim in this case, who did not respond to requests for comment. However, shortly after this video was recorded, someone leaked several music recordings stolen from the victim’s iCloud account.\nAt the conclusion of the call, Michael offered to configure the victim’s Apple profile so that any further changes to the account would need to happen in person at a physical Apple store. This appears to be one of several scripted ploys used by these voice phishers to gain and maintain the target’s confidence.\nA tutorial shared by Stotle titled “Social Engineering Script” includes a number of tips for scam callers that can help establish trust or a rapport with their prey. When the callers are impersonating Coinbase employees, for example, they will offer to sign the user up for the company’s free security email newsletter.\n“Also, for your security, we are able to subscribe you to Coinbase Bytes, which will basically give you updates to your email about data breaches and updates to your Coinbase account,” the script reads. “So we should have gone ahead and successfully subscribed you, and you should have gotten an email confirmation. Please let me know if that is the case. Alright, perfect.”\nIn reality, all they are doing is entering the target’s email address into Coinbase’s public email newsletter signup page, but it’s a remarkably effective technique because it demonstrates to the would-be victim that the caller has the ability to send emails from Coinbase.com.\nAsked to comment for this story, Apple said there has been no breach, hack, or technical exploit of iCloud or Apple services, and that the company is continuously adding new protections to address new and emerging threats. For example, it said it has implemented rate limiting for multi-factor authentication requests, which have been abused by voice phishing groups to impersonate Apple.\nApple said its representatives will never ask users to provide their password, device passcode, or two-factor authentication code or to enter it into a web page, even if it looks like an official Apple website. If a user receives a message or call that claims to be from Apple, here is what the user should expect.\n\nAUTODOXERS\nAccording to Stotle, the target lists used by their phishing callers originate mostly from a few crypto-related data breaches, including the 2022 and 2024 breaches involving user account data stolen from cryptocurrency hardware wallet vendor Trezor.\nPerm’s group and other crypto phishing gangs rely on a mix of homemade code and third-party data broker services to refine their target lists. Known as “autodoxers,” these tools help phishing gangs quickly automate the acquisition and/or verification of personal data on a target prior to each call attempt.\n\nOne “autodoxer” service advertised on Telegram that promotes a range of voice phishing tools and services.\n\nStotle said their autodoxer used a Telegram bot that leverages hacked accounts at consumer data brokers to gather a wealth of information about their targets, including their full Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, employer, and the names of family members.\nThe autodoxers are used to verify that each email address on a target list has an active account at Coinbase or another cryptocurrency exchange, ensuring that the attackers don’t waste time calling people who have no cryptocurrency to steal.\nSome of these autodoxer tools also will check the value of the target’s home address at property search services online, and then sort the target lists so that the wealthiest are at the top.\nCRYPTO THIEVES IN THE SHARK TANK\nStotle’s messages on Discord and Telegram show that a phishing group renting Perm’s panel voice-phished tens of thousands of dollars worth of cryptocurrency from the billionaire Mark Cuban.\n“I was an idiot,” Cuban told KrebsOnsecurity when asked about the June 2024 attack, which he first disclosed in a short-lived post on Twitter/X. “We were shooting Shark Tank and I was rushing between pitches.”\n\nImage: Shutterstock, ssi77.\n\nCuban said he first received a notice from Google that someone had tried to log in to his account. Then he got a call from what appeared to be a Google phone number. Cuban said he ignored several of these emails and calls until he decided they probably wouldn’t stop unless he answered.\n“So I answered, and wasn’t paying enough attention,” he said. “They asked for the circled number that comes up on the screen. Like a moron, I gave it to them, and they were in.”\nUnfortunately for Cuban, somewhere in his inbox were the secret “seed phrases” protecting two of his cryptocurrency accounts, and armed with those credentials the crooks were able to drain his funds. All told, the thieves managed to steal roughly $43,000 worth of cryptocurrencies from Cuban’s wallets — a relatively small heist for this crew.\n“They must have done some keyword searches,” once inside his Gmail account, Cuban said. “I had sent myself an email I had forgotten about that had my seed words for 2 accounts that weren’t very active any longer. I had moved almost everything but some smaller balances to Coinbase.”\nLIFE IS A GAME: MONEY IS HOW WE KEEP SCORE\nCybercriminals involved in voice phishing communities on Telegram are universally obsessed with their crypto holdings, mainly because in this community one’s demonstrable wealth is primarily what confers social status. It is not uncommon to see members sizing one another up using a verbal shorthand of “figs,” as in figures of crypto wealth.\nFor example, a low-level caller with no experience will sometimes be mockingly referred to as a 3fig or 3f, as in a person with less than $1,000 to their name. Salaries for callers are often also referenced this way, e.g. “Weekly salary: 5f.”\n\nThis meme shared by Stotle uses humor to depict an all-too-common pathway for voice phishing callers, who are often minors recruited from gaming networks like Minecraft and Roblox. The image that Lookout used in its blog post for Crypto Chameleon can be seen in the lower right hooded figure.\n\nVoice phishing groups frequently require new members to provide “proof of funds” — screenshots of their crypto holdings, ostensibly to demonstrate they are not penniless — before they’re allowed to join.\nThis proof of funds (POF) demand is typical among thieves selling high-dollar items, because it tends to cut down on the time-wasting inquiries from criminals who can’t afford what’s for sale anyway. But it has become so common in cybercrime communities that there are now several services designed to create fake POF images and videos, allowing customers to brag about large crypto holdings without actually possessing said wealth.\nSeveral of the phishing panel videos shared by Stotle feature audio that suggests co-conspirators were practicing responses to certain call scenarios, while other members of the phishing group critiqued them or tried disrupt their social engineering by being verbally abusive.\nThese groups will organize and operate for a few weeks, but tend to disintegrate when one member of the conspiracy decides to steal some or all of the loot, referred to in these communities as “snaking” others out of their agreed-upon sums.

Image: eBay Enterprise.\n\nMarch featured several investigations into the history of various people-search data broker services. One story exposed how the Belarusian CEO of the privacy and data removal service OneRep had actually founded dozens of people-search services, including many that OneRep was offering to remove people from for a fee. That story quickly prompted Mozilla to terminate its partnership with OneRep, which Mozilla had bundled as a privacy option for Firefox users.\nA story digging into the consumer data broker Radaris found its CEO was a fabricated identity, and that the company’s founders were Russian brothers in Massachusetts who operated multiple Russian language dating services and affiliate programs, in addition to a dizzying array of people-search websites.\nRadaris repeatedly threatened to sue KrebsOnSecurity unless that publication was retracted in full, alleging that it was replete with errors both factual and malicious. Instead, we doubled down and published all of the supporting evidence that wasn’t included in the original story, leaving little room for doubt about its conclusions. Fittingly, Radaris now pimps OneRep as a service when consumers request that their personal information be removed from the data broker’s website.\nEasily the longest story this year was an investigation into Stark Industries Solutions, a large, mysterious new Internet hosting firm that materialized when Russia invaded Ukraine. That piece revealed how Stark was being used as a global proxy network to conceal the true source of cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns against enemies of Russia.\n\nThe homepage of Stark Industries Solutions.\n\nMuch of my summer was spent reporting a story about how advertising and marketing firms have created a global free-for-all where anyone can track the daily movements and associations of hundreds of millions of mobile devices, thanks to the ubiquity of mobile location data that is broadly and cheaply available.\nResearch published in September explored the dark nexus between harm groups and cybercrime communities consumed with perpetrating financial fraud. That analysis found an increasing number of young, Western cybercriminals are also members of fast-growing online groups that exist solely to bully, stalk, harass and extort vulnerable teens into physically harming themselves and others.\nOne focus of that story was a Canadian cybercriminal who used the nickname Judische. Identified by the Mandiant as one of the most consequential threat actors of 2024, Judische was responsible for a hacking rampage that exposed private information on hundreds of millions of Americans.  That story withheld Judische’s real name, but the reporting came in handy in late October when a 25-year-old Canadian man named Connor Riley Moucka was arrested and charged with 20 criminal counts connected to the Snowflake data extortions.\n\nA surveillance photo of Connor Riley Moucka, a.k.a. “Judische” and “Waifu,” dated Oct 21, 2024, 9 days before Moucka’s arrest. This image was included in an affidavit filed by an investigator with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).\n\nIn November, KrebsOnSecurity published a profile of Judische’s accomplice — a hacker known as Kiberphant0m — detailing how Kiberphant0m had left a trail of clues strongly suggesting that they are or recently were a U.S. Army soldier stationed in South Korea.\nMy reporting in December was mainly split between two investigations. The first profiled Cryptomus, a dodgy cryptocurrency exchange allegedly based in Canada that has become a major payment processor and sanctions evasion platform for dozens of Russian exchanges and cybercrime services online.\nHow to Lose a Fortune with Just One Bad Click told the sad tales of two cryptocurrency heist victims who were scammed out of six and seven figures after falling for complex social engineering schemes over the phone. In these attacks, the phishers abused at least four different Google services to trick targets into believing they were speaking with a Google representative, and into giving thieves control over their account with a single click. Look for a story here in early 2025 that will explore the internal operations of these ruthless and ephemeral voice phishing gangs.\nBefore signing off for 2024, allow me to remind readers that the reporting we’re able to provide here is made possible primarily by the ads you may see at the top of this website.

A Google search on the phone number calling him &#8212; <strong>(650) 203-0000</strong> &#8212; revealed it was an official number for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Assistant\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Assistant</a>, an AI-based service that can engage in two-way conversations.</p>\n<p>At the same time, he received an email that came from a google.com email address, warning his Google account was compromised.

The attacker then sends an invitation to complete the form to themselves, not to their intended victim.</p>\n<p>&#8220;So, the attacker receives the invitation to fill out the form &#8211; and when they complete it, they enter their intended victim&#8217;s email address into the form, not their own,&#8221; Cluely <a href=\"https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/google-forms-used-call-back-phishing-scam\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote in a December 2023 post</a>. &#8220;The attackers are taking advantage of the fact that the emails are being sent out directly by Google Forms (from the google.com domain).

But he stopped after his taunting caused one of the scammers to start threatening him personally.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I probably shouldn&#8217;t have, but I recorded two 30-minute conversations with these guys,&#8221; Griffin said, acknowledging that maybe it wasn&#8217;t such a great idea to antagonize cybercriminals who clearly already knew everything about him. &#8220;One guy I talked to about his personal life, and then his friend called me up and said he was going to dox me and do all this other bad stuff. My FBI contact later told me not to talk to these guys anymore.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sound advice. So is hanging up whenever anyone calls you about a security problem with one of your accounts. Even security-conscious people tend to underestimate the complex and shifting threat from phone-based phishing scams, but they do so at their peril.</p>\n<p>When in doubt: <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/04/when-in-doubt-hang-up-look-up-call-back/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hang up, look up, and call back</a>. If your response to these types of calls involves anything other than hanging up, researching the correct phone number, and contacting the entity that claims to be calling, you may be setting yourself up for a costly and humbling learning experience.</p>\n<p>Understand that your email credentials <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/06/the-value-of-a-hacked-email-account/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">are more than likely the key to unlocking your entire digital identity</a>. Be sure to use a long, unique passphrase for your email address, and never pick a passphrase that you have ever used anywhere else (not even a variation on an old password).</p>\n<p>Finally, it&#8217;s also a good idea to take advantage of the strongest multi-factor authentication methods offered. For Gmail/Google accounts, that includes <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/07/google-security-keys-neutralized-employee-phishing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the use of passkeys or physical security keys</a>, which are heavily phishing resistant.

A scammer called using a real Google phone number to warn his Gmail account was being hacked, sent email security alerts directly from google.com, and ultimately seized control over the account by convincing him to click “yes” to a Google prompt on his mobile device.\nGriffin is a battalion chief firefighter in the Seattle area, and on May 6 he received a call from someone claiming they were from Google support saying his account was being accessed from Germany. A Google search on the phone number calling him — (650) 203-0000 — revealed it was an official number for Google Assistant, an AI-based service that can engage in two-way conversations.\nAt the same time, he received an email that came from a google.com email address, warning his Google account was compromised. The message included a “Google Support Case ID number” and information about the Google representative supposedly talking to him on the phone, stating the rep’s name as “Ashton” — the same name given by the caller.\nGriffin didn’t learn this until much later, but the email he received had a real google.com address because it was sent via Google Forms, a service available to all Google Docs users that makes it easy to send surveys, quizzes and other communications.\n\nA phony security alert Griffin received prior to his bitcoin heist, via Google Forms.\n\nAccording to tripwire.com’s Graham Cluely, phishers will use Google Forms to create a security alert message, and then change the form’s settings to automatically send a copy of the completed form to any email address entered into the form. The attacker then sends an invitation to complete the form to themselves, not to their intended victim.\n“So, the attacker receives the invitation to fill out the form – and when they complete it, they enter their intended victim’s email address into the form, not their own,” Cluely wrote in a December 2023 post. “The attackers are taking advantage of the fact that the emails are being sent out directly by Google Forms (from the google.com domain). It’s an established legitimate domain that helps to make the email look more legitimate and is less likely to be intercepted en route by email-filtering solutions.”\nThe fake Google representative was polite, patient, professional and reassuring. Ashton told Griffin he was going to receive a notification that would allow him to regain control of the account from the hackers. Sure enough, a Google prompt instantly appeared on his phone asking, “Is it you trying to recover your account?”\n\nAdam Griffin clicked “yes,” to an account recovery notification similar to this one on May 6.\n\nGriffin said that after receiving the pop-up prompt from Google on his phone, he felt more at ease that he really was talking to someone at Google. In reality, the thieves caused the alert to appear on his phone merely by stepping through Google’s account recovery process for Griffin’s Gmail address.\n“As soon as I clicked yes, I gave them access to my Gmail, which was synched to Google Photos,” Griffin said.\nUnfortunately for Griffin, years ago he used Google Photos to store an image of the secret seed phrase that was protecting his cryptocurrency wallet. Armed with that phrase, the phishers could drain all of his funds.\n“From there they were able to transfer approximately $450,000 out of my Exodus wallet,” Griffin recalled.\nGriffin said just minutes after giving away access to his Gmail account he received a call from someone claiming to be with Coinbase, who likewise told him someone in Germany was trying to take over his account.\nGriffin said a follow-up investigation revealed the attackers had used his Gmail account to gain access to his Coinbase account from a VPN connection in California, providing the multi-factor code from his Google Authenticator app. Unbeknownst to him at the time, Google Authenticator by default also makes the same codes available in one’s Google account online.\nBut when the thieves tried to move $100,000 worth of cryptocurrency out of his account, Coinbase sent an email stating that the account had been locked, and that he would have to submit additional verification documents before he could do anything with it.\nGRAND THEFT AUTOMATED\nJust days after Griffin was robbed, a scammer impersonating Google managed to phish 45 bitcoins — approximately $4,725,000 at today’s value — from Tony, a 42-year-old professional from northern California. Tony agreed to speak about his harrowing experience on condition that his last name not be used.\nTony got into bitcoin back in 2013 and has been investing in it ever since. On the evening of May 15, 2024, Tony was putting his three- and one-year-old boys to bed when he received a message from Google about an account security issue, followed by a phone call from a “Daniel Alexander” at Google who said his account was compromised by hackers.\nTony said he had just signed up for Google’s Gemini AI (an artificial intelligence platform formerly known as “Bard”), and mistakenly believed the call was part of that service. Daniel told Tony his account was being accessed by someone in Frankfurt, Germany, and that he could evict the hacker and recover access to the account by clicking “yes” to the prompt that Google was going to send to his phone.\nThe Google prompt arrived seconds later.

My FBI contact later told me not to talk to these guys anymore.”\nSound advice. So is hanging up whenever anyone calls you about a security problem with one of your accounts. Even security-conscious people tend to underestimate the complex and shifting threat from phone-based phishing scams, but they do so at their peril.\nWhen in doubt: Hang up, look up, and call back. If your response to these types of calls involves anything other than hanging up, researching the correct phone number, and contacting the entity that claims to be calling, you may be setting yourself up for a costly and humbling learning experience.\nUnderstand that your email credentials are more than likely the key to unlocking your entire digital identity. Be sure to use a long, unique passphrase for your email address, and never pick a passphrase that you have ever used anywhere else (not even a variation on an old password).\nFinally, it’s also a good idea to take advantage of the strongest multi-factor authentication methods offered. For Gmail/Google accounts, that includes the use of passkeys or physical security keys, which are heavily phishing resistant. For Google users holding measurable sums of cryptocurrency, the most secure option is Google’s free Advanced Protection program, which includes more extensive account security features but also comes with some serious convenience trade-offs.","dc:creator":"BrianKrebs","comments":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/12/how-to-lose-a-fortune-with-just-one-bad-click/#comments","content":"Adam Griffin is still in disbelief over how quickly he was robbed of nearly $500,000 in cryptocurrencies.

Ms. Krychka was recently appointed the director of several other new U.K. firms, including an entity created in February 2024 called Globopay UAB Ltd, and another called WS Management and Advisory Corporation Ltd. Ms. Krychka did not respond to a request for comment.\nWS Management and Advisory Corporation bills itself as the regulatory body that exclusively oversees licenses of cryptocurrencies in the jurisdiction of Western Sahara, a disputed territory in northwest Africa. Its website says the company assists applicants with bank setup and formation, online gaming licenses, and the creation and licensing of foreign exchange brokers. One of Certa Payments’ former websites — certa[.]website — also shared a server with 12 other domains, including rasd-state[.]ws, a website for the Central Reserve Authority of the Western Sahara.\n\nThe website crasadr dot com, the official website of the Central Reserve Authority of Western Sahara.\n\nThis business registry from the Czech Republic indicates Ms. Krychka works as a director at an advertising and marketing firm called Icon Tech SRO, which was previously named Blaven Technologies (Blaven’s website says it is an online payment service provider).\nIn August 2024, Icon Tech changed its name again to Mezhundarondnaya IBU SRO, which describes itself as an “experienced company in IT consulting” that is based in Armenia. The same registry says Ms. Krychka is somehow also a director at a Turkish investment venture. So much business acumen at such a young age!\nFor now, Canada remains an attractive location for cryptocurrency businesses to set up shop, at least on paper. The IJF and CTV News found that as of February 2024, there were just over 3,000 actively registered MSBs in Canada, 1,247 of which were located at the same building as at least one other MSB.\n“That analysis does not include the roughly 2,700 MSBs whose registrations have lapsed, been revoked or otherwise stopped,” they observed. “If they are included, then a staggering 2,061 out of 5,705 total MSBs share a building with at least one other MSB.”","dc:creator":"BrianKrebs","comments":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/12/how-cryptocurrency-turns-to-cash-in-russian-banks/#comments","content":"A financial firm registered in Canada has emerged as the payment processor for dozens of Russian cryptocurrency exchanges and websites hawking cybercrime services aimed at Russian-speaking customers, new research finds.

However, Vars_Secc would be banned from XSS after attempting to sell access to the Russian telecommunications giant <strong>Rostelecom</strong>. [In this, Vars_Secc violated the Number One Rule for operating on a Russia-based crime forum: Never offer to hack or sell data stolen from Russian entities or citizens].</p>\n<p>On June 20, 2023, Vars_Secc posted a sales thread on the cybercrime forum <strong>Ramp 2.0</strong> titled, &#8220;Selling US Gov Financial Access.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Server within the network, possible to pivot,&#8221; Vars_Secc&#8217;s sparse sales post read. &#8220;Has 3-5 subroutes connected to it.

However, this person’s identity may not remain a secret for long: A careful review of Kiberphant0m’s daily chats across multiple cybercrime personas suggests they are a U.S. Army soldier who is or was recently stationed in South Korea.\nKiberphant0m’s identities on cybercrime forums and on Telegram and Discord chat channels have been selling data stolen from customers of the cloud data storage company Snowflake. At the end of 2023, malicious hackers discovered that many companies had uploaded huge volumes of sensitive customer data to Snowflake accounts that were protected with nothing more than a username and password (no multi-factor authentication required).\nAfter scouring darknet markets for stolen Snowflake account credentials, the hackers began raiding the data storage repositories for some of the world’s largest corporations. Among those was AT&T, which disclosed in July that cybercriminals had stolen personal information, phone and text message records for roughly 110 million people.  Wired.com reported in July that AT&T paid a hacker $370,000 to delete stolen phone records.\nOn October 30, Canadian authorities arrested Alexander Moucka, a.k.a. Connor Riley Moucka of Kitchener, Ontario, on a provisional arrest warrant from the United States, which has since indicted him on 20 criminal counts connected to the Snowflake breaches. Another suspect in the Snowflake hacks, John Erin Binns, is an American who is currently incarcerated in Turkey.\n\nA surveillance photo of Connor Riley Moucka, a.k.a. “Judische” and “Waifu,” dated Oct 21, 2024, 9 days before Moucka’s arrest. This image was included in an affidavit filed by an investigator with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).\n\nInvestigators say Moucka, who went by the handles Judische and Waifu, had tasked Kiberphant0m with selling data stolen from Snowflake customers who refused to pay a ransom to have their information deleted. Immediately after news broke of Moucka’s arrest, Kiberphant0m was clearly furious, and posted on the hacker community BreachForums what they claimed were the AT&T call logs for President-elect Donald J. Trump and for Vice President Kamala Harris.\n“In the event you do not reach out to us @ATNT all presidential government call logs will be leaked,” Kiberphant0m threatened, signing their post with multiple “#FREEWAIFU” tags. “You don’t think we don’t have plans in the event of an arrest? Think again.”\nOn the same day, Kiberphant0m posted what they claimed was the “data schema” from the U.S. National Security Agency.\n“This was obtained from the ATNT Snowflake hack which is why ATNT paid an extortion,” Kiberphant0m wrote in a thread on BreachForums. “Why would ATNT pay Waifu for the data when they wouldn’t even pay an extortion for over 20M+ SSNs?”\n\nKiberphant0m posting what he claimed was a “data schema” stolen from the NSA via AT&T.\n\nAlso on Nov. 5, Kiberphant0m offered call logs stolen from Verizon’s push-to-talk (PTT) customers — mainly U.S. government agencies and emergency first responders. On Nov. 9, Kiberphant0m posted a sales thread on BreachForums offering a “SIM-swapping” service targeting Verizon PTT customers. In a SIM-swap, fraudsters use credentials that are phished or stolen from mobile phone company employees to divert a target’s phone calls and text messages to a device they control.\nMEET ‘BUTTHOLIO’\nKiberphant0m joined BreachForums in January 2024, but their public utterances on Discord and Telegram channels date back to at least early 2022. On their first post to BreachForums, Kiberphant0m said they could be reached at the Telegram handle @cyb3rph4nt0m.\nA review of @cyb3rph4nt0m shows this user has posted more than 4,200 messages since January 2024. Many of these messages were attempts to recruit people who could be hired to deploy a piece of malware that enslaved host machines in an Internet of Things (IoT) botnet.\nOn BreachForums, Kiberphant0m has sold the source code to “Shi-Bot,” a custom Linux DDoS botnet based on the Mirai malware. Kiberphant0m had few sales threads on BreachForums prior to the Snowflake attacks becoming public in May, and many of those involved databases stolen from companies in South Korea.\nOn June 5, 2024, a Telegram user by the name “Buttholio” joined the fraud-focused Telegram channel “Comgirl” and claimed to be Kiberphant0m. Buttholio made the claim after being taunted as a nobody by another denizen of Comgirl, referring to their @cyb3rph4nt0m account on Telegram and the Kiberphant0m user on cybercrime forums.\n“Type ‘kiberphant0m’ on google with the quotes,” Buttholio told another user. “I’ll wait. Go ahead. Over 50 articles. 15+ telecoms breached. I got the IMSI number to every single person that’s ever registered in Verizon, Tmobile, ATNT and Verifone.”\nOn Sept. 17, 2023, Buttholio posted in a Discord chat room dedicated to players of the video game Escape from Tarkov. “Come to Korea, servers there is pretty much no extract camper or cheater,” Buttholio advised.\nIn another message that same day in the gaming Discord, Buttholio told others they bought the game in the United States, but that they were playing it in Asia.\n“USA is where the game was purchased from, server location is actual in game servers u play on. I am a u.s. soldier so i bought it in the states but got on rotation so i have to use asian servers,” they shared.\n‘REVERSESHELL’\nThe account @Kiberphant0m was assigned the Telegram ID number 6953392511. A review of this ID at the cyber intelligence platform Flashpoint shows that on January 4, 2024 Kibertphant0m posted to the Telegram channel “Dstat,” which is populated by cybercriminals involved in launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and selling DDoS-for-hire services [Full disclosure: Flashpoint is currently an advertiser on this website].\nImmediately after Kiberphant0m logged on to the Dstat channel, another user wrote “hi buttholio,” to which Kiberphant0m replied with an affirmative greeting “wsg,” or “what’s good.” On Nov. 1, Dstat’s website dstat[.]cc was seized as part of “Operation PowerOFF,” an international law enforcement action against DDoS services.\nFlashpoint’s data shows that @kiberphant0m told a fellow member of Dstat on April 10, 2024 that their alternate Telegram username was “@reverseshell,” and did the same two weeks later in the Telegram chat The Jacuzzi. The Telegram ID for this account is 5408575119.\nWay back on Nov. 15, 2022, @reverseshell told a fellow member of a Telegram channel called Cecilio Chat that they were a soldier in the U.S. Army. This user also shared the following image of someone pictured waist-down in military fatigues, with a camouflaged backpack at their feet:\n\nKiberphant0m’s apparent alias ReverseShell posted this image on a Telegram channel Cecilio Chat, on Nov. 15, 2022. Image: Flashpoint.\n\nIn September 2022, Reverseshell was embroiled in an argument with another member who had threatened to launch a DDoS attack against Reverseshell’s Internet address. After the promised attack materialized, Reverseshell responded, “Yall just hit military base contracted wifi.”\nIn a chat from October 2022, Reverseshell was bragging about the speed of the servers they were using, and in reply to another member’s question said that they were accessing the Internet via South Korea Telecom.\nTelegram chat logs archived by Flashpoint show that on Aug. 23, 2022, Reverseshell bragged they’d been using automated tools to find valid logins for Internet servers that they resold to others.\n“I’ve hit US gov servers with default creds,” Reverseshell wrote, referring to systems with easy-to-guess usernames and/or passwords. “Telecom control servers, machinery shops, Russian ISP servers, etc. I sold a few big companies for like $2-3k a piece. You can sell the access when you get a big SSH into corporation.”\nOn July 29, 2023, Reverseshell posted a screenshot of a login page for a major U.S. defense contractor, claiming they had an aerospace company’s credentials to sell.\nPROMAN AND VARS_SECC\nFlashpoint finds the Telegram ID 5408575119 has used several aliases since 2022, including Reverseshell and Proman557.\nA search on the username Proman557 at the cyber intelligence platform Intel 471 shows that a hacker by the name “Proman554” registered on Hackforums in September 2022, and in messages to other users Proman554 said they can be reached at the Telegram account Buttholio.\nIntel 471 also finds the Proman557 moniker is one of many used by a person on the Russian-language hacking forum Exploit in 2022 who sold a variety of Linux-based botnet malware.\nProman557 was eventually banned — allegedly for scamming a fellow member out of $350 — and the Exploit moderator warned forum users that Proman557 had previously registered under several other nicknames, including an account called “Vars_Secc.”\nVars_Secc’s thousands of comments on Telegram over two years show this user divided their time between online gaming, maintaining a DDoS botnet, and promoting the sale or renting of their botnets to other users.\n“I use ddos for many things not just to be a skid,” Vars_Secc pronounced. “Why do you think I haven’t sold my net?” They then proceeded to list the most useful qualities of their botnet:\n-I use it to hit off servers that ban me or piss me off\n\nFlashpoint shows that in June 2023, Vars_Secc responded to taunting from a fellow member in the Telegram channel SecHub who had threatened to reveal their personal details to the federal government for a reward.\n“Man I’ve been doing this shit for 4 years,” Vars_Secc replied nonchalantly. “I highly doubt the government is going to pay millions of dollars for data on some random dude operating a pointless ddos botnet and finding a few vulnerabilities here and there.”\nFor several months in 2023, Vars_Secc also was an active member of the Russian-language crime forum XSS, where they sold access to a U.S. government server for $2,000. However, Vars_Secc would be banned from XSS after attempting to sell access to the Russian telecommunications giant Rostelecom. [In this, Vars_Secc violated the Number One Rule for operating on a Russia-based crime forum: Never offer to hack or sell data stolen from Russian entities or citizens].\nOn June 20, 2023, Vars_Secc posted a sales thread on the cybercrime forum Ramp 2.0 titled, “Selling US Gov Financial Access.”\n“Server within the network, possible to pivot,” Vars_Secc’s sparse sales post read. “Has 3-5 subroutes connected to it. Price $1,250. Telegram: Vars_Secc.”\nVars_Secc also used Ramp in June 2023 to sell access to a “Vietnam government Internet Network Information Center.”\n“Selling access server allocated within the network,” Vars_Secc wrote. “Has some data on it. $500.”\nBUG BOUNTIES\nThe Vars_Secc identity claimed on Telegram in May 2023 that they made money by submitting reports about software flaws to HackerOne, a company that helps technology firms field reports about security vulnerabilities in their products and services. Specifically, Vars_Secc said they had earned financial rewards or “bug bounties” from reddit.com, the U.S. Department of Defense, and Coinbase, among 30 others.\n“I make money off bug bounties, it’s quite simple,” Vars_Secc said when asked what they do for a living. “That’s why I have over 30 bug bounty reports on HackerOne.”\nA month before that, Vars_Secc said they’d found a vulnerability in reddit.com.\n“I poisoned Reddit’s cache,” they explained. “I’m going to exploit it further, then report it to reddit.”\nKrebsOnSecurity sought comment from HackerOne, which said it would investigate the claims. This story will be updated if they respond.\nThe Vars_Secc telegram handle also has claimed ownership of the BreachForums member “Boxfan,” and Intel 471 shows Boxfan’s early posts on the forum had the Vars_Secc Telegram account in their signature. In their most recent post to BreachForums in January 2024, Boxfan disclosed a security vulnerability they found in Naver, the most popular search engine in South Korea (according to statista.com). Boxfan’s comments suggest they have strong negative feelings about South Korean culture.\n“Have fun exploiting this vulnerability,” Boxfan wrote on BreachForums, after pasting a long string of computer code intended to demonstrate the flaw. “Fuck you South Korea and your discriminatory views. Nobody likes ur shit kpop you evil fucks. Whoever can dump this DB [database] congrats. I don’t feel like doing it so I’ll post it to the forum.”\nThe many identities tied to Kiberphant0m strongly suggest they are or until recently were a U.S. Army soldier stationed in South Korea.

The company employs more than 7,000 people and serves approximately 8,100 financial institutions around the world. A major part of Finastra&#8217;s day-to-day business involves processing huge volumes of digital files containing instructions for wire and bank transfers on behalf of its clients.</p>\n<p>On November 8, 2024, Finastra notified financial institution customers that on Nov. 7 its security team detected suspicious activity on Finastra&#8217;s internally hosted file transfer platform. Finastra also told customers that someone had begun selling large volumes of files allegedly stolen from its systems.</p>\n<p>&#8220;On November 8, a threat actor communicated on the dark web claiming to have data exfiltrated from this platform,&#8221; reads <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/finastra-notice.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Finastra&#8217;s disclosure</a>, a copy of which was shared by a source at one of the customer firms.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There is no direct impact on customer operations, our customers&#8217; systems, or Finastra&#8217;s ability to serve our customers currently,&#8221; the notice continued. &#8220;We have implemented an alternative secure file sharing platform to ensure continuity, and investigations are ongoing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But its notice to customers does indicate the intruder managed to extract or &#8220;exfiltrate&#8221; an unspecified volume of customer data.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The threat actor did not deploy malware or tamper with any customer files within the environment,&#8221; the notice reads. &#8220;Furthermore, no files other than the exfiltrated files were viewed or accessed. We remain focused on determining the scope and nature of the data contained within the exfiltrated files.&#8221;<span id=\"more-69538\"></span></p>\n<p>In a written statement in response to questions about the incident, Finastra said it has been &#8220;actively and transparently responding to our customers’ questions and keeping them informed about what we do and do not yet know about the data that was posted.&#8221; The company also shared an updated communication to its clients, which said while it was still investigating the root cause, &#8220;initial evidence points to credentials that were compromised.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Additionally, we have been sharing Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and our CISO has been speaking directly with our customers’ security teams to provide updates on the investigation and our eDiscovery process,&#8221; the statement continues. Here is the rest of what they shared:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;In terms of eDiscovery, we are analyzing the data to determine what specific customers were affected, while simultaneously assessing and communicating which of our products are not dependent on the specific version of the SFTP platform that was compromised. The impacted SFTP platform is not used by all customers and is not the default platform used by Finastra or its customers to exchange data files associated with a broad suite of our products, so we are working as quickly as possible to rule out affected customers. However, as you can imagine, this is a time-intensive process because we have many large customers that leverage different Finastra products in different parts of their business. We are prioritizing accuracy and transparency in our communications.</p>\n<p>Importantly, for any customers who are deemed to be affected, we will be reaching out and working with them directly.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>On Nov. 8, a cybercriminal using the nickname &#8220;<strong>abyss0</strong>&#8221; posted on the English-language cybercrime community <strong>BreachForums</strong> that they&#8217;d stolen files belonging to some of Finastra&#8217;s largest banking clients. The data auction did not specify a starting or &#8220;buy it now&#8221; price, but said interested buyers should reach out to them on Telegram.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69542\" style=\"width: 760px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/finastra-sales-nov8.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69542\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-69542\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/finastra-sales-nov8.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"489\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/finastra-sales-nov8.png 1052w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/finastra-sales-nov8-768x500.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/finastra-sales-nov8-782x509.png 782w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-69542\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">abyss0&#8217;s Nov. 7 sales thread on BreachForums included many screenshots showing the file directory listings for various Finastra customers.

A review of abyss0&#8217;s posts to BreachForums reveals this user has offered to sell databases stolen in several dozen other breaches advertised over the past six months.</p>\n<p>The apparent timeline of this breach suggests abyss0 gained access to Finastra&#8217;s file sharing system at least a week before the company says it first detected suspicious activity, and that the Nov. 7 activity cited by Finastra may have been the intruder returning to exfiltrate more data.</p>\n<p>Maybe abyss0 found a buyer who paid for their early retirement. We may never know, because this person has effectively vanished. The Telegram account that abyss0 listed in their sales thread appears to have been suspended or deleted. Likewise, abyss0&#8217;s account on BreachForums no longer exists, and all of their sales threads have since disappeared.</p>\n<p>It seems improbable that both Telegram and BreachForums would have given this user the boot at the same time. The simplest explanation is that something spooked abyss0 enough for them to abandon a number of pending sales opportunities, in addition to a well-manicured cybercrime persona.</p>\n<p>In March 2020, Finastra <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/03/security-breach-disrupts-fintech-firm-finastra/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">suffered a ransomware attack</a> that sidelined a number of the company&#8217;s core businesses for days.

Finastra, which provides software and services to 45 of the world’s top 50 banks, notified customers of the security incident after a cybercriminal began selling more than 400 gigabytes of data purportedly stolen from the company.\n\nLondon-based Finastra has offices in 42 countries and reported $1.9 billion in revenues last year. The company employs more than 7,000 people and serves approximately 8,100 financial institutions around the world. A major part of Finastra’s day-to-day business involves processing huge volumes of digital files containing instructions for wire and bank transfers on behalf of its clients.\nOn November 8, 2024, Finastra notified financial institution customers that on Nov. 7 its security team detected suspicious activity on Finastra’s internally hosted file transfer platform. Finastra also told customers that someone had begun selling large volumes of files allegedly stolen from its systems.\n“On November 8, a threat actor communicated on the dark web claiming to have data exfiltrated from this platform,” reads Finastra’s disclosure, a copy of which was shared by a source at one of the customer firms.\n“There is no direct impact on customer operations, our customers’ systems, or Finastra’s ability to serve our customers currently,” the notice continued. “We have implemented an alternative secure file sharing platform to ensure continuity, and investigations are ongoing.”\nBut its notice to customers does indicate the intruder managed to extract or “exfiltrate” an unspecified volume of customer data.\n“The threat actor did not deploy malware or tamper with any customer files within the environment,” the notice reads. “Furthermore, no files other than the exfiltrated files were viewed or accessed. We remain focused on determining the scope and nature of the data contained within the exfiltrated files.”\nIn a written statement in response to questions about the incident, Finastra said it has been “actively and transparently responding to our customers’ questions and keeping them informed about what we do and do not yet know about the data that was posted.” The company also shared an updated communication to its clients, which said while it was still investigating the root cause, “initial evidence points to credentials that were compromised.”\n“Additionally, we have been sharing Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and our CISO has been speaking directly with our customers’ security teams to provide updates on the investigation and our eDiscovery process,” the statement continues. Here is the rest of what they shared:\n“In terms of eDiscovery, we are analyzing the data to determine what specific customers were affected, while simultaneously assessing and communicating which of our products are not dependent on the specific version of the SFTP platform that was compromised. The impacted SFTP platform is not used by all customers and is not the default platform used by Finastra or its customers to exchange data files associated with a broad suite of our products, so we are working as quickly as possible to rule out affected customers. However, as you can imagine, this is a time-intensive process because we have many large customers that leverage different Finastra products in different parts of their business. We are prioritizing accuracy and transparency in our communications.\nImportantly, for any customers who are deemed to be affected, we will be reaching out and working with them directly.”\n\nOn Nov. 8, a cybercriminal using the nickname “abyss0” posted on the English-language cybercrime community BreachForums that they’d stolen files belonging to some of Finastra’s largest banking clients. The data auction did not specify a starting or “buy it now” price, but said interested buyers should reach out to them on Telegram.\n\nabyss0’s Nov. 7 sales thread on BreachForums included many screenshots showing the file directory listings for various Finastra customers. Image: Ke-la.com.\n\nAccording to screenshots collected by the cyber intelligence platform Ke-la.com, abyss0 first attempted to sell the data allegedly stolen from Finastra on October 31, but that earlier sales thread did not name the victim company. However, it did reference many of the same banks called out as Finastra customers in the Nov. 8 post on BreachForums.\n\nThe original October 31 post from abyss0, where they advertise the sale of data from several large banks that are customers of a large financial software company. Image: Ke-la.com.\n\nThe October sales thread also included a starting price: $20,000. By Nov. 3, that price had been reduced to $10,000. A review of abyss0’s posts to BreachForums reveals this user has offered to sell databases stolen in several dozen other breaches advertised over the past six months.\nThe apparent timeline of this breach suggests abyss0 gained access to Finastra’s file sharing system at least a week before the company says it first detected suspicious activity, and that the Nov. 7 activity cited by Finastra may have been the intruder returning to exfiltrate more data.\nMaybe abyss0 found a buyer who paid for their early retirement. We may never know, because this person has effectively vanished. The Telegram account that abyss0 listed in their sales thread appears to have been suspended or deleted. Likewise, abyss0’s account on BreachForums no longer exists, and all of their sales threads have since disappeared.\nIt seems improbable that both Telegram and BreachForums would have given this user the boot at the same time. The simplest explanation is that something spooked abyss0 enough for them to abandon a number of pending sales opportunities, in addition to a well-manicured cybercrime persona.\nIn March 2020, Finastra suffered a ransomware attack that sidelined a number of the company’s core businesses for days. According to reporting from Bloomberg, Finastra was able to recover from that incident without paying a ransom.\nThis is a developing story. Updates will be noted with timestamps.

Over the last nine months, I’ve reached out to CISA (the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency) over a dozen times about .gov email addresses that were compromised and that CISA was unaware of.”","dc:creator":"BrianKrebs","comments":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/11/fbi-spike-in-hacked-police-emails-fake-subpoenas/#comments","content":"The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is urging police departments and governments worldwide to beef up security around their email systems, citing a recent increase in cybercriminal services that use hacked police email accounts to sen [...]","contentSnippet":"The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is urging police departments and governments worldwide to beef up security around their email systems, citing a recent increase in cybercriminal services that use hacked police email accounts to send unauthorized subpoenas and customer data requests to U.S.-based technology companies.","guid":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/?p=69445","categories":["A Little Sunshine","Latest Warnings","The Coming Storm","Web Fraud 2.0","emergency data request","fake EDR","fbi","Kodex","Matt Donahue","pwnstar"],"isoDate":"2024-11-09T19:20:26.000Z","tag":"news"},{"creator":"BrianKrebs","title":"Canadian Man Arrested in Snowflake Data Extortions","link":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/11/canadian-man-arrested-in-snowflake-data-extortions/","pubDate":"Tue, 05 Nov 2024 17:10:04 +0000","content:encoded":"<p>A 25-year-old man in Ontario, Canada has been arrested for allegedly stealing data from and extorting more than 160 companies that used the cloud data service <strong>Snowflake</strong>.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_69434\" style=\"width: 758px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-69434\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-69434\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/snowflaking.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"748\" height=\"432\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/snowflaking.png 983w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/snowflaking-768x443.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/snowflaking-782x451.png 782w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-69434\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image: https://www.pomerium.com/blog/the-real-lessons-from-the-snowflake-breach</p></div>\n<p>On October 30, Canadian authorities arrested <strong>Alexander Moucka, </strong>a.k.a.<strong> Connor Riley Moucka </strong>of Kitchener, Ontario, on a provisional arrest warrant from the United States. Bloomberg first <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-05/hacker-said-to-be-behind-breach-of-snowflake-customers-arrested?embedded-checkout=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a> Moucka&#8217;s alleged ties to the Snowflake hacks on Monday.</p>\n<p>At the end of 2023, malicious hackers learned that many large companies had uploaded huge volumes of sensitive customer data to Snowflake accounts that were protected with little more than a username and password (no multi-factor authentication required). After scouring darknet markets for stolen Snowflake account credentials, the hackers began raiding the data storage repositories used by some of the world’s largest corporations.</p>\n<p>Among those was <strong>AT&amp;T</strong>, which <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/07/hackers-steal-phone-sms-records-for-nearly-all-att-customers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">disclosed in July</a> that cybercriminals had stolen personal information and phone and text message records for roughly 110 million people — nearly all of its customers. <strong>Wired.com</strong> <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/atandt-paid-hacker-300000-to-delete-stolen-call-records/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported in July</a> that AT&amp;T paid a hacker $370,000 to delete stolen phone records.</p>\n<p>A report on the extortion attacks from the incident response firm <strong>Mandiant</strong> notes that Snowflake victim companies were privately approached by the hackers, who demanded a ransom in exchange for a promise not to sell or leak the stolen data. All told, more than 160 Snowflake customers were relieved of data, including <strong>TicketMaster</strong>, <strong>Lending Tree</strong>, <strong>Advance Auto Parts</strong> and <strong>Neiman Marcus</strong>.</p>\n<p>Moucka is alleged to have used the hacker handles <strong>Judische</strong> and <strong>Waifu</strong>, among many others. These monikers correspond to a prolific cybercriminal whose exploits were the subject of <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/09/the-dark-nexus-between-harm-groups-and-the-com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a recent story published here</a> about the overlap between Western, English-speaking cybercriminals and extremist groups that harass and extort minors into harming themselves or others.</p>\n<p>On May 2, 2024, Judische claimed on the fraud-focused Telegram channel <strong>Star Chat</strong> that they had hacked <strong>Santander Bank</strong>, one of the first known Snowflake victims. Judische would repeat that claim in Star Chat on May 13 — the day before Santander publicly disclosed a data breach — and would periodically blurt out the names of other Snowflake victims before their data even went up for sale on the cybercrime forums.</p>\n<p>404 Media <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/alleged-snowflake-hacker-appears-in-court-says-prison-in-lockdown/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reports</a> that at a court hearing in Ontario this morning, Moucka called in from a prison phone and said he was seeking legal aid to hire an attorney.</p>\n<h2>TELECOM DOMINOES</h2>\n<p>Mandiant has attributed the Snowflake compromises to a group it calls “<strong>UNC5537</strong>,” with members based in North America and <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/08/t-mobile-investigating-claims-of-massive-data-breach/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Turkey</a>. Sources close to the investigation tell KrebsOnSecurity the UNC5537 member in Turkey is <strong>John Erin Binns</strong>, an elusive American man indicted by the <strong>U.S. Department of Justice</strong> (DOJ) for <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/08/t-mobile-investigating-claims-of-massive-data-breach/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a 2021 breach at T-Mobile</a> that exposed the personal information of at least 76.6 million customers.</p>\n<p><strong>Update</strong>: The Justice Department has <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">unsealed an indictment</a> (PDF) against Moucka and Binns, charging them with one count of conspiracy; 10 counts of wire fraud; four counts of computer fraud and abuse; two counts of extortion in relation to computer fraud; and two counts aggravated identity theft.</p>\n<p>In a statement on Moucka&#8217;s arrest, Mandiant said UNC5537 aka Alexander ‘Connor’ Moucka has proven to be one of the most consequential threat actors of 2024.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In April 2024, UNC5537 launched a campaign, systematically compromising misconfigured SaaS instances across over a hundred organizations,&#8221; wrote <strong>Austin Larsen</strong>, Mandiant&#8217;s senior threat analyst. &#8220;The operation, which left organizations reeling from significant data loss and extortion attempts, highlighted the alarming scale of harm an individual can cause using off-the-shelf tools.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sources involved in the investigation said UNC5537 has focused on hacking into telecommunications companies around the world. Those sources told KrebsOnSecurity that Binns and Judische are suspected of <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/bsnl-suffers-second-data-breach-in-six-months/articleshow/111264707.cms?from=mdr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stealing data from India&#8217;s largest state-run telecommunications firm</a> <strong>Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd</strong> (BNSL), and that the duo even bragged about being able to intercept or divert phone calls and text messages for a large portion of the population of India.</p>\n<p>Judische appears to have outsourced the sale of databases from victim companies who refuse to pay, delegating some of that work to a cybercriminal who uses the nickname <strong>Kiberphant0m</strong> on multiple forums. In late May 2024, Kiberphant0m began advertising the sale of hundreds of gigabytes of data stolen from BSNL.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Information is worth several million dollars but I&#8217;m selling for pretty cheap,&#8221; Kiberphant0m wrote of the BSNL data in a post on the English-language cybercrime community <strong>Breach Forums</strong>. &#8220;Negotiate a deal in Telegram.&#8221;</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-69334\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/kiberphant0m-bf.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"310\" srcset=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/kiberphant0m-bf.png 1115w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/kiberphant0m-bf-768x317.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/kiberphant0m-bf-782x323.png 782w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></p>\n<p>Also in May 2024, Kiberphant0m took to the Russian-language hacking forum <strong>XSS</strong> to sell more than 250 gigabytes of data stolen from an unnamed mobile telecom provider in Asia, including a database of all active customers and software allowing the sending of text messages to all customers.</p>\n<p>On September 3, 2024, Kiberphant0m posted a sales thread on XSS titled &#8220;Selling American Telecom Access (100B+ Revenue).&#8221; Kiberphant0m&#8217;s asking price of $200,000 was apparently too high because they reposted the sales thread on Breach Forums a month later, with a headline that more clearly explained the data was stolen from <strong>Verizon</strong>&#8216;s &#8220;push-to-talk&#8221; (PTT) customers &#8212; primarily U.S. government agencies and first responders.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.404media.co/hackers-advertise-stolen-verizon-push-to-talk-call-logs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">404Media reported recently</a> that the breach does not appear to impact the main consumer Verizon network. Rather, the hackers broke into a third party provider and stole data on Verizon&#8217;s PTT systems, which are a separate product marketed towards public sector agencies, enterprises, and small businesses to communicate internally.</p>\n<h2>INTERVIEW WITH JUDISCHE</h2>\n<p>Investigators say Moucka shared a home in Kitchener with other tenants, but not his family. His mother was born in Chechnya, and he speaks Russian in addition to French and English. Moucka&#8217;s father died of a drug overdose at age 26, when the defendant was roughly five years old.</p>\n<p>A person claiming to be Judische began communicating with this author more than three months ago on Signal after KrebsOnSecurity started asking around about hacker nicknames previously used by Judische over the years.</p>\n<p>Judische admitted to stealing and ransoming data from Snowflake customers, but he said he&#8217;s not interested in selling the information, and that others have done this with some of the data sets he stole.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not really someone that sells data unless it&#8217;s crypto [databases] or credit cards because they&#8217;re the only thing I can find buyers for that actually have money for the data,&#8221; Judische told KrebsOnSecurity. &#8220;The rest is just ransom.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Judische has sent this reporter dozens of unsolicited and often profane messages from several different Signal accounts, all of which claimed to be an anonymous tipster sharing different identifying details for Judische. This appears to have been an elaborate effort by Judische to &#8220;detrace&#8221; his movements online and muddy the waters about his identity.</p>\n<p>Judische frequently claimed he had unparalleled &#8220;<strong>opsec</strong>&#8221; or <strong>operational security</strong>, a term that refers to the ability to compartmentalize and obfuscate one&#8217;s tracks online. In an effort to show he was one step ahead of investigators, Judische shared information indicating someone had given him a Mandiant researcher&#8217;s assessment of who and where they thought he was. Mandiant says those were discussion points shared with select reporters in advance of the researcher&#8217;s recent talk at the <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/press/announcing-labscon-2024-the-ultimate-cybersecurity-research-conference/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LabsCon security conference</a>.</p>\n<p>But in a conversation with KrebsOnSecurity on October 26, Judische acknowledged it was likely that the authorities were closing in on him, and said he would seriously answer certain questions about his personal life.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re coming after me for sure,&#8221; he said.<span id=\"more-67735\"></span></p>\n<p>In several previous conversations, Judische referenced suffering from an unspecified personality disorder, and when pressed said he has a condition called &#8220;schizotypal personality disorder&#8221; (STPD).</p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23061-schizotypal-personality-disorder#:~:text=Schizotypal%20personality%20disorder%20(STPD)%20is,to%20form%20and%20maintain%20relationships.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cleveland Clinic</a>, schizotypal personality disorder is marked by a consistent pattern of intense discomfort with relationships and social interactions: &#8220;People with STPD have unusual thoughts, speech and behaviors, which usually hinder their ability to form and maintain relationships.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Judische said he was prescribed medication for his psychological issues, but that he doesn&#8217;t take his meds. Which might explain why he never leaves his home.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I never go outside,&#8221; Judische allowed. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never had a friend or true relationship not online nor in person. I see people as vehicles to achieve my ends no matter how friendly I may seem on the surface, which you can see by how fast I discard people who are loyal or [that] I&#8217;ve known a long time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Judische later admitted he doesn&#8217;t have an official STPD diagnosis from a physician, but said he knows that he exhibits all the signs of someone with this condition.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t actually get diagnosed with that either,&#8221; Judische shared. &#8220;Most countries put you on lists and restrict you from certain things if you have it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Asked whether he has always lived at his current residence, Judische replied that he had to leave his hometown for his own safety.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t live safely where I&#8217;m from without getting robbed or arrested,&#8221; he said, without offering more details.</p>\n<p>A source familiar with the investigation said Moucka previously lived in Quebec, which he allegedly fled after being charged with harassing others on the social network <strong>Discord</strong>.</p>\n<p>Judische claims to have made at least $4 million in his Snowflake extortions. Judische said he and others frequently targeted business process outsourcing (BPO) companies, staffing firms that handle customer service for a wide range of organizations. They also went after managed service providers (MSPs) that oversee IT support and security for multiple companies, he claimed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Snowflake isn&#8217;t even the biggest BPO/MSP multi-company dataset on our networks, but what&#8217;s been exfiltrated from them is well over 100TB,&#8221; Judische bragged. &#8220;Only ones that don&#8217;t pay get disclosed (unless they disclose it themselves). A lot of them don&#8217;t even do their SEC filing and just pay us to fuck off.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>INTEL SECRETS</h2>\n<p>The other half of UNC5537 &#8212; 24-year-old John Erin Binns &#8212; was arrested in Turkey in late May 2024, and currently resides in a Turkish prison. However, it is unclear if Binns faces any immediate threat of extradition to the United States, where he is currently wanted on criminal hacking charges tied to the 2021 breach at T-Mobile.</p>\n<p>A person familiar with the investigation said Binns&#8217;s application for Turkish citizenship was inexplicably approved after his incarceration, leading to speculation that Binns may have bought his way out of a sticky legal situation.</p>\n<p>Under the Turkish constitution, a Turkish citizen cannot be extradited to a foreign state. Turkey has been <a href=\"https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2023/07/20/turkey-is-granting-citizenship-to-international-criminals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">criticized for its &#8220;golden passport&#8221; program</a>, which provides citizenship and sanctuary for anyone willing to pay several hundred thousand dollars.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68097\" style=\"width: 568px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68097\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-68097\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/binnspassport.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"558\" height=\"399\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-68097\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">This is an image of a passport that Binns shared in one of many unsolicited emails to KrebsOnSecurity since 2021. Binns never explained why he sent this in Feb. 2023.</p></div>\n<p>Binns&#8217;s alleged hacker alter egos &#8212; &#8220;<strong>IRDev</strong>&#8221; and &#8220;<strong>IntelSecrets</strong>&#8221; &#8212; were at once feared and revered on several cybercrime-focused Telegram communities, because he was known to possess a powerful weapon: A massive botnet. From reviewing the Telegram channels Binns frequented, we can see that others in those communities &#8212; including Judische &#8212; heavily relied on Binns and his botnet for a variety of cybercriminal purposes.</p>\n<p>The IntelSecrets nickname corresponds to an individual who has claimed responsibility for modifying the source code for the<a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=mirai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Mirai “Internet of Things” botnet</a> to create a variant known as “<strong>Satori</strong>,” and supplying it to others who used it for criminal gain and <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/09/satori-iot-botnet-operator-pleads-guilty/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">were later caught and prosecuted</a>.</p>\n<p>Since 2020, Binns has filed a flood of lawsuits naming various federal law enforcement officers and agencies — including the <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/18719615/13/1/binns-v-federal-bureau-of-investigation/#text\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FBI</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/17348542/binns-v-central-intelligence-agency/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CIA</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.socom.mil/FOIA/FOIA%20Logs/FOIA%20Log%20FY%202020.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">U.S. Special Operations Command</a> (PDF), demanding that the government turn over information collected about him and seeking restitution for his alleged kidnapping at the hands of the CIA.</p>\n<p>Binns claims he was kidnapped in Turkey and subjected to various forms of psychological and physical torture. According to Binns, the <strong>U.S. Central Intelligence Agency</strong> (CIA) falsely told their counterparts in Turkey that he was a supporter or member of the Islamic State (ISIS), a claim he says led to his detention and torture by the Turkish authorities.</p>\n<p>However, in a 2020 lawsuit he filed against the CIA, Binns himself acknowledged having visited a previously ISIS-controlled area of Syria prior to moving to Turkey in 2017.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_68107\" style=\"width: 748px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-68107\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-68107\" src=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/binnscialawsuit.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"738\" height=\"741\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-68107\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A segment of a lawsuit Binns filed in 2020 against the CIA, in which he alleges U.S. put him on a terror watch list after he traveled to Syria in 2017.</p></div>\n<p>Sources familiar with the investigation told KrebsOnSecurity that Binns was so paranoid about possible surveillance on him by American and Turkish intelligence agencies that his erratic behavior and online communications actually brought about the very government snooping that he feared.</p>\n<p>In several online chats in late 2023 on Discord, IRDev lamented being lured into a law enforcement sting operation after trying to buy a rocket launcher online. A person close to the investigation confirmed that at the beginning of 2023, IRDev began making earnest inquiries about how to purchase a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIM-92_Stinger\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stinger</a>, an American-made portable weapon that operates as an infrared surface-to-air missile.</p>\n<p>Sources told KrebsOnSecurity Binns&#8217; repeated efforts to purchase the projectile earned him multiple visits from the Turkish authorities, who were justifiably curious why he kept seeking to acquire such a powerful weapon.</p>\n<h2>WAIFU</h2>\n<p>A careful study of Judische&#8217;s postings on Telegram and Discord since 2019 shows this user is more widely known under the nickname &#8220;<strong>Waifu</strong>,&#8221; a moniker that corresponds to one of the more accomplished &#8220;SIM swappers&#8221; in the English-language cybercrime community over the years.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=sim+swapping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SIM swapping</a> involves phishing, tricking or bribing mobile phone company employees for credentials needed to redirect a target&#8217;s mobile phone number to a device the attackers control &#8212; allowing thieves to intercept incoming text messages and phone calls.</p>\n<p>Several SIM-swapping channels on Telegram maintain a frequently updated leaderboard of the 100 richest SIM-swappers, as well as the hacker handles associated with specific cybercrime groups (Waifu is ranked #24). That list has long included Waifu on a roster of hackers for a group that called itself &#8220;<strong>Beige</strong>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The term &#8220;Beige Group&#8221; came up in reporting on two stories published here in 2020. The first was in <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/08/voice-phishers-targeting-corporate-vpns/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">an August 2020 piece called Voice Phishers Targeting Corporate VPNs</a>, which warned that the COVID-19 epidemic had brought a wave of targeted voice phishing attacks that tried to trick work-at-home employees into providing access to their employers&#8217; networks. Frequent targets of the Beige group included employees at numerous top U.S. banks, ISPs, and mobile phone providers.</p>\n<p>The second time Beige Group was mentioned by sources was in reporting on <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/11/godaddy-employees-used-in-attacks-on-multiple-cryptocurrency-services/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a breach at the domain registrar GoDaddy</a>. In November 2020, intruders thought to be associated with the Beige Group tricked a GoDaddy employee into installing malicious software, and with that access they were able to redirect the web and email traffic for multiple cryptocurrency trading platforms. Other frequent targets of the Beige group included employees at numerous top U.S. banks, ISPs, and mobile phone providers.</p>\n<p>Judische&#8217;s various Telegram identities have long claimed involvement in the 2020 GoDaddy breach, and he didn&#8217;t deny his alleged role when asked directly. Judische said he prefers voice phishing or &#8220;vishing&#8221; attacks that result in the target installing data-stealing malware, as opposed to tricking the user into entering their username, password and one-time code.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Most of my ops involve malware [because] credential access burns too fast,&#8221; Judische explained.</p>\n<h2>CRACKDOWN ON HARM GROUPS?</h2>\n<p>The Telegram channels that the Judische/Waifu accounts frequented over the years show this user divided their time between posting in channels dedicated to financial cybercrime, and harassing and stalking others in harm communities like <strong>Leak Society</strong> and <strong>Court</strong>.</p>\n<p>Both of these Telegram communities are known for victimizing children through coordinated online campaigns of extortion, doxing, swatting and harassment. People affiliated with harm groups like Court and Leak Society will often recruit new members by lurking on gaming platforms, social media sites and mobile applications that are popular with young people, including <strong>Discord</strong>, <strong>Minecraft</strong>, <strong>Roblox</strong>, <strong>Steam</strong>, <strong>Telegram</strong>, and <strong>Twitch</strong>.</p>\n<p>“This type of offence usually starts with a direct message through gaming platforms and can move to more private chatrooms on other virtual platforms, typically one with video enabled features, where the conversation quickly becomes sexualized or violent,” warns a <a href=\"https://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/en/news/2024/rcmp-reminds-canadians-violent-online-groups-targeting-youth\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recent alert</a> from the <strong>Royal Canadian Mounted Police</strong> (RCMP) about the rise of sextortion groups on social media channels.</p>\n<p>“One of the tactics being used by these actors is sextortion, however, they are not using it to extract money or for sexual gratification,” the RCMP continued. “Instead they use it to further manipulate and control victims to produce more harmful and violent content as part of their ideological objectives and radicalization pathway.”</p>\n<p>Some of the largest such known groups include those that go by the names <strong>764</strong>, <strong>CVLT</strong>, <strong>Kaskar</strong>, <strong>7997</strong>, <strong>8884</strong>, <strong>2992</strong>, <strong>6996</strong>, <strong>555</strong>, <strong>Slit Town</strong>, <strong>545</strong>, <strong>404</strong>, <strong>NMK</strong>, <strong>303</strong>, and <strong>H3ll</strong>.</p>\n<p>On the various cybercrime-oriented channels Judische frequented, he often lied about his or others&#8217; involvement in various breaches. But Judische also at times shared nuggets of truth about his past, particularly when discussing the early history and membership of specific Telegram- and Discord-based cybercrime and harm groups.</p>\n<p>Judische claimed in multiple chats, including on Leak Society and Court, that they were an early member of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomwaffen_Division\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Atomwaffen Division</a> (AWD), a white supremacy group whose members are suspected of having committed multiple murders in the U.S. since 2017.</p>\n<p>In 2019, KrebsOnSecurity exposed how a loose-knit group of neo-Nazis, some of whom were affiliated with AWD, had <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/07/neo-nazi-swatters-target-dozens-of-journalists/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">doxed and/or swatted nearly three dozen journalists at a range of media publications</a>.

Corrected Moucka&#8217;s age.</p>\n<p><strong>Nov. 21, 2024:</strong> Included link to a criminal indictment against Moucka and Binns.</p>\n","content:encodedSnippet":"A 25-year-old man in Ontario, Canada has been arrested for allegedly stealing data from and extorting more than 160 companies that used the cloud data service Snowflake.\n\nImage: https://www.pomerium.com/blog/the-real-lessons-from-the-snowflake-breach\n\nOn October 30, Canadian authorities arrested Alexander Moucka, a.k.a. Connor Riley Moucka of Kitchener, Ontario, on a provisional arrest warrant from the United States. Bloomberg first reported Moucka’s alleged ties to the Snowflake hacks on Monday.\nAt the end of 2023, malicious hackers learned that many large companies had uploaded huge volumes of sensitive customer data to Snowflake accounts that were protected with little more than a username and password (no multi-factor authentication required). After scouring darknet markets for stolen Snowflake account credentials, the hackers began raiding the data storage repositories used by some of the world’s largest corporations.\nAmong those was AT&T, which disclosed in July that cybercriminals had stolen personal information and phone and text message records for roughly 110 million people — nearly all of its customers. Wired.com reported in July that AT&T paid a hacker $370,000 to delete stolen phone records.\nA report on the extortion attacks from the incident response firm Mandiant notes that Snowflake victim companies were privately approached by the hackers, who demanded a ransom in exchange for a promise not to sell or leak the stolen data. All told, more than 160 Snowflake customers were relieved of data, including TicketMaster, Lending Tree, Advance Auto Parts and Neiman Marcus.\nMoucka is alleged to have used the hacker handles Judische and Waifu, among many others. These monikers correspond to a prolific cybercriminal whose exploits were the subject of a recent story published here about the overlap between Western, English-speaking cybercriminals and extremist groups that harass and extort minors into harming themselves or others.\nOn May 2, 2024, Judische claimed on the fraud-focused Telegram channel Star Chat that they had hacked Santander Bank, one of the first known Snowflake victims. Judische would repeat that claim in Star Chat on May 13 — the day before Santander publicly disclosed a data breach — and would periodically blurt out the names of other Snowflake victims before their data even went up for sale on the cybercrime forums.\n404 Media reports that at a court hearing in Ontario this morning, Moucka called in from a prison phone and said he was seeking legal aid to hire an attorney.\nTELECOM DOMINOES\nMandiant has attributed the Snowflake compromises to a group it calls “UNC5537,” with members based in North America and Turkey. Sources close to the investigation tell KrebsOnSecurity the UNC5537 member in Turkey is John Erin Binns, an elusive American man indicted by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) for a 2021 breach at T-Mobile that exposed the personal information of at least 76.6 million customers.\nUpdate: The Justice Department has unsealed an indictment (PDF) against Moucka and Binns, charging them with one count of conspiracy; 10 counts of wire fraud; four counts of computer fraud and abuse; two counts of extortion in relation to computer fraud; and two counts aggravated identity theft.\nIn a statement on Moucka’s arrest, Mandiant said UNC5537 aka Alexander ‘Connor’ Moucka has proven to be one of the most consequential threat actors of 2024.\n“In April 2024, UNC5537 launched a campaign, systematically compromising misconfigured SaaS instances across over a hundred organizations,” wrote Austin Larsen, Mandiant’s senior threat analyst. “The operation, which left organizations reeling from significant data loss and extortion attempts, highlighted the alarming scale of harm an individual can cause using off-the-shelf tools.”\nSources involved in the investigation said UNC5537 has focused on hacking into telecommunications companies around the world. Those sources told KrebsOnSecurity that Binns and Judische are suspected of stealing data from India’s largest state-run telecommunications firm Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BNSL), and that the duo even bragged about being able to intercept or divert phone calls and text messages for a large portion of the population of India.\nJudische appears to have outsourced the sale of databases from victim companies who refuse to pay, delegating some of that work to a cybercriminal who uses the nickname Kiberphant0m on multiple forums. In late May 2024, Kiberphant0m began advertising the sale of hundreds of gigabytes of data stolen from BSNL.\n“Information is worth several million dollars but I’m selling for pretty cheap,” Kiberphant0m wrote of the BSNL data in a post on the English-language cybercrime community Breach Forums. “Negotiate a deal in Telegram.”\n\nAlso in May 2024, Kiberphant0m took to the Russian-language hacking forum XSS to sell more than 250 gigabytes of data stolen from an unnamed mobile telecom provider in Asia, including a database of all active customers and software allowing the sending of text messages to all customers.\nOn September 3, 2024, Kiberphant0m posted a sales thread on XSS titled “Selling American Telecom Access (100B+ Revenue).” Kiberphant0m’s asking price of $200,000 was apparently too high because they reposted the sales thread on Breach Forums a month later, with a headline that more clearly explained the data was stolen from Verizon‘s “push-to-talk” (PTT) customers — primarily U.S. government agencies and first responders.\n404Media reported recently that the breach does not appear to impact the main consumer Verizon network. Rather, the hackers broke into a third party provider and stole data on Verizon’s PTT systems, which are a separate product marketed towards public sector agencies, enterprises, and small businesses to communicate internally.\nINTERVIEW WITH JUDISCHE\nInvestigators say Moucka shared a home in Kitchener with other tenants, but not his family. His mother was born in Chechnya, and he speaks Russian in addition to French and English. Moucka’s father died of a drug overdose at age 26, when the defendant was roughly five years old.\nA person claiming to be Judische began communicating with this author more than three months ago on Signal after KrebsOnSecurity started asking around about hacker nicknames previously used by Judische over the years.\nJudische admitted to stealing and ransoming data from Snowflake customers, but he said he’s not interested in selling the information, and that others have done this with some of the data sets he stole.\n“I’m not really someone that sells data unless it’s crypto [databases] or credit cards because they’re the only thing I can find buyers for that actually have money for the data,” Judische told KrebsOnSecurity. “The rest is just ransom.”\nJudische has sent this reporter dozens of unsolicited and often profane messages from several different Signal accounts, all of which claimed to be an anonymous tipster sharing different identifying details for Judische. This appears to have been an elaborate effort by Judische to “detrace” his movements online and muddy the waters about his identity.\nJudische frequently claimed he had unparalleled “opsec” or operational security, a term that refers to the ability to compartmentalize and obfuscate one’s tracks online. In an effort to show he was one step ahead of investigators, Judische shared information indicating someone had given him a Mandiant researcher’s assessment of who and where they thought he was. Mandiant says those were discussion points shared with select reporters in advance of the researcher’s recent talk at the LabsCon security conference.\nBut in a conversation with KrebsOnSecurity on October 26, Judische acknowledged it was likely that the authorities were closing in on him, and said he would seriously answer certain questions about his personal life.\n“They’re coming after me for sure,” he said.\nIn several previous conversations, Judische referenced suffering from an unspecified personality disorder, and when pressed said he has a condition called “schizotypal personality disorder” (STPD).\nAccording to the Cleveland Clinic, schizotypal personality disorder is marked by a consistent pattern of intense discomfort with relationships and social interactions: “People with STPD have unusual thoughts, speech and behaviors, which usually hinder their ability to form and maintain relationships.”\nJudische said he was prescribed medication for his psychological issues, but that he doesn’t take his meds. Which might explain why he never leaves his home.\n“I never go outside,” Judische allowed. “I’ve never had a friend or true relationship not online nor in person. I see people as vehicles to achieve my ends no matter how friendly I may seem on the surface, which you can see by how fast I discard people who are loyal or [that] I’ve known a long time.”\nJudische later admitted he doesn’t have an official STPD diagnosis from a physician, but said he knows that he exhibits all the signs of someone with this condition.\n“I can’t actually get diagnosed with that either,” Judische shared. “Most countries put you on lists and restrict you from certain things if you have it.”\nAsked whether he has always lived at his current residence, Judische replied that he had to leave his hometown for his own safety.\n“I can’t live safely where I’m from without getting robbed or arrested,” he said, without offering more details.\nA source familiar with the investigation said Moucka previously lived in Quebec, which he allegedly fled after being charged with harassing others on the social network Discord.\nJudische claims to have made at least $4 million in his Snowflake extortions. Judische said he and others frequently targeted business process outsourcing (BPO) companies, staffing firms that handle customer service for a wide range of organizations. They also went after managed service providers (MSPs) that oversee IT support and security for multiple companies, he claimed.\n“Snowflake isn’t even the biggest BPO/MSP multi-company dataset on our networks, but what’s been exfiltrated from them is well over 100TB,” Judische bragged. “Only ones that don’t pay get disclosed (unless they disclose it themselves). A lot of them don’t even do their SEC filing and just pay us to fuck off.”\nINTEL SECRETS\nThe other half of UNC5537 — 24-year-old John Erin Binns — was arrested in Turkey in late May 2024, and currently resides in a Turkish prison. However, it is unclear if Binns faces any immediate threat of extradition to the United States, where he is currently wanted on criminal hacking charges tied to the 2021 breach at T-Mobile.\nA person familiar with the investigation said Binns’s application for Turkish citizenship was inexplicably approved after his incarceration, leading to speculation that Binns may have bought his way out of a sticky legal situation.\nUnder the Turkish constitution, a Turkish citizen cannot be extradited to a foreign state. Turkey has been criticized for its “golden passport” program, which provides citizenship and sanctuary for anyone willing to pay several hundred thousand dollars.\n\nThis is an image of a passport that Binns shared in one of many unsolicited emails to KrebsOnSecurity since 2021. Binns never explained why he sent this in Feb. 2023.\n\nBinns’s alleged hacker alter egos — “IRDev” and “IntelSecrets” — were at once feared and revered on several cybercrime-focused Telegram communities, because he was known to possess a powerful weapon: A massive botnet. From reviewing the Telegram channels Binns frequented, we can see that others in those communities — including Judische — heavily relied on Binns and his botnet for a variety of cybercriminal purposes.\nThe IntelSecrets nickname corresponds to an individual who has claimed responsibility for modifying the source code for the Mirai “Internet of Things” botnet to create a variant known as “Satori,” and supplying it to others who used it for criminal gain and were later caught and prosecuted.\nSince 2020, Binns has filed a flood of lawsuits naming various federal law enforcement officers and agencies — including the FBI, the CIA, and the U.S. Special Operations Command (PDF), demanding that the government turn over information collected about him and seeking restitution for his alleged kidnapping at the hands of the CIA.\nBinns claims he was kidnapped in Turkey and subjected to various forms of psychological and physical torture. According to Binns, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) falsely told their counterparts in Turkey that he was a supporter or member of the Islamic State (ISIS), a claim he says led to his detention and torture by the Turkish authorities.\nHowever, in a 2020 lawsuit he filed against the CIA, Binns himself acknowledged having visited a previously ISIS-controlled area of Syria prior to moving to Turkey in 2017.\n\nA segment of a lawsuit Binns filed in 2020 against the CIA, in which he alleges U.S. put him on a terror watch list after he traveled to Syria in 2017.\n\nSources familiar with the investigation told KrebsOnSecurity that Binns was so paranoid about possible surveillance on him by American and Turkish intelligence agencies that his erratic behavior and online communications actually brought about the very government snooping that he feared.\nIn several online chats in late 2023 on Discord, IRDev lamented being lured into a law enforcement sting operation after trying to buy a rocket launcher online. A person close to the investigation confirmed that at the beginning of 2023, IRDev began making earnest inquiries about how to purchase a Stinger, an American-made portable weapon that operates as an infrared surface-to-air missile.\nSources told KrebsOnSecurity Binns’ repeated efforts to purchase the projectile earned him multiple visits from the Turkish authorities, who were justifiably curious why he kept seeking to acquire such a powerful weapon.\nWAIFU\nA careful study of Judische’s postings on Telegram and Discord since 2019 shows this user is more widely known under the nickname “Waifu,” a moniker that corresponds to one of the more accomplished “SIM swappers” in the English-language cybercrime community over the years.\nSIM swapping involves phishing, tricking or bribing mobile phone company employees for credentials needed to redirect a target’s mobile phone number to a device the attackers control — allowing thieves to intercept incoming text messages and phone calls.\nSeveral SIM-swapping channels on Telegram maintain a frequently updated leaderboard of the 100 richest SIM-swappers, as well as the hacker handles associated with specific cybercrime groups (Waifu is ranked #24). That list has long included Waifu on a roster of hackers for a group that called itself “Beige.”\nThe term “Beige Group” came up in reporting on two stories published here in 2020. The first was in an August 2020 piece called Voice Phishers Targeting Corporate VPNs, which warned that the COVID-19 epidemic had brought a wave of targeted voice phishing attacks that tried to trick work-at-home employees into providing access to their employers’ networks. Frequent targets of the Beige group included employees at numerous top U.S. banks, ISPs, and mobile phone providers.\nThe second time Beige Group was mentioned by sources was in reporting on a breach at the domain registrar GoDaddy. In November 2020, intruders thought to be associated with the Beige Group tricked a GoDaddy employee into installing malicious software, and with that access they were able to redirect the web and email traffic for multiple cryptocurrency trading platforms. Other frequent targets of the Beige group included employees at numerous top U.S. banks, ISPs, and mobile phone providers.\nJudische’s various Telegram identities have long claimed involvement in the 2020 GoDaddy breach, and he didn’t deny his alleged role when asked directly. Judische said he prefers voice phishing or “vishing” attacks that result in the target installing data-stealing malware, as opposed to tricking the user into entering their username, password and one-time code.\n“Most of my ops involve malware [because] credential access burns too fast,” Judische explained.\nCRACKDOWN ON HARM GROUPS?\nThe Telegram channels that the Judische/Waifu accounts frequented over the years show this user divided their time between posting in channels dedicated to financial cybercrime, and harassing and stalking others in harm communities like Leak Society and Court.\nBoth of these Telegram communities are known for victimizing children through coordinated online campaigns of extortion, doxing, swatting and harassment. People affiliated with harm groups like Court and Leak Society will often recruit new members by lurking on gaming platforms, social media sites and mobile applications that are popular with young people, including Discord, Minecraft, Roblox, Steam, Telegram, and Twitch.\n“This type of offence usually starts with a direct message through gaming platforms and can move to more private chatrooms on other virtual platforms, typically one with video enabled features, where the conversation quickly becomes sexualized or violent,” warns a recent alert from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) about the rise of sextortion groups on social media channels.\n“One of the tactics being used by these actors is sextortion, however, they are not using it to extract money or for sexual gratification,” the RCMP continued. “Instead they use it to further manipulate and control victims to produce more harmful and violent content as part of their ideological objectives and radicalization pathway.”\nSome of the largest such known groups include those that go by the names 764, CVLT, Kaskar, 7997, 8884, 2992, 6996, 555, Slit Town, 545, 404, NMK, 303, and H3ll.\nOn the various cybercrime-oriented channels Judische frequented, he often lied about his or others’ involvement in various breaches. But Judische also at times shared nuggets of truth about his past, particularly when discussing the early history and membership of specific Telegram- and Discord-based cybercrime and harm groups.\nJudische claimed in multiple chats, including on Leak Society and Court, that they were an early member of the Atomwaffen Division (AWD), a white supremacy group whose members are suspected of having committed multiple murders in the U.S. since 2017.\nIn 2019, KrebsOnSecurity exposed how a loose-knit group of neo-Nazis, some of whom were affiliated with AWD, had doxed and/or swatted nearly three dozen journalists at a range of media publications. Swatting involves communicating a false police report of a bomb threat or hostage situation and tricking authorities into sending a heavily armed police response to a targeted address.\nJudsiche also told a fellow denizen of Court that years ago he was active in an older harm community called “RapeLash,” a truly vile Discord server known for attracting Atomwaffen members. A 2018 retrospective on RapeLash posted to the now defunct neo-Nazi forum Fascist Forge explains that RapeLash was awash in gory, violent images and child pornography.\nA Fascist Forge member named “Huddy” recalled that RapeLash was the third incarnation of an extremist community also known as “FashWave,” short for Fascist Wave.\n“I have no real knowledge of what happened with the intermediary phase known as ‘FashWave 2.0,’ but FashWave 3.0 houses multiple known Satanists and other degenerates connected with AWD, one of which got arrested on possession of child pornography charges, last I heard,” Huddy shared.\nIn June 2024, a Mandiant employee told Bloomberg that UNC5537 members have made death threats against cybersecurity experts investigating the hackers, and that in one case the group used artificial intelligence to create fake nude photos of a researcher to harass them.\nAllison Nixon is chief research officer with the New York-based cybersecurity firm Unit 221B. Nixon is among several researchers who have faced harassment and specific threats of physical violence from Judische.\nNixon said Judische is likely to argue in court that his self-described psychological disorder(s) should somehow excuse his long career in cybercrime and in harming others.\n“They ran a misinformation campaign in a sloppy attempt to cover up the hacking campaign,” Nixon said of Judische. “Coverups are an acknowledgment of guilt, which will undermine a mental illness defense in court. We expect that violent hackers from the [cybercrime community] will experience increasingly harsh sentences as the crackdown continues.”\n5:34 p.m. ET: Updated story to include a clarification from Mandiant.

This story examines a recent spear-phishing campaign that ensued when a California hotel had its booking.com credentials stolen. We’ll also explore an array of cybercrime services aimed at phishers who target hotels that rely on the world’s most visited travel website.\nAccording to the market share website statista.com, booking.com is by far the Internet’s busiest travel service, with nearly 550 million visits in September. KrebsOnSecurity last week heard from a reader whose close friend received a targeted phishing message within the Booking mobile app just minutes after making a reservation at a California hotel.\nThe missive bore the name of the hotel and referenced details from their reservation, claiming that booking.com’s anti-fraud system required additional information about the customer before the reservation could be finalized.\n\nThe phishing message our reader’s friend received after making a reservation at booking.com in late October.\n\nIn an email to KrebsOnSecurity, booking.com confirmed one of its partners had suffered a security incident that allowed unauthorized access to customer booking information.\n“Our security teams are currently investigating the incident you mentioned and can confirm that it was indeed a phishing attack targeting one of our accommodation partners, which unfortunately is not a new situation and quite common across industries,” booking.com replied. “Importantly, we want to clarify that there has been no compromise of Booking.com’s internal systems.”\n\nThe phony booking.com website generated by visiting the link in the text message.\n\nBooking.com said it now requires 2FA, which forces partners to provide a one-time passcode from a mobile authentication app (Pulse) in addition to a username and password.\n“2FA is required and enforced, including for partners to access payment details from customers securely,” a booking.com spokesperson wrote. “That’s why the cybercriminals follow-up with messages to try and get customers to make payments outside of our platform.”\n“That said, the phishing attacks stem from partners’ machines being compromised with malware, which has enabled them to also gain access to the partners’ accounts and to send the messages that your reader has flagged,” they continued.\nIt’s unclear, however, if the company’s 2FA requirement is enforced for all or just newer partners. Booking.com did not respond to questions about that, and its current account security advice urges customers to enable 2FA.\n\nA scan of social media networks showed this is not an uncommon scam.\n\nIn November 2023, the security firm SecureWorks detailed how scammers targeted booking.com hospitality partners with data-stealing malware. SecureWorks said these attacks had been going on since at least March 2023.\n“The hotel did not enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) on its Booking.com access, so logging into the account with the stolen credentials was easy,” SecureWorks said of the booking.com partner it investigated.\nIn June 2024, booking.com told the BBC that phishing attacks targeting travelers had increased 900 percent, and that thieves taking advantage of new artificial intelligence (AI) tools were the primary driver of this trend.\nBooking.com told the BCC the company had started using AI to fight AI-based phishing attacks. Booking.com’s statement said their investments in that arena “blocked 85 million fraudulent reservations over more than 1.5 million phishing attempts in 2023.”\n\nThe domain name in the phony booking.com website sent to our reader’s friend — guestssecureverification[.]com — was registered to the email address ilotirabec207@gmail.com. According to DomainTools.com, this email address was used to register more than 700 other phishing domains in the past month alone.\nMany of the 700+ domains appear to target hospitality companies, including platforms like booking.com and Airbnb. Others seem crafted to phish users of Shopify, Steam, and a variety of financial platforms. A full, defanged list of domains is available here.\nA cursory review of recent posts across dozens of cybercrime forums monitored by the security firm Intel 471 shows there is a great demand for compromised booking.com accounts belonging to hotels and other partners.\nOne post last month on the Russian-language hacking forum BHF offered up to $5,000 for each hotel account. This seller claims to help people monetize hacked booking.com partners, apparently by using the stolen credentials to set up fraudulent listings.\nA service advertised on the English-language crime community BreachForums in October courts phishers who may need help with certain aspects of their phishing campaigns targeting booking.com partners. Those include more than two million hotel email addresses, and services designed to help phishers organize large volumes of phished records. Customers can interact with the service via an automated Telegram bot.\n\nSome cybercriminals appear to have used compromised booking.com accounts to power their own travel agencies catering to fellow scammers, with up to 50 percent discounts on hotel reservations through booking.com. Others are selling ready-to-use “config” files designed to make it simple to conduct automated login attempts against booking.com administrator accounts.\nSecureWorks found the phishers targeting booking.com partner hotels used malware to steal credentials.
