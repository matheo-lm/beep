            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt group logo"></p><h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2><p>In 2024, Insikt Group significantly expanded its tracking of malicious infrastructure by covering more malware families and categories, additional infrastructure types such as staging servers, and integrating data sources like Recorded Future Network Intelligence, enhancing threat detection, higher-tier infrastructure insights, and victimology analysis. While many key 2023 trends persisted  such as Cobalt Strike dominating offensive security tools (OSTs), AsyncRAT and QuasarRAT leading among remote access trojans (RATs), China and the United States (US) being the top hosting locations, and law enforcement actions having often only temporary impact  Insikt Group identified several emerging trends in 2024.</p><p>Notably, malware-as-a-service (MaaS) infostealers, led by LummaC2, grew in prevalence, likely driven by law enforcement actions against competitor infostealers and rapid innovation by LummaC2. Additionally, Android remained the primary target for mobile malware, with Hook leading. While Latrodectus dominated droppers and loaders despite law enforcement disruptions in the loader ecosystem, traffic distribution systems (TDSs) continued to enhance cybercrime efficiency, as seen with TAG-124, and the abuse of content delivery networks (CDNs) like Cloudflare surged. In regards to state-sponsored groups, China notably increased its use of relay networks such as ArcSilt, while Russia continued its abuse of a wide range of <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/threat-actors-leverage-internet-services-to-enhance-data-theft-and-weaken-security-defenses" target="_blank">legitimate internet services (LIS)</a>.</p><p>Defenders should leverage this report&#39;s insights to strengthen security controls by prioritizing top malware and infrastructure techniques, and thereby enhance network monitoring and deploy relevant detections like YARA, Sigma, and Snort. This should be complemented by investments in tracking evolving malicious infrastructure dynamics, conducting threat simulations to test defenses, and effectively monitoring the broader threat landscape. Regarding LIS, defenders must balance blocking, flagging, or allowing high-risk services based on their assessed criticality and risk level.</p><p>As malicious infrastructure evolves and detection improves, Insikt Group expects existing trends to persist in 2025, driven by continuous threat actor innovation rather than drastic shifts. For example, the &quot;as-a-service&quot; ecosystem will likely expand, and threat actors will increasingly rely on legitimate tools, services, and CDNs to evade detection. Furthermore, with growing mobile reliance, Insikt Group expects mobile-based threats to continue to rise. Relay networks, primarily used by Chinese state-sponsored groups up until now, may see broader adoption by cybercriminals and other state-sponsored groups. Lastly, law enforcement actions are expected to have a greater impact due to enhanced international cooperation and accrued expertise in large-scale cybercrime takedowns.</p><h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2><ul><li>MaaS infostealers led in infections in 2024, with LummaC2 dominating command-and-control (C2) servers as continuous innovation and law enforcement actions against rivals like RedLine Stealer reshaped the cybercrime ecosystem.</li><li>AsyncRAT and Quasar RAT remained the top remote access tools (RATs), while MaaS-based malware like DcRAT continued widespread use.</li><li>The US (North America), Brazil (South America), Angola (Africa), France (Europe), India (Asia), and Australia (Oceania) recorded the highest number of victims in their respective regions based on Recorded Future Network Intelligence, with AsyncRAT emerging as the most prevalent malware in most cases. Other significant threats included QuasarRAT and Cobalt Strike.</li><li>Android remained the primary target for mobile malware, with nine of the top ten families focusing on it, alongside the rise of mercenary spyware and potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) like stalkerware.</li><li>Cobalt Strike accounted for two-thirds of offensive security tool command-and-control (C2) servers, with jQuery as the most popular malleable profile and cs2modrewrite targeting the most victim countries. Cobalt Strike is followed by Metasploit, with detections of Sliver and Brute Ratel C4 rising significantly.</li><li>Mozi Botnet was the largest tracked botnet in 2024 based on the number of identified bots, while older botnets remained active, being primarily used for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, as well as credential theft and localized attacks, as seen with Fenix Botnet.</li><li>Latrodectus dominated all droppers and loaders in 2024, accounting for 33% of detections, likely driven by law enforcement disruptions in the loader ecosystem, while most top families emerged post-2021, indicating shorter lifespans.</li><li>TDS continued to play a crucial role in cybercrime by improving efficiency, targeting, and profitability while evading detection, exemplified by TAG-124, which served a broad user base, including ransomware groups like Rhysida.</li><li>The US and China dominated malicious hosting, while bulletproof hosting providers like Stark Industries played a growing role in cybercrime infrastructure.</li><li>Chinese state-sponsored groups expanded their use of anonymization networks in 2024 to target entities worldwide, enabling them to blend with legitimate traffic and complicate victim identification, while RedDelta used Cloudflare to proxy C2 traffic and geo-fence malicious files.</li><li>Russian state-sponsored groups increasingly relied on legitimate services like Ngrok, Cloudflare, and Telegram to evade detection, with BlueDelta shifting to Ngrok after takedown efforts and BlueAlpha using Cloudflare Tunnels to stage GammaDrop malware.</li></ul><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>Insikt Group proactively identifies and monitors infrastructure associated with hundreds of malware families, threat actors, and other artifacts, including phishing kits, scanners, and relay networks. By automatically validating malicious infrastructure through various proprietary methods on a daily basis, Insikt Group provides accurate risk representation, enabling Recorded Future customers to enhance their detection and defense capabilities.</p><p>Building on Insikt Group&#39;s annual adversary infrastructure reports from <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/2022-adversary-infrastructure-report" target="_blank">2022</a> and <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2024-1209.pdf" target="_blank">2023</a>, the 2024 Malicious Infrastructure Report provides a concise, data-based overview of malicious infrastructure observed throughout 2024. This year, it specifically emphasizes the synergy among passive infrastructure detection, higher-tier infrastructure insights powered by Recorded Future Network Intelligence, and victim identification. Overall, this report is for anyone interested in malicious infrastructure, offering a high-level overview of its current state as well as summaries of key findings to inform decision-making and provide a broad perspective in this highly dynamic environment.</p><p>Recognizing the challenge of categorizing malware types in a mutually exclusive manner due to their overlapping functionalities, this report establishes a set of malware categories to facilitate analysis, as detailed in <strong>Appendix A</strong>, with brief definitions for each. Notably, certain malware categories, such as crypters, have been intentionally excluded due to the usual absence of network artifacts.</p><p>Beyond examining malicious infrastructure through the lens of malware categories, Insikt Group also monitors it by type, with each type assigned a distinct risk scoring within the Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud. This differentiation reflects varying levels of severity  for instance, network traffic to or from a C2 server in a corporate network may indicate higher risk compared to a management panel, as it typically implies active malicious activity. The infrastructure types defined by Insikt Group are detailed in <strong>Appendix B</strong>.</p><h2 id="2024-malicious-infrastructure-insights-by-the-numbers">2024 Malicious Infrastructure Insights by the Numbers</h2><p>Proactively identifying malicious infrastructure is a complex task shaped by various factors. In addition to the vast volume of data, each malware family, version, or infrastructure linked to specific threat actors often employs entirely unique setups. Detection becomes even more challenging due to factors such as hosting behind CDNs like Cloudflare, the use of high or random ports, reliance on <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/threat-actors-leverage-internet-services-to-enhance-data-theft-and-weaken-security-defenses" target="_blank">legitimate internet services</a> such as Discord or Telegram, or the exploitation of compromised infrastructure.</p><p>These setups also evolve continuously, demanding that Insikt Group constantly innovate and refine its tracking methodologies. Considering all these factors, this report examines malicious infrastructure across multiple categories, including infostealers, backdoors and RATs, mobile malware, OSTs, botnets, droppers and loaders, phishing kits, web shells, and ransomware.</p><p>Overall, in 2024, there has been a significant rise in identified malicious infrastructure, driven by an evolving threat landscape and advancements in detection methodologies by Insikt Group. For instance, the number of unique, validated C2 servers doubled from 2023 to 2024, while unique, validated management panels saw a 69% increase over the same period.</p><p>In addition, using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified victims in approximately 200 countries worldwide in 2024 based on victim IP address geolocation. Countries in <strong>Figure 1</strong> were categorized into five groups based on the number of unique victims detected, with those showing high exposure being geographically dispersed worldwide. Notably, accurately measuring malware impact across countries is challenging due to variations in population size, digital footprint, analytical biases (for example, the types of malware tracked), internet infrastructure (such as proxies), and the geographical hosting choices of victim organizations.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/Fig_1_86418b387b.png" alt="Malware impact by country"><em><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Malware impact by country based on Recorded Future Network Intelligence (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><p><strong>Figure 2</strong> shows the distribution of victims by country across different continents. In North America, the US is the most targeted country, accounting for around 87% of unique victims in the region despite making up only about half of its population. The high victim count in the US is likely driven by factors such as its large population, extensive digital footprint, widespread English use (exploited in phishing campaigns), and economics, while also being influenced by the country&#39;s role as a global infrastructure hub, providing hosting and digital services to organizations worldwide. Most victims are linked to AsyncRAT, followed by SolarMarker RAT and QuasarRAT (see <strong>Table 1</strong>). Notably, unlike AsyncRAT and QuasarRAT, SolarMarker RAT is <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/exploring-the-depths-of-solarmarkers-multi-tiered-infrastructure" target="_blank">believed</a> to be operated by a single threat actor and has previously been observed predominantly targeting the US.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/Fig_2_529f459d62.png" alt="victim by country"><em><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Shares of unique victim by country and continent (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><p>In South America, Brazil recorded the highest number of unique victims, accounting for 86% of the regions total, while also only making up around half of the continents population. Previously <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/angelicamarideoliveira/2023/09/27/brazil-is-the-worlds-second-most-vulnerable-country-to-cyberattacks/" target="_blank">identified</a> as one of the countries most vulnerable to cyberattacks, Brazil has long been a hotspot for both global and local cyber threats, <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2024-04-10-world-first-cybercrime-index-ranks-countries-cybercrime-threat-level" target="_blank">ranking</a> high in cybercrime activity, with groups like Grandoreiro operating almost exclusively within its borders. In 2024, QuasarRAT infections were the most prevalent among Brazilian victims, followed by infections linked to AsyncRAT and SectopRAT.</p><p>In Africa, Angola recorded the highest number of unique victims, followed by Ghana, South Africa, the Republic of the Congo, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Notably, in two of the five most targeted African countries, PlugX, a malware linked to multiple Chinese state-sponsored groups, ranked among the most prevalent malware.</p><p>In Europe, France had the highest number of unique victims, followed by Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Poland. AsyncRAT was the most prevalent malware across all five countries, with Cobalt Strike ranking second in three of them. The distribution of victims in these top five countries closely aligns with their population sizes. Notably, in the Netherlands, GobRAT  a backdoor targeting Linux routers with malware written in Go  ranked among the top three malware families.</p><p>In Asia, India recorded the highest number of unique victims, followed by China, Indonesia, Thailand, and Hong Kong. Approximately 73% of all victims in these countries were linked to AsyncRAT, QuasarRAT, and Cobalt Strike infections. Notably, Brute Ratel C4 ranked among the top three malware in Hong Kong, highlighting its growing significance.</p><p>In Oceania, Australia accounted for 87% of all unique victims despite making up only 60% of the region&#39;s population. AsyncRAT was the most prevalent malware, linked to over half of Australia&#39;s victims, while in New Zealand, 67% of victims were associated with AsyncRAT infections.</p><p><strong>Table 1</strong> presents the full list of the top three malware families for each of the five leading countries in each continent, based on the number of unique victims observed by Insikt Group in those countries.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Modern attack surfaces extend across every place your business operates, from your first-party technology assets to your third-party network of suppliers and vendors. To spot risks before attackers do, you need to maintain continuous visibility across this expanding landscape. Employee credentials can become compromised, unknown or vulnerable internet assets can be exploited, and supply chain partners with spotty security hygiene can provide adversaries with easy access to your network and data. </p><p>At Recorded Future, weve seen firsthand how practitioners are transforming their security programs by adopting proactive strategies to protect their first- and third-party attack surfaces. </p><p>In our experience, security teams that successfully defend against these threats share a common approach: They combine comprehensive visibility with contextual intelligence.  </p><p>By understanding not just the risks that exist, but why those risks matter to the organization, these security teams enable rapid, informed decision-making that strengthens their security posture.</p><p>In this blog post, well explore how a few select customers are taking an intelligence-led approach to reducing attack surface risks. Youll discover how:</p><ul><li>Toyota Motor North America <strong>quickly remediates compromised employee credentials</strong> to prevent unauthorized access.</li><li>Cummins <strong>identifies and secures internet-facing assets</strong> to reduce their vulnerable attack surface.</li><li>Novavax <strong>takes an intelligence-driven approach to vendor risk management</strong> for greater supply chain resilience.</li><li>INVESTBANK <strong>maintains continuous awareness of vulnerabilities</strong> alongside new updates and releases.</li></ul><p>See the impactful results these companies have achieved, and learn how we can empower your security team to stay ahead of threats and build lasting resilience.</p><h2 id="toyota-motors-north-america-defends-the-human-identity-attack-surface">Toyota Motors North America Defends the Human Identity Attack Surface</h2><p><em>&quot;The timeliness of being able to take compromised credentials out of the marketplace is really beneficial.&quot;</em>  Curtis Hartsell, CTI Manager, Toyota Motors North America (<a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/videos/toyota" target="_blank">watch the full video here</a>)</p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/Tdd9/reports/2024-dbir-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf" target="_blank">2024 Verizon Data Breach Investigation Report</a>, 31% of all breaches over the last 10 years have involved the use of stolen credentials. With the rise of stealthy infostealers, threat actors are more likely to log in with stolen credentials than hack their way in. The Verizon report also found more than a thousand credentials being posted for sale on the dark web each day, with an average price of $10, proving that theres serious demand from cybercriminals. </p><p>To help Toyota Motors North America gain an edge, Cyber Threat Intelligence Manager Curtis Hartsell relies on Recorded Futures <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/identity-intelligence" target="_blank">Identity Intelligence Module</a>. The product allows Hartsell and team to take swift action on compromised credentials, automating credential resets before bad actors can gain access to the companys systems. </p><p>In one example, he said, We had a compromised credential at 7 oclock. Two hours later Identity [Intelligence] is notifying of those compromised credentials, and about thirty or forty minutes after the Identity Module alert, we see attempts to use that account. </p><p>Immediate visibility into newly compromised credentials helps Toyota Motors North America automate response actions and secure accounts instantly. This automation eliminates the need for constant manual intervention, allowing Hartsell and team to focus on higher-value tasks. </p><h2 id="cummins-identifies-and-reduces-attack-surface-risk">Cummins Identifies and Reduces Attack Surface Risk</h2><p><em>We have two main problem statements when were looking at this attack surface problem: What is our attack surface? And then how do we secure it? Theres a couple of different actions you take, whether its remediation or reduction. We love reduction. If it cant be on the internet. Great. Lets get it off there.</em>  Mattheus Bittick, Attack Surface Reduction Analyst, Cummins (watch the full video <a href="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/channel/06bopitbe1?wchannelid=06bopitbe1&wmediaid=1j7x7zezcc" target="_blank">here</a>)</p><p>Continuous monitoring of your first-party attack surface  everything in your network and systems that can be accessed from the internet   is resource-intensive and challenging, especially given that employees and contractors often spin up assets outside your security teams purview. This should be a major concern, as 76% of organizations have suffered a cyberattack that started with the exploit of an unknown, unmanaged, or poorly managed internet-facing asset (<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/opinion/Why-companies-need-attack-surface-management-in-2024" target="_blank">TechTarget</a>).</p><p>Before implementing Recorded Futures <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/attack-surface-intelligence" target="_blank">Attack Surface Intelligence Module</a>, Cummins Attack Surface Reduction Analyst Mattheus Bittick said his team spent around 80 hours per week trying to analyze and map the companys external attack surface. And even then, the team was blind to around 20% of the landscape. </p><p>With no capacity for continuous scanning and information-gathering and no existing inventory specific to external-facing assets, Bitticks team was unable to prioritize risks based on the attackers perspective. And since the company has had an internet presence for a long period of time, there was a large unexplored landscape of unknown unknowns and abandoned infrastructure. </p><p>Now, Attack Surface Intelligence is a central technology for the Cummins Attack Surface Risk Management Program.</p><p><em>The first tool I go to every morning is Attack Surface Intelligence. Whats new today? Whats going on that we need to prioritize and triage? Recorded Future shows us how we can take action, and takes our risk assessments to the next level.</em>  Mattheus Bittick, Attack Surface Reduction Analyst, Cummins</p><p>Thanks to automated discovery and attribution of assets associated with the organization, Bittick and team get a real-time view of their external attack surface, from the same perspective as an attacker. This increased visibility into key areas of risk like vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and shadow IT has helped Cummins reduce its vulnerable attack surface by 51% over a period of six months. And by removing key areas of risk and decommissioning forgotten infrastructure, the company has reduced its cyber insurance premiums by 32% year-over-year. </p><h2 id="novavax-proactively-monitors-for-third-party-vendor-breaches">Novavax Proactively Monitors for Third-Party Vendor Breaches</h2><p><em>We sharpened a lot of processes by introducing Third-Party Intelligence to our risk assessments, so we can make informed decisions about the vendors we do business with[Recorded Future] gives us an opportunity to launch an investigation to see what the vendor has access to, what we need to be concerned about, and how we can better protect ourselves.</em>  Nathalie Salisbury, Strategic Threat Intelligence Analyst, Novavax (Watch the full video <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/videos/novavax" target="_blank">here</a>)</p><p>Since third-party vendors arent always held to the same standards as enterprise organizations, those with spotty security hygiene can become the soft underbelly of your attack surface. <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/Tdd9/reports/2024-dbir-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf" target="_blank">According to the 2024 Verizon Data Breach Investigation Report</a>, 15% of breaches involved a third party or supplier. And the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/documents/us-en/107a02e94948f4ec" target="_blank">IBM Cost of a Data Breach 2024 Report</a> found that the average cost of a breach increased by $240,599 when it came via a third party.</p><p>Making matters worse, supply chain partners often delay or withhold disclosure of security incidents due to concerns about reputation and liability. As they take time to investigate and formulate damage-control strategies, the companies that rely on them may be unaware that their own systems are under attack or that their data has been compromised.</p><p>Nathalie Salisbury, Strategic Threat Intelligence Analyst at <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/case-study/novavax" target="_blank">Novavax</a>, says that Recorded Futures <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/third-party-intelligence" target="_blank">Third-Party Intelligence Module</a> shines a light on these risks before vendors disclose them. </p><p>A couple of times now, Recorded Future has alerted us to something prior to the third-party vendor, she said. Thats huge when were trying to protect our data. That gives us an opportunity to launch an investigation and see what the compromised vendor had access to, [what] we need to be concerned about, and [how to] evaluate our overall third-party risk.</p><p>As a result, Recorded Future is a critical part of the teams proactive approach to managing their third-party attack surface, both in evaluating new vendors and continuously monitoring existing ones. </p><h2 id="investbank-continuously-monitors-and-protects-against-vulnerabilities">INVESTBANK Continuously Monitors and Protects Against Vulnerabilities</h2><p><em>Vulnerability Intelligence provides access to a large database of exploits and vulnerabilities so that we can remit them faster and implement compensation controls until a patch is released.</em>  Riyad Jazmawi, Head of Information Security. (Read the full case study <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/case-study/investbank" target="_blank">here</a>).</p><p>Vulnerabilities continue to be one of the top initial access vectors for threat actors. In fact, 2024 might have been a watershed for vulnerability exploitation. When Verizon looked at the critical paths attackers use to initiate breaches, <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/Tdd9/reports/2024-dbir-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf" target="_blank">their research found</a> that vulnerability exploitation grew 3X year-over-year.</p><p>This will come as little surprise to those whove tracked prominent ransomware groups over the past year. The exploitation of Progress Softwares <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/2023-threat-analysis-and-2024-predictions" target="_blank">MOVEit</a> and other Managed File Transfer (MFT) products, such as <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/cleo-mft-cve-2024-50623-vulnerability-analysis" target="_blank">Cleo MFT</a>, have enabled threat actors to successfully pull off a number of large-scale breaches. </p><p><a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/case-study/investbank" target="_blank">INVESTBANK</a> wanted to respond more productively to zero-day exploits and vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild. As a fast-moving organization with many digital services, it needed to ensure that it could maintain continuous awareness of any PoCs or critical vulnerabilities in its tech stack. </p><p>Recorded Futures <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/vulnerability-intelligence" target="_blank">Vulnerability Intelligence Module</a> has helped the company improve its defenses against vulnerabilities.</p><p>Vulnerability Intelligence provides access to a large database of exploits and vulnerabilities so that we can remit them faster and implement compensation controls until a patch is released, said Riyad Jazmawi, Head of Information Security. </p><p>To reduce risk, organizations must have visibility into the vulnerabilities in their tech stacks, and they need the context to make patching prioritization decisions. <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/Tdd9/reports/2024-dbir-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf" target="_blank">Verizon</a> found that it takes 55 days to remediate 50% of CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) once patches become available. </p><p>With Recorded Futures Vulnerability Intelligence, you can pinpoint and take action on vulnerabilities to keep attackers from gaining access to your network and data.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>As a security leader, you need visibility into any first-party or third-party asset that could be targeted and exploited by threat actors  and you need context to understand how to prioritize and mitigate threats.To learn more about how Recorded Future can help you take the next step in strengthening your organizations defenses, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/demo?utm_campaign=demo-button-2023-top-nav-bar&utm_source=recordedfuture&utm_medium=website&utm_content=20231003&utm_term=website" target="_blank">request a custom demo</a>. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Learn about their tactics, impacts, and how to mitigate the risks to media integrity and public trust.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt group logo"></p><h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2><p>The German federal elections, scheduled for February 23, 2025, are the target of malign influence operations linked to Russia and Russia-based actors. As of mid-February 2025, Insikt Group assesses that, despite their persistence, these efforts have very likely not meaningfully altered voter behavior or shaped public opinion in a manner advantageous to Russias broader geopolitical interests, consistent with <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-impact-of-russian-interference-on-germanys-2017-elections/">assessments</a> of Russian meddling attempts in previous German election cycles. </p><p>The influence operations and corresponding networks tracked in this report  Doppelgnger, Operation Overload, CopyCop, Operation Undercut, and the Russia-based Foundation to Battle Injustice  are longstanding and at least partially Kremlin-funded. These operations almost certainly seek to incite and escalate German domestic socio-political conflicts, pollute the German information space by introducing manipulated content, foster criticism of the United States (US) and European Union (EU) and European integration, and undermine North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) cohesion in line with the Kremlins strategic objectives.</p><p>The 2025 German election cycle marks a period of evolution for several of these operations, while core narratives remain unchanged. For example, Doppelgnger and Operation Overload have expanded beyond mainstream social media to Bluesky Social (Bluesky), in an attempt to capture migrating audiences. Doppelgnger and CopyCop have launched new brands and websites to project influence and reinforce messaging in the face of intensified scrutiny of their operations. Operation Overload continues to use artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools, including the use of AI-enabled voice cloning technology to create audio deepfakes, while both Operation Overload and Operation Undercut pose as real news organizations to increase their credibility.</p><p>Despite limited evidence that these operations have meaningfully influenced voter behavior, they still pose broader risks to media integrity and public trust. Narratives undermining election security or integrity could reduce voter turnout, while media engagement with inauthentic content  rather than exposing the tactics behind it  may amplify malign messaging. Regarding Operation Overload specifically, we continue to assess that the potential for significant breakout does exist, as evidenced in the <a href="https://meduza.io/en/feature/2025/02/06/elon-musk-and-trump-jr-repost-fake-e-news-video-about-usaid-created-by-pro-kremlin-disinformation-network">viral spread</a> of a recent video attributed to this network that disparaged the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in social media. To mitigate these risks, media entities, the public sector, and researchers should continue monitoring known influence networks while limiting engagement with operations such as Doppelgnger, Operation Overload, and Operation Undercut. Impersonated organizations should engage takedown services for malicious domains, collaborate with platform trust and safety teams, and proactively detect brand abuse tactics like typosquatting and logo manipulation.</p><h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2><ul><li>The German federal elections are the target of malign influence operations attributed to Russia and Russia-based actors.</li><li>Russia-attributed influence operations have promoted and will very likely continue to support German political parties Russia views as beneficial to its own geopolitical interests, particularly Alternative fr Deutschland (AfD). </li><li>Doppelgnger is very likely exerting influence through at least seven new inauthentic news brands, in addition to the operations persistent media impersonation activities, to exacerbate political fissures and inflame political discourse surrounding European integration, immigration, and economic matters. </li><li>Operation Overloads media impersonations aim to sow distrust among German citizens toward the safety and integrity of voting, attack the characters of key political leaders, and present Germany as a rising hotbed of antisemitism and extremism.</li><li>Insikt Group detected at least 94 new inauthentic websites  whose creation began in November 2024 after the announcement of upcoming snap elections  that we attribute to CopyCop impersonating German-language news websites.</li><li>Following Insikt Groups November 2024 investigation into Operation Undercut, we have observed the network continuing to post German-language content supporting AfD and undermining German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.</li><li>The Foundation to Battle Injustice very likely seeks to undermine the reputations of German political leaders while promoting political platforms aligned with Russian interests through inauthentic investigative articles.</li></ul><h2 id="new-doppelgnger-brands-target-key-german-election-issues">New Doppelgnger Brands Target Key German Election Issues</h2><p>Insikt Group has detected at least eight new websites acting as original news brands, in addition to continued media impersonation with social media promotion, which we attribute to Doppelgnger, a longstanding Russian influence operation. <a href="https://www.disinfo.eu/doppelganger-operation/">Doppelgnger</a> is very likely positioning these newly established websites  previously not linked to the network  to sustain its influence operations targeting European political leadership and to exacerbate political fissures surrounding European integration, immigration, economic matters, and more. Throughout 2024, researchers, government entities, and technology companies <a href="https://www.qurium.org/alerts/exposing-the-evil-empire-of-doppelganger-disinformation/">continued</a> <a href="https://www.qurium.org/forensics/when-kehr-meets-vextrio/">exposing</a> Doppelgnger&#39;s activities across Europe and North America, leading to a US Department of Justice <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-disrupts-covert-russian-government-sponsored-foreign-malign-influence">indictment</a> against its operators at the Social Design Agency (SDA), international sanctions on SDA and affiliated entities, and at least partial  though often temporary  disruptions to its operations through takedowns and seizures. In response, SDA typically attempted to reestablish its operations within hours to days by deploying new infrastructure.</p><p>While Doppelgnger is best known for the <a href="https://www.disinfo.eu/doppelganger/">direct impersonation</a> of legitimate Western media organizations, the influence operation has also managed a multitude of its own original news website brands, each targeting a specific country (such as Germany), with content directly tailored to the key domestic and foreign policy issues of that target audience, such as immigration policy, Germanys ongoing socio-economic challenges, and questions of Germanys place as Europes leader (as seen in <strong>Figure 1</strong>). Insikt Group has observed Doppelgnger abandoning several of its legacy brand websites with attempts to establish new brands, including multiple websites specific to German politics, likely due to a combination of repeated discovery and disruption of several of these websites. </p><p>While we continue to observe Doppelgnger evolve its tactics and attempt to evade defenders, its ability to meaningfully impact public discourse very likely remains limited. Despite continued efforts to expand its network, Doppelgnger remains constrained by low levels of engagement, with minimal views and interactions across its newly launched domains and social media brands.</p><h3 id="using-new-infrastructure-to-deliver-old-themes">Using New Infrastructure to Deliver Old Themes</h3><p>Since October 2024, Insikt Group has tracked a series of new domain registrations, discovering web page infrastructure that overlaps with previously attributed Doppelgnger-controlled domains.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt group logo"></p><h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2><p>Between December 2024 and January 2025, Recorded Futures Insikt Group identified a campaign exploiting unpatched internet-facing Cisco network devices primarily associated with global telecommunications providers. Victim organizations included a United States-based affiliate of a United Kingdom-based telecommunications provider and a South African telecommunications provider. Insikt Group attributes this activity to the Chinese state-sponsored threat activity group tracked by Insikt Group as RedMike, which aligns with the Microsoft-named group Salt Typhoon. Using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group observed RedMike target and exploit unpatched Cisco network devices vulnerable to CVE-2023-20198, a privilege escalation vulnerability found in the web user interface (UI) feature in Cisco IOS XE software, for initial access before exploiting an associated privilege escalation vulnerability, CVE-2023-20273, to gain root privileges. RedMike reconfigures the device, adding a generic routing encapsulation (GRE) tunnel for persistent access.</p><p>RedMike has attempted to exploit more than 1,000 Cisco devices globally. The group likely compiled a list of target devices based on their association with telecommunications providers&#39; networks. Insikt Group also observed RedMike targeting devices associated with universities in Argentina, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Thailand, the United States (US), and Vietnam. RedMike possibly targeted these universities to access research in areas related to telecommunications, engineering, and technology, particularly at institutions like UCLA and TU Delft. In addition to this activity, in mid-December 2024, RedMike also carried out a reconnaissance of multiple IP addresses owned by a Myanmar-based telecommunications provider, Mytel.</p><p>Unpatched public-facing appliances serve as direct entry points into an organizations infrastructure. Sophisticated Chinese threat activity groups have <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2023-1107.pdf">shifted</a> heavily toward exploiting these devices for initial access over the past five years. RedMikes exploitation of telecommunications infrastructure goes beyond technical vulnerabilities and represents a strategic intelligence threat. Persistent access to critical communications networks enables state-backed threat actors to monitor confidential conversations, manipulate data flows, and disrupt services during geopolitical conflicts. RedMikes targeting of lawful intercept programs and US political figures highlights the strategic intelligence objectives behind these operations and the national security threat they pose.</p><p>Organizations, particularly those in the telecommunications industry, must prioritize remediating exposed network devices, as unpatched systems remain a key initial access vector for Chinese state-sponsored threat activity groups. Network administrators should implement strict access controls, disable unnecessary web UI exposure, and monitor for unauthorized configuration changes. Individuals should use end-to-end encrypted communication methods for sensitive information, just as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) recommended, which is crucial to mitigate potential eavesdropping risks.</p><p>Additionally, governments and cybersecurity entities should improve threat intelligence sharing and impose stricter regulatory compliance for network security. While the US sanctions on RedMike-affiliated Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology signal a more assertive and commendable stance against state-backed cyber espionage in critical infrastructure, robust international cooperation is crucial for effectively countering these persistent threats.</p><h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2><ul><li>Despite significant media coverage and US sanctions, RedMike continues to compromise telecommunications providers globally, including in the US.</li><li>RedMike compromised Cisco network devices of a US-based affiliate of a United Kingdom (UK) telecommunications provider and a South African telecommunications provider.</li><li>RedMike exploited privilege escalation vulnerabilities CVE-2023-20198 and CVE-2023-20273 to compromise unpatched Cisco network devices running Cisco IOS XE software.</li><li>Using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified RedMike attempting to exploit over 1,000 Cisco network devices between December 2024 and January 2025.</li></ul><h2 id="background">Background</h2><p>In late September 2024, media reporting (<a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/china-cyberattack-internet-providers-260bd835?st=cYA8J5&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink">1</a>, <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/chinas-salt-typhoon-hacked-att-verizon-report/">2</a>) stated that the Chinese state-sponsored group Salt Typhoon had compromised the networks of major US telecommunications companies, including Verizon (<a href="">1</a>), AT&amp;T, and Lumen Technologies. The activity likely affected telecommunications organizations globally, with some outlets <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/national-security-daily/2024/12/12/we-need-to-talk-about-salt-typhoon-00183727">reporting</a> that Salt Typhoon compromised at least 80 organizations. SaltTyphoon used its access to telecommunications providers to snoop on <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/salt-typhoon-apt-subverts-law-enforcement-wiretapping">US lawful intercept</a> targets and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/25/trump-hack-china-phones-00185608">intercept</a> the communications of significant US political figures. The effect of Salt Typhoons intrusions has reached the highest levels of the US government: Cybersecurity experts have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-agencies-brief-senators-chinese-salt-typhoon-telecom-hacking-2024-12-04/">briefed</a> the US Senate, CISA recently <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/enhanced-visibility-and-hardening-guidance-communications-infrastructure">issued</a> guidance on hardening telecommunications infrastructure, and CISA and the FBI issued a joint <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/12/06/fbi-warns-iphone-and-android-users-stop-sending-texts/">warning</a> encouraging the use of encrypted end-to-end messaging applications for sensitive communications.</p><p>Insikt Group tracks Salt Typhoon-aligned activity as RedMike. Salt Typhoon is a group name given by Microsoft Threat Intelligence; at this time, Microsoft has not published publicly available technical details of the group&#39;s activity. The only public information Microsoft has shared confirms an <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/microsoft-threat-actor-naming">overlap</a> with two existing threat activity group names: GhostEmperor (<a href="https://securelist.com/ghostemperor-from-proxylogon-to-kernel-mode/104407/">Kaspersky</a>) and FamousSparrow (<a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/09/23/famoussparrow-suspicious-hotel-guest/">ESET</a>).</p><p>On January 17, 2025, the US Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2792">sanctioned</a> Sichuan-based cybersecurity company Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology Co., Ltd. for their direct involvement with RedMike activity. OFAC stated that Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology Co., Ltd. had direct involvement in exploiting US telecommunications and internet service provider companies. According to OFAC, Chinas Ministry of State Security (MSS) has maintained strong ties with multiple computer network exploitation companies, including Sichuan Juxinhe.</p><h2 id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis</h2><h3 id="cisco-ios-xe-web-ui-exploitation">Cisco IOS XE Web UI Exploitation</h3><p>Using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified that since early December 2024, RedMike has attempted to exploit over 1,000 internet-facing Cisco network devices worldwide, primarily those associated with telecommunications providers, using a combination of two privilege escalation vulnerabilities: CVE-2023-20198 and CVE-2023-20273. When successfully compromised, the group uses the new privileged user account to change the device&#39;s configuration and adds a GRE tunnel for persistent access and data exfiltration.</p><p>The privilege escalation vulnerability CVE-2023-20198 was found in the Cisco IOS XE software web UI feature, version 16 and earlier, and <a href="https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxe-webui-privesc-j22SaA4z">published</a> by Cisco in October 2023. Attackers exploit this vulnerability to gain initial access to the device and issue a <span style="font-family: Courier;">privilege 15</style> command to create a local user and password. Following this, the attacker uses the new local account to access the device and exploits an associated privilege escalation vulnerability, CVE-2023-20273, to gain root user privileges.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/redmike_salt_01_5eec44df76.png" alt="RedMike Cisco network"><em><strong>Figure 1:</strong> RedMike Cisco network device exploitation infrastructure (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><p>More than half of the Cisco devices targeted by RedMike were in the US, South America, and India. The remaining devices spanned over 100 other countries. Although the selected devices are primarily associated with telecommunications providers, thirteen were linked to universities across Argentina, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Thailand, the US, and Vietnam.</p><p>Often involved in cutting-edge research, universities are prime targets for Chinese state-sponsored threat activity groups to acquire valuable research data and intellectual property. Previous examples include APT40, which has <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa21-200a">targeted</a> universities for biomedical, robotics, and maritime research; RedGolf (APT41) <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/seven-international-cyber-defendants-including-apt41-actors-charged-connection-computer">for</a> medical research; and RedBravo (APT31), which has directly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/apt31-chinese-hacking-group-behind-global-cyberespionage-campaign-2024-03-26/">targeted</a> academics.

Although over 1,000 Cisco devices were targeted, Insikt Group assesses that this activity was likely focussed, given that this number only represents 8% of the exposed devices and that RedMike engaged in periodic reconnaissance activity, selecting devices linked to telecommunications providers.</p><h3 id="compromised-telecommunications-provider-devices">Compromised Telecommunications Provider Devices</h3><p>Using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group observed seven compromised Cisco network devices communicating with RedMike infrastructure. These include devices associated with:</p><ul><li>A US-based affiliate of a UK telecommunications provider</li><li>A US internet service provider (ISP) and telecommunications company</li><li>A South African telecommunications provider</li><li>An Italian ISP</li><li>A large Thailand telecommunications provider</li></ul><p>RedMike configured GRE tunnels between the compromised Cisco devices and their infrastructure. GRE is a tunneling protocol used to encapsulate various network layer protocols inside point-to-point connections. It is a standard feature that can be configured on Cisco network devices. It is commonly used to create virtual private networks (VPNs), enable interoperability between different network types, and transport multicast or non-IP traffic over IP networks. Threat activity groups use GRE tunnels to maintain persistence by establishing covert communication channels that bypass firewalls and intrusion detection systems. These tunnels also facilitate stealthy data exfiltration by encapsulating stolen data within GRE packets, potentially bypassing network monitoring.</p><h3 id="reconnaissance-of-myanmar-telecommunications-provider">Reconnaissance of Myanmar Telecommunications Provider</h3><p>In mid-December 2024, RedMike, from the same infrastructure that exploited the Cisco network devices, performed reconnaissance against multiple infrastructure assets operated by a Myanmar-based telecommunications provider, Mytel, likely including their corporate mail server.</p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-cn-2025-0213.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Learn how North Koreaâs IT workers infiltrate global companies, posing cybersecurity threats, committing fraud, and supporting the regime. Discover key findings and mitigation strategies to safeguard your business.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt_group_logo"></p><h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2><p>In an era in which remote work has become the norm, North Korea has seized the opportunity to manipulate hiring processes, using fraudulent information technology (IT) employment to generate revenue for the regime. North Korean IT workers infiltrate international companies and secure remote positions under false identities. These operatives not only violate international sanctions but also pose severe cybersecurity threats, engaging in fraud and data theft and potentially disrupting business operations.</p><p>Beyond financial fraud, these IT workers have been linked to cyber espionage. Insikt Group tracks PurpleBravo (formerly Threat Activity Group 120 [TAG-120]), a North Korean-linked cluster that overlaps with the Contagious Interview campaign, which primarily targets software developers in the cryptocurrency industry. The campaign employs malware such as BeaverTail, an infostealer that gathers sensitive information; InvisibleFerret, a cross-platform Python backdoor; and OtterCookie, a tool used to establish persistent access on compromised systems. At least three organizations in the broader cryptocurrency space were targeted by PurpleBravo between October and November 2024: a market-making company, an online casino, and a software development company.</p><p>The findings also highlight North Koreas expansion into other areas of fraud, with the establishment of front companies that mimic legitimate IT firms. TAG-121, a separate cluster of activity, has been identified as operating a network of these companies across China. Each front company spoofs a different legitimate organization by copying large parts of their website. These entities create an added layer of deniability and make detection more challenging, allowing North Korean actors to further embed themselves in global IT supply chains.</p><p>The implications of this threat are far-reaching. Organizations that unknowingly hire North Korean IT workers may be in violation of international sanctions, exposing themselves to legal and financial repercussions. More critically, these workers almost certainly act as insider threats, stealing proprietary information, introducing backdoors, or facilitating larger cyber operations. Given North Koreas history of financial theft, the risks extend beyond individual companies to the broader global financial system and national security interests.</p><p>To mitigate these threats, organizations must adopt stringent identity verification measures, ensuring that remote hires undergo thorough screening. This includes requiring video interviews, notarized identification documents, and continuous monitoring of remote workers for anomalies. Employers should also implement technical controls to detect unauthorized access, restrict data exposure, and flag suspicious remote connections. Awareness and training for human resources (HR) teams and IT security personnel are essential in preventing these actors from infiltrating critical business operations.</p><p>While the threat posed by North Korean IT workers is a fraud issue, it is also a key component of a sophisticated cyber strategy that financially sustains an internationally sanctioned regime.

In the indictment, the US DOJ described a six-year scheme in which two US citizens and one Mexican national conspired with North Korean IT workers to remotely work for at least 64 US companies. Payments from ten companies generated at least $866,255 in revenue that was laundered through a Chinese bank account. In addition to the indictment, stories of organizations and individuals that have come across North Korean IT workers can be regularly found in open sources (<a href="https://x.com/zachxbt/status/1824047425822310580">1</a>, <a href="https://sohay666.github.io/article/en/reversing-scam-interview-base-on-js-project.html">2</a>, <a href="https://www.knowbe4.com/press/knowbe4-issues-warning-to-organizations-after-hiring-fake-north-korean-employee">3</a>). Besides sanctions violations, the threat from these workers, whether stealing sensitive data or installing malware on internal systems, presents unique challenges to organizations, especially in remote work environments.</p><p>North Korea remains highly isolated from the outside world due to the regimes strict control over goods, people, and information, as well as international sanctions placed upon the country. Despite this, Pyongyangs leadership is <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/north-korea-internet-activity">well-versed</a> in exploiting emerging technologies to fund its operations. As sanctions have tightened, the regime <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/north-korea-cyber-activity">adapted</a> by escalating illicit activities, including smuggling and cybercrime. In recent years, the regime has achieved significant <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/crypto-country-north-koreas-targeting-cryptocurrency">success</a> in stealing from traditional financial institutions and digital assets like cryptocurrency. Between 2020 and 2024, the rise of remote work created new opportunities for North Korea to deploy skilled IT workers who infiltrate global companies under false identities. Their activities directly support the regimes military programs while posing a significant threat to industries reliant on intellectual property.</p><p>Research into North Korean IT workers has focused on the following aspects of the threat: North Korean IT workers gaining fraudulent <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/mitigating-dprk-it-worker-threat">employment</a> through proxies; North Korean <a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/dprk-it-workers-a-network-of-active-front-companies-and-their-links-to-china/">front companies</a>, often in the software development space, imitating legitimate organizations; and <a href="https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/pyongyang-your-payroll-rise-north-korean-remote-workers-west">fake</a> employment opportunities targeting software developers in cryptocurrency and AI, among other industries. Other research has established <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/fake-north-korean-it-worker-activity-cluster/">links</a> between IT workers and ongoing malicious campaigns by North Korean threat actors. </p><h2 id="threat-analysis">Threat Analysis</h2><h3 id="purplebravo">PurpleBravo</h3><p>The Contagious Interview campaign, first <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/two-campaigns-by-north-korea-bad-actors-target-job-hunters/">documented</a> in November 2023, targeted software developers primarily in the cryptocurrency space and was attributed to North Korea. The campaign used the JavaScript infostealer BeaverTail, the cross-platform Python backdoor InvisibleFerret, and most recently OtterCookie, a new backdoor <a href="https://jp.security.ntt/tech_blog/contagious-interview-ottercookie">identified</a> in December 2024. The group responsible for this activity is known as CL-STA-0240, Famous Chollima, and Tenacious Pungsan in open sources.

An individual claiming to be a recruiter contacted them about a job offer and then followed up with an interview. During the interview, the interviewer asked the developer to download a coding challenge from a repository. The developer realized there was a malicious function in the file and ended the interview. While the developer does not attribute the malware or actor, Insikt Group assesses with high confidence the file is a BeaverTail infostealer.</p><p>The interviewer used a LinkedIn account with the name Javier Fiesco, who describes themself as the CTO of AgencyHill99. Further investigation into Javier Fiesco <a href="https://remote3.co/p/javier0923">uncovered</a> an individual with the same name available for work on remote3, a Web3 development job board. The website <em>agencyhill99[.]com</em> was registered on Hostinger on September 13, 2024.

BeaverTail is a malware family initially distributed via NPM packages as a JavaScript payload and later as executables and downloaders targeting Windows and macOS environments. BeaverTail also acts as an infostealer, gathering cryptocurrency wallet and browser information. InvisibleFerret is a collection of post-compromise payloads that collectively act as a backdoor in victim environments. InvisibleFerret introduces additional malicious payloads into victim environments, performs information stealing and fingerprinting actions within the victim environment, and leverages legitimate protocols and software for C2 communications. Like InvisibleFerret, OtterCookie is a post-compromise malware family used as a backdoor, which establishes C2 connectivity via Socket[.]IO, receives and executes shell commands from C2 servers, and exfiltrates sensitive victim data.</p><p>Insikt Group analyzed BeaverTail, InvisibleFerret, and OtterCookie malware samples (See <strong>Appendix B</strong> for related file hashes). The BeaverTail samples were identified as PE variants targeting Windows environments. These samples included URLs linked to <em>freeconference[.]com</em>, a legitimate conferencing website, which aligns with Unit42s <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/north-korean-threat-actors-lure-tech-job-seekers-as-fake-recruiters/">findings</a> of Contagious Interview payloads posing as FreeConference executables. The OtterCookie samples were two separate versions of the malware family; however, static analysis of these samples included strings that demonstrated both samples ability to gather and send system fingerprinting information to attacker C2 servers, including strings that indicated OtterCookie is capable of identifying cryptocurrency assets and sensitive information found in specific file types by using regex patterns, including executables, photos, and config and env files, among others.</p><p>The InvisibleFerret samples analyzed were Python scripts with the following functionalities: </p><ul><li>Determining victim device location via local IP address lookup</li><li>Fingerprinting device details (user and hostname)</li><li>Connecting to a Base64-encoded C2 address via HTTP POST requests</li><li>Performing local directory discovery using hard-coded strings</li><li>Creating a reverse shell for SSH session management and data exfiltration</li><li>Copying clipboard data, keylogging, and tracking mouse movements.</li></ul><p>Previous samples of InvisibleFerret were <a href="https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/pyongyang-your-payroll-rise-north-korean-remote-workers-west">analyzed</a> by Zscaler, which described a two-part infection chain in which the initial reconnaissance took place over HTTP traffic and FTP was used for data exfiltration, as shown in <strong>Figure 2</strong>.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/purplebravo_02_601227dd0c.png" alt="InvisibleFerret"><em><strong>Figure 2</strong>: InvisibleFerret Infection chain (Source: Recorded Future and <a href="https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/pyongyang-your-payroll-rise-north-korean-remote-workers-west">Zscaler</a>)</em></p><p>Insikt Group identified 21 PurpleBravo servers between August 2024 and February 2025 (see <strong>Appendix B</strong> for the complete list). The majority of servers use Tier[.]Net hosting, with Majestic Hosting, Stark Industries, Leaseweb Singapore, and Kaopu Cloud HK also being used in this campaign. Insikt Group has previously observed other North Korean threat groups favor many of these hosting providers. In addition to the C2 servers, using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group observed at least seven suspected victims between September 2024 and February 13, 2025. The victims are located in at least six countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Costa Rica, India, Vietnam, Trkiye, and South Korea. Open-source <a href="https://spur.us/astrill-vpn-and-remote-worker-fraud/">research</a> identified Astrill VPN as a favored service by North Korean IT workers, with <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/mitigating-dprk-it-worker-threat">evidence</a> that they use the service with remote administration tools. Insikt Group also observed network traffic between known Astrill VPN endpoints and PurpleBravo servers, corroborating this connection.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/purplebravo_03_7060a07d32.png" alt="PurpleBravo victims"><em><strong>Figure 3</strong>: Location of PurpleBravo victims (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><p>At least three victims in the cryptocurrency space were identified in the findings summarized below:</p><ul><li>On October 3, 2024, Insikt Group observed likely reconnaissance traffic between a BeaverTail C2 and a market-making company in the cryptocurrency space based in the United Arab Emirates.

            <description><![CDATA[Prepare your business for potential geopolitical disruptions from a Taiwan invasion. Assess evolving risks, global economic impacts, and strategic measures to safeguard supply chains and critical operations in Asia.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png"></p><h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2><p>Businesses should now begin making preparatory investments to establish contingency plans in case of a Taiwan invasion, especially if they operate in Taiwan or China, rely heavily on supply chains or shipping in Asia, or are located in countries likely to oppose Chinas geopolitical objectives. While an invasion in the short term (20252026) is currently unlikely, the factors informing Insikt Groups assessment are rapidly evolving. Beginning in 2027 and continuing through the long term (20272049), the risk of an invasion will very likely continue to increase, though it is not inevitable that an invasion will occur. In the short term, China is almost certain to continue its current coercive efforts, including major military exercises and incursions into maritime and air spaces near Taiwan, while seeking ways to incrementally escalate such coercion below the level of an invasion. In these efforts, China is likely to initiate a temporary law enforcement-led quarantine and a disruptive cyber campaign against Taiwans critical infrastructure.</p><p>Our assessment is based on a range of behaviors and trends across China, Taiwan, and the United States (US), as described in the <strong>Key Findings</strong> below, and in consideration of Chinas broader geopolitical context (see <strong>Appendix A</strong>). Fundamentally, in the short term, we assess that  absent a specific catalyst that leads to war (such as if Taiwan were to declare formal independence)   the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership is very likely to remain focused on improving domestic conditions and strengthening preparations for navigating tensions with the US, a potential invasion of Taiwan, or other conflict with foreign powers (such as over the South China Sea). In the long term, we assess that China will likely have established a level of preparedness across the military, economic, social, and other domains by 2027 that would enable its leadership to invade Taiwan as a war of choice (rather than in response to a specific catalyst) while minimizing associated costs and risks. </p><p>Our assessment is generally aligned with public statements by Taiwan and US government and military officials since the start of 2023, both of which emphasize active preparations regardless of speculation about specific timelines. More specifically, Taiwan officials express that an invasion is currently unlikely despite the potential for a diversionary war to distract from Chinas domestic economic challenges. They also highlight weaknesses in the Peoples Liberation Armys (PLAs) amphibious capability while recognizing the PLA could likely execute a blockade of Taiwan  the foremost alternative to an invasion. US officials express that an invasion is not imminent or inevitable, but that the risk is increasing and that Chinas forces are on track to meet their modernization and readiness goals. </p><p>An invasion would almost certainly severely impact the global economy, disrupting critical shipping lanes, devastating the semiconductor industry, and imposing broad costs on Taiwan, China, and potentially the US. Businesses likely to be affected by a Taiwan invasion scenario should consider taking steps such as building relationships with potential alternative suppliers outside of Asia, evaluating the purchase of war risk insurance, conducting scenario-based stress tests to identify vulnerabilities in operations and investments, maintaining encrypted offline backups of key computer systems and data, isolating high-value computer systems to limit an adversarys lateral movement in case of a breach, and purchasing a geopolitical threat intelligence capability to support ongoing monitoring of the Taiwan issue (additional recommendations can be found in the <strong>Preparing for Potential Global Economic Disruption</strong> section of this report). Indicators of escalation to support monitoring are provided in <strong>Appendix B</strong>. Given the public focus on the impact of an invasion on Taiwans semiconductor industry, <strong>Appendix C</strong> further offers our assessment of why that industry is not especially relevant to judging if or when China might invade.</p><h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2><p>Assessments supporting our judgment that an invasion is unlikely in the short term include:</p><p>China almost certainly continues to prefer peaceful reunification and very likely continues to invest in a dual-track strategy that combines economic inducements with coercive elements.Chinas economy is facing challenges that are very likely holding the focus of leadership as they strive to attain national rejuvenation. Despite PLA progress in developing capabilities necessary for a successful invasion of Taiwan, Chinas military continues to have limitations in areas that suggest it is not yet ready to undertake an invasion.Chinas leadership has likely not begun telling the public to prepare for war and public support for a war is likely not at levels the CCP would prefer before ordering an invasion. Although long-term public opinion trends in Taiwan are unfavorable to Chinas goals, polling results since 2020 likely suggest to Chinas leadership that its strategy is working to curb preferences for independence in the short term.</p><p>Assessments supporting our judgment of rising risk in the long term include:</p><p>The CCP has become increasingly assertive and very likely expectant of progress with regard to its goals for Taiwan.Under Xi Jinpings leadership, the CCP has taken administrative and other measures to develop a self-sufficient economy, harden against foreign economic coercion such as sanctions, decrease reliance on the US dollar, and prepare for shortages in strategic resources like grain and critical minerals.China-based cyber threat actors are targeting US critical infrastructure in ways that suggest their goal is to pre-position for a potential conflict. Chinas leadership has intensified its use of lawfare measures against Taiwan, particularly over the past year. The PLA, Chinas wider armed forces, and Chinas defense industry are continuing to improve capabilities that would be needed for a successful invasion of Taiwan, countering US intervention, and other scenarios.The political and social environments in Taiwan are both trending toward potentially permanent rejection of unification.Chinas leadership almost certainly perceives US government behavior as trending toward overturning its (the USs) one-China policy, which is one of Beijings likely red lines that could hasten an invasion scenario.</p><h2 id="indicators-an-invasion-is-unlikely-in-the-short-term">Indicators an Invasion Is Unlikely in the Short Term</h2><p>There are several elements of Chinas behavior that support our assessment that a Taiwan invasion is unlikely before 2027. These include Chinas almost certain continuing preference for peaceful reunification, indicators that it very likely continues to pursue a dual-track approach to Taiwan, economic challenges that very likely take priority given Chinas other ambitions, shortfalls in PLA capability, and limited indication that China has begun mobilizing its populace to brace for wartime hardship. Additionally, public opinion polling results in Taiwan since 2020 likely suggest to Chinas leadership that its coercive strategy is working to deter independence in the short term. In totality, we assess that  absent a specific catalyst that leads to war (such as if Taiwan declares formal independence or China assesses foreign military interference in Taiwan)   the CCP leadership is very likely, in the short term, to remain focused on improving domestic conditions and strengthening preparations for navigating tensions with the US, a potential invasion, or other conflict with a foreign power (for example, over the South China Sea).</p><h3 id="trends-in-china">Trends in China</h3><p>China almost certainly continues to prefer peaceful reunification and very likely continues to invest in a dual-track strategy that combines economic inducements with coercive elements.

Chinas challenges include a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/30/chinas-property-market-is-expected-to-stabilize-in-2025-.html#:~:text=China%20Economy-,China's%20property%20market%20is%20expected%20to%20stabilize%20in,but%20stay%20subdued%20for%20years&text=China's%20struggling%20real%20estate%20sector,latest%20stimulus%20measures%2C%20analysts%20predict.">depressed</a> property market, <a href="https://www.fitchratings.com/research/sovereigns/deflation-in-china-risks-becoming-entrenched-05-11-2024">deflation</a>, <a href="https://www.rfa.org/english/china/2024/11/18/china-local-government-hidden-debt-explained/#:~:text=The%20International%20Monetary%20Fund%20estimates,%25%20of%20GDP%2C%20Reuters%20reported.">high</a> local government debt, <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/foreign-investment-in-china-falls-for-past-year-as-economy-struggles/7682513.html">declining</a> foreign investment, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/chinas-youth-unemployment-hits-fresh-high-economic-slowdown-restrictiv-rcna172183">elevated</a> youth unemployment, and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/27/chinas-ambitions-for-chip-self-sufficiency-thwarted-by-lack-of-tools-.html">lingering dependence</a> on critical foreign technology like semiconductor production tools (for more on the relevance of semiconductors in Chinas likely Taiwan invasion calculus, see <strong>Appendix C</strong>), while <a href="https://www.interest.co.nz/public-policy/129617/yuen-yuen-ang-explains-chinas-seemingly-contradictory-trajectory-characterised">shifting</a> toward a green, high-tech structure. These and other challenges have led to arguments that China could invade Taiwan to distract from domestic troubles (<a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/International-relations/Taiwan-tensions/China-could-threaten-war-in-2023-to-force-talks-Taiwan-official">1</a>, <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/china-more-likely-to-invade-taiwan-and-attack-could-come-in-2027-islands-foreign-minister-joseph-wu-warns-12789179">2</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/11/joe-biden-china-economy-time-bomb">3</a>, <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/desperate-times-desperate-measures-slowing-growth-making-china-more-dangerous">4</a>), but this is unlikely. First, diversionary war has not been the CCPs method for <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/myth-chinese-diversionary-war">managing</a> domestic crises since 1949. Second, the economic challenges are likely not great enough to <a href="https://www.prcleader.org/post/getting-to-world-class-can-china-s-military-persevere">derail</a> the PLAs ongoing modernization in ways that would limit Chinas option to use force in the future. During this period, Xi Jinping is very likely to focus on solving domestic economic problems while strengthening the military to support conditions for achieving national rejuvenation by 2049  a goal with an <a href="https://www.strategictranslation.org/glossary/great-rejuvenation-of-the-chinese-nation">economic component</a>  and to prepare for unifying with Taiwan through force if doing so is deemed necessary. </p><p>Despite PLA progress toward developing capabilities necessary for a successful invasion of Taiwan (discussed further below), Chinas military continues to have limitations in areas that suggest it is not yet ready to undertake such a high-risk operation. These limitations very likely include a lack of sealift capacity for an invasion of Taiwan, inadequate rapid runway repair capabilities to <a href="https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/CASI/Display/Article/3430623/the-regenerating-road-chinas-rapid-runway-repair-capabilities-and-other-recover/">restore</a> air operations following enemy assaults, difficulty <a href="https://digital-commons.usnwc.edu/cmsi-maritime-reports/34/">integrating</a> submarine forces into joint operations, and helicopter forces that have readiness and operational capacity limitations. Corruption also <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2024/Dec/18/2003615520/-1/-1/0/MILITARY-AND-SECURITY-DEVELOPMENTS-INVOLVING-THE-PEOPLES-REPUBLIC-OF-CHINA-2024.PDF">continues</a> to be a <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2024/12/can-china-ever-weed-out-corruption-in-its-military/">major challenge</a> for the PLA and Chinas <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2024/09/the-logic-of-chinas-careful-defense-industry-purge/">defense industry</a>, potentially disrupting the militarys organizational command, the quality of its personnel, its preparedness for warfare, and the attainment of its modernization goals. </p><p>Chinas leadership has likely not begun telling the public to prepare for war and public support for a war is likely not at levels the CCP would prefer before ordering an invasion. This point is debated, with some analysts focusing on Xi Jinpings <a href="https://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/research/docs/4_BoilingMoat_Ch1.pdf">warning</a> that the stormy seas of a major test are looming, his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230531131348/http://politics.people.com.cn/n1/2023/0530/c1024-40002443.html">emphasis</a> on worst-case scenario thinking, and the CCPs escalating rhetoric targeting Taiwan. However, when asked about this language during a US Congressional hearing in 2024, multiple experts from the US, India, and elsewhere <a href="https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2024-06/June_13_2024_Hearing_Transcript.pdf">assessed</a> that available evidence likely does not point to warnings of an imminent invasion specifically, but rather to the rising risks of Chinas volatile economic and geopolitical context generally (see <strong>Appendix A</strong>). In particular, these experts <a href="https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2024-06/June_13_2024_Hearing_Transcript.pdf">focus</a> on the lack of state content demonizing Chinas would-be opponents in Taiwan and likely the US. Moreover, only about 50%  at most  of the Chinese public likely supports a use of force to unify Taiwan under certain conditions; Chinas leadership would likely prefer a stronger base of popular support before initiating a high-risk and potentially costly invasion, for reasons related to PLA <a href="https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2024-06/Devin_Thorne_Testimony.pdf">reliance</a> on civilian systems  and because failure could threaten at least the current CCP leadership if not wider party legitimacy (<a href="https://digitalcommons.ndu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1118&context=strategic-forums">1</a>, <a href="https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/JIPA/Display/Article/2444775/the-day-after-the-battle/">2</a>, <a href="https://www.usip.org/publications/2024/11/many-ways-fail-costs-china-unsuccessful-taiwan-invasion">3</a>).</p><h3 id="trends-in-taiwan-and-the-us">Trends in Taiwan and the US</h3><p>Although long-term public opinion trends in Taiwan <a href="https://esc.nccu.edu.tw/PageDoc/Detail?fid=7801&id=6963">indicate</a> the majority of people are very unlikely to ever willingly support unification (discussed later in this report), polling results since 2020 likely suggest to Chinas leadership that the military and other elements of its strategy are working to curb preferences for independence in the short term. Since 2020, support for maintaining the status quo has increased while moving toward independence has trended downward (an uptick in June 2024 notwithstanding). Further, support for maintaining the status quo indefinitely has risen since 2020 from 25.8% to 33.6%. Support for &quot;independence as soon as possible has also fallen from 6.6% to 3.8% in this same period. These results likely decrease the likelihood of an invasion given Chinas very likely preference for solving domestic challenges and further preparing in case an invasion is deemed necessary.</p><p>Insikt Group has not identified any trends in the US that would, in our assessment, decrease the likelihood of invasion in the short term.</p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/ta-cn-2025-0212.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="key-takeaways---what-every-cybersecurity-expert-needs-to-know">Key Takeaways - What every cybersecurity expert needs to know</h2><p>The Space Race 2.0 is well underway and accelerating rapidly. This white paper explores the key components shaping this modern space race and highlights how cyberattacks are already influencing its trajectory. Cyber operations will play a critical role in determining who dominates the second space race. As this new race accelerates, so too will the frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks targeting organisations operating in the space domain. Understanding how cyberattacks are reshaping this race is critical to protecting global economies, military operations, and the future of national security.</p><h2 id="what-is-currently-happening">What is currently happening?</h2><p>Nation-states are swiftly adapting their militaries to compete in space, a largely unregulated domain abundant with resources. History has shown that advanced nations often exploit new frontiers, and space is no exception. With its virtually limitless resources, space has become a critical battleground.</p><p>Earths orbit is already highly contested, hosting satellites essential to global economies and military operations. Many of these satellites have been victims of cyberattacks, a trend that is certain to intensify. However, the focus extends beyond Earths ground stations and orbit, where we see espionage, destructive attacks, supply chain compromise, and signal hijacking. Nation-states are now setting their sights on deeper space, and that is where our attention must also turn.</p><h2 id="what-is-going-to-happen">What is going to happen?</h2><p>The initial stage of Space Race 2.0 centers on Earths orbit, but the Moon, asteroids, and planets hold vast resources with the potential to transform nation-states in ways we can only begin to imagine. Efforts are already underway to colonize the Moon, mine asteroids, and establish a presence on habitable worlds beyond Earth.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/convergence_01_9b26a1d4c5.jpg" alt="Stages of the space race"><em><strong>Figure 1</strong>: Stages of the space race that are unfolding.</em> </p><p>As these ambitions grow, so will efforts to outmaneuver rival nations. Cyber capabilities will play a critical role, as adversaries seek to steal information or disrupt operations. Ground stations, communication signals, and the supply chains supporting space assets are vulnerable to cyberattacks. As such, space-related organisations and companies must prioritize robust cybersecurity measures to protect their operations in this emerging domain. At an operational level, researchers are advancing frameworks like SPARTA to stay ahead of evolving tactics, techniques, and procedures</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/convergence_02_adb7eeb826.png" alt="Space Attack Research &amp; Tactic Analysis"><em><strong>Figure 2</strong>: Space Attack Research &amp; Tactic Analysis (SPARTA) from <a href="https://sparta.aerospace.org/">https://sparta.aerospace.org/</a>.</em></p><p>At the strategic level, industry and government are convening more frequently at conferences like Defence Space 24 to address the growing cyber threats in the space domain.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/convergence_03_ff07053458.png" alt="Defence Space 24"><em><strong>Figure 3</strong>: Defence Space 24 was hosted in London at the end of September 2024. Government, military, and industry representatives attended the event.</em></p><p>At a nation-state level, militaries are increasingly integrating intelligence and cyber capabilities into their space operations, with U.S. Space Command serving as a prominent example.</p><p>ConclusionThis white paper explores the intersection of space exploration and cybersecurity, delving into the challenges and opportunities shaping this evolving frontier. The stakes could not be higher: dominance in cyberspace directly translates to dominance in outer space, where control will determine humanitys future trajectory beyond Earth. As such, the convergence of space and cyber is critical and demands our full attention.</p>]]></content:encoded>

TAG-124 comprises a network of compromised WordPress sites, actor-controlled payload servers, a central server, a suspected management server, an additional panel, and other components. The threat actors behind TAG-124 demonstrate high levels of activity, including regularly updating URLs embedded in the compromised WordPress sites, adding servers, refining TDS logic to evade detection, and adapting infection tactics, as demonstrated by their recent implementation of the ClickFix technique. </p><p>Insikt Group identified multiple threat actors using TAG-124 within their initial infection chains, including operators of Rhysida ransomware, Interlock ransomware, TA866/Asylum Ambuscade, SocGholish, D3F@CK Loader, TA582, and others. Notably, the shared use of TAG-124 reinforces the <a href="https://blog.talosintelligence.com/emerging-interlock-ransomware/">connection</a> between Rhysida and Interlock ransomware, which are already linked through similarities in tactics, tools, encryption behaviors, ransom note themes, code overlaps, and data exfiltration techniques. Insikt Group expects that TAG-124 will continue its operations within the increasingly sophisticated and specialized cybercriminal ecosystem, enhance its effectiveness, and attract additional users and partners.</p><h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2><ul><li>Insikt Group identified multi-layered infrastructure linked to a TDS tracked as TAG-124.

A TDS typically refers to a system used to analyze and redirect web traffic based on parameters like geolocation or device type, funneling only specific visitors to malicious destinations such as phishing sites, malware, or exploit kits, while evading detection and optimizing cybercriminal campaigns. </p><p>More specifically, TAG-124 operates by injecting malicious JavaScript code into compromised WordPress websites. When visitors access an infected website, they unknowingly load attacker-controlled resources designed to manipulate them into completing actions that result in the download and execution of malware. TAG-124 often deceives victims by presenting the malware as a required Google Chrome browser update. </p><p>In more recent variations, TAG-124 has been <a href="https://malasada.tech/updated-landupdate808-analysis/">observed</a> using the ClickFix technique. This approach displays a dialog instructing visitors to execute a command pre-copied to their clipboard. Once a visitor runs the command, it initiates a multi-stage process that downloads and executes the malware payload.</p><h2 id="threat-analysis">Threat Analysis</h2><h3 id="tag-124">TAG-124</h3><p>Insikt Group identified multi-layered infrastructure associated with the TDS TAG-124. This infrastructure comprises a network of compromised WordPress sites, likely actor-controlled payload servers, a central server whose exact purpose remains unclear at the time of analysis, a suspected management server, and an additional management panel. If visitors fulfill specific criteria, the compromised WordPress websites display fake Google Chrome update landing pages, which ultimately lead to malware infections as discussed in the Users of TAG-124 section of this report (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>).</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/tag_124_001_13e664d086.png" alt="TAG-124s high-level infrastructure setup"><em><strong>Figure 1</strong>: TAG-124s high-level infrastructure setup (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><h4 id="compromised-wordpress-websites">Compromised WordPress Websites</h4><p>TAG-124s infrastructure consists of an extensive network of WordPress websites (see <strong>Appendix A</strong>). These websites appear to lack a consistent theme regarding industry, topic, or geography, suggesting they were likely compromised opportunistically through exploits or by acquiring credentials, such as those obtained via infostealers. </p><h5 id="first-stage-wordpress-websites-in-initial-delivery">First-Stage WordPress Websites in Initial Delivery</h5><p>The compromised websites of the first stage in the initial delivery phase typically include a script tag with an async attribute at an arbitrary location in the document object model (DOM), enabling the loading of an external JavaScript file in parallel with the page to avoid rendering delays (see <strong>Figure 2</strong>).</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/tag_124_002_34e39e0a75.png" alt="Script tag in DOM used to load external JavaScript file"><em><strong>Figure 2</strong>: Script tag in DOM used to load external JavaScript file (Source: <a href="https://urlscan.io/result/eaa33803-1435-44c9-949f-3d707f51da4a">URLScan</a>)</em></p><p>The JavaScript filename has changed frequently over time, with earlier names following recognizable patterns (such as <span style="font-family: Courier;">metrics.js</span>) and more recent ones <a href="https://threatfox.abuse.ch/ioc/1353344/">appearing</a> to be randomly formatted (such as <span style="font-family: Courier;">hpms1989.js</span>). Example filenames include:</p><ul><li><span style="font-family: Courier;">3561.js</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Courier;">365h.js</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Courier;">e365r.js</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Courier;">hpms1989.js</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Courier;">metrics.js</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Courier;">nazvanie.js</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Courier;">web-analyzer.js</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Courier;">web-metrics.js</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Courier;">web.js</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Courier;">wp-config.js</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Courier;">wp.js</span></li></ul><p>Notably, the threat actors appear to be regularly updating the URLs on the compromised websites. For instance, the website associated with <em>www[.]ecowas[.]int</em> has consistently changed the URL used to fetch the JavaScript file. This behavior indicates that the threat actors maintain ongoing access to these WordPress sites and frequently alter the URLs, including the domain and JavaScript filename, likely to evade detection.</p><p>Although many of the compromised WordPress websites appear to be associated with lesser-known organizations, Insikt Group identified notable cases, including a subdomain linked to the Polish Centre for Testing and Certification, <em>www[.]pcbc[.]gov[.]pl</em>, and the domain of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) (<em>www[.]ecowas[.]int</em>). Both have been compromised and used in TAG-124 campaigns.</p><h5 id="final-stage-wordpress-websites-in-initial-delivery">Final Stage WordPress Websites in Initial Delivery</h5><p>If visitors meet specific criteria, which could not be fully determined, the compromised WordPress domains typically present fake Google Chrome update landing pages. These pages prompt users to click a download button, triggering the download of the actual payload from designated endpoints on a secondary set of compromised WordPress websites, including but likely not limited to:</p><ul><li><span style="font-family: Courier;">/wp-admin/images/wfgth.php</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Courier;">/wp-includes/pomo/update.php</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Courier;">/wp-content/upgrade/update.php</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Courier;">/wp-admin/images/rsggj.php</span></li></ul><h5 id="fake-google-chrome-update-landing-pages">Fake Google Chrome Update Landing Pages</h5><p>Insikt Group discovered two variants of fake Google Chrome update landing pages associated with TAG-124 (see <strong>Figure 3</strong>).

            <description><![CDATA[Discover key insights from Recorded Future's 2024 report on cyber threats, criminal networks, SaaS identity risks, and strategies for 2025 cybersecurity.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png"></p><h2 id="explore-our-2024-threat-analysis-and-2025-predictions">Explore our 2024 Threat Analysis and 2025 Predictions</h2><p>In 2024, two key trends defined the cybersecurity landscape: the resilience of cybercriminal networks despite law enforcement actions and the growing complexity of enterprise attack surfaces. In addition, state-sponsored threat actors, primarily linked to China and Russia, intensified their focus on critical infrastructure and leveraged generative AI to conduct influence operations to advance their geopolitical objectives.</p><p>Recorded Futures just-released threat report explores these trends and more. It presents the industrys most comprehensive analysis of intelligence from 2024 as well as predictions to prepare your security organization for the year ahead. </p><p>Read on for a summary of key topics and themes, and then <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2025-0128.pdf">download the full report</a> for an in-depth look at the adversarys TTPs so you can strengthen your security posture.  </p><h3 id="top-themes-from-our-2024-research">Top Themes from our 2024 Research</h3><p><strong>Theme #1: Extortion Groups Proliferated Despite Law Enforcement Action</strong></p><p>Despite significant global law enforcement efforts targeting ransomware groups like <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/lockbit-launches-ransomware-blog">LockBit</a> and <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/latin-american-governments-targeted-by-ransomware">ALPHV</a>, cybercriminals demonstrated their ability to adapt and thrive. They reorganized, leveraged leaked malware builders, and shifted to smaller, independent groups. By mid-2024, ransomware payments had already reached $459.8 million, with a record $75 million paid by a single victim. </p><p><strong>Theme #2: Growing Adoption of SaaS Led to More Identity Exploits</strong></p><p>Organizations now use an average of 371 SaaS applications, up significantly from 2021, with each application requiring its own access credentials. This increase in SaaS reliance gave threat actors more opportunities to exploit stolen or exposed credentials, which were implicated in high-profile breaches such as those at Snowflake and Change Healthcare. In both cases, attackers used stolen credentials obtained through infostealer malware to bypass single sign-on (SSO) protections. </p><p><strong>Theme #3: State-sponsored Influence Operations Escalated</strong></p><p>State-sponsored threat actors, including those <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/from-coercion-to-invasion-the-theory-and-execution-of-china-cyber-activity">linked to China</a>, Russia, and Iran, escalated their activities in 2024. These operations targeted critical infrastructure and leveraged generative AI to conduct influence campaigns during key elections.</p><p>Chinas Volt Typhoon group pre-positioned itself in US critical infrastructure, raising concerns about its potential for strategically timed cyberattacks. Meanwhile, Russia and Iran used generative AI to accelerate the creation and dissemination of inauthentic content aimed at influencing public opinion and destabilizing democracies worldwide. </p><p><strong>Theme #4: Tactics and Techniques Emphasized Defense Evasion</strong></p><p>Threat actors increasingly employed advanced tactics to evade detection. Malware targeting macOS and Linux systems surged, reflecting the growing use of these platforms in enterprise environments. Tools like RustDoor and <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/the-travels-of-markopolo-self-proclaimed-meeting-software-vortax-spreads-infostealers">AMOS</a> exploited cross-platform functionality to deliver sophisticated payloads, while ransomware groups targeted critical hypervisors such as VMware ESXi.</p><p>Defense evasion techniques, such as reflective code loading and the abuse of remote monitoring tools, became more prevalent. These methods enabled attackers to bypass endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions.</p><h3 id="top-insikt-group-predictions-for-2025">Top Insikt Group Predictions for 2025</h3><p><strong>#1: AI Impersonation will be the Next Big Attack Vector for SaaS Applications</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/insikt-group">Insikt Group</a> expects that a major breach will very likely result from one of two AI-associated factors: implementation of generative AI into enterprise workflows or abuse of AI for effective impersonation. In either case, it is likely that a SaaS application will play a role in initial access or data exposure.</p><p><strong>#2: Additional Typhoon Activity will Affect New Sectors</strong></p><p>Insikt Group predicts that more high-profile breaches of US critical infrastructure by <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/chinese-apt-groups-target-afghan-telecommunications-firm">China-linked APTs</a> will be disclosed in 2025, expanding beyond the energy and telecommunications sectors. These breaches are likely aimed at pre-positioning for disruptive operations.</p><p><strong>#3: macOS and Mobile Threats Join Windows and Cloud</strong></p><p>Insikt Group forecasts that one of the high-impact cyber incidents of 2025 will likely be associated with either macOS malware or mobile malware. This will result from certain environmental factors reaching breaking points, such as higher attention to macOS targets and increased access to sensitive corporate and financial data via mobile devices.</p><p><strong>#4: Crypto Fraud Will Lead to a Market-destabilizing Event</strong></p><p>The soaring value of cryptocurrency, as well as an incoming US administration set to pursue crypto-friendly policies, will drive more aggressive and ambitious fraud attempts. Inskit Group predicts that criminals will likely be emboldened by the crypto boom to carry out market-destabilizing scams that will at least temporarily reduce the value of cryptocurrencies and lead to calls to restrict their use.</p><h3 id="get-the-2024-recorded-future-annual-report-today">Get the 2024 Recorded Future Annual Report Today</h3><p>Download the report to access the complete set of research themes and predictions plus detailed analysis.

            <description><![CDATA[Between July 2023 and December 2024, RedDelta, a Chinese state-sponsored group, targeted Mongolia, Taiwan, and Southeast Asia using advanced spearphishing campaigns with evolving infection chains and the PlugX backdoor.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png"></p><h2 id="summary">Summary:</h2><p>Between July 2023 and December 2024, Insikt Group observed the Chinese state-sponsored group RedDelta targeting Mongolia, Taiwan, Myanmar, Vietnam, and Cambodia with an adapted infection chain to distribute its customized PlugX backdoor. The group used lure documents themed around the 2024 Taiwanese presidential candidate Terry Gou, the Vietnamese National Holiday, flood protection in Mongolia, and meeting invitations, including an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) meeting. RedDelta likely compromised the Mongolian Ministry of Defense in August 2024 and the Communist Party of Vietnam in November 2024. The group conducted spearphishing targeting the Vietnamese Ministry of Public Security, but Insikt Group observed no evidence of  successful compromise. From September to December 2024, RedDelta likely targeted victims in Malaysia, Japan, the United States, Ethiopia, Brazil, Australia, and India.</p><p>In late 2023, RedDelta evolved the first stage of its infection chain to leverage a Windows Shortcut (LNK) file likely delivered via spearphishing. In 2024, the group transitioned to using Microsoft Management Console Snap-In Control (MSC) files. Most recently, RedDelta used spearphishing links to prompt a victim to load an HTML file remotely hosted on Microsoft Azure. Since July 2023, RedDelta has consistently used the Cloudflare content distribution network (CDN) to proxy command-and-control (C2) traffic, which enables the group to blend in with legitimate CDN traffic and complicates victim identification. Other state-sponsored groups, including Russias BlueAlpha, have similarly leveraged Cloudflare to evade detection.</p><p>RedDeltas activities align with Chinese strategic priorities, focusing on governments and diplomatic organizations in Southeast Asia, Mongolia, and Europe. The groups Asia-focused targeting in 2023 and 2024 represents a return to the groups historical focus after targeting European organizations in 2022. RedDeltas targeting of Mongolia and Taiwan is consistent with the groups past targeting of groups seen as threats to the Chinese Communist Partys power.</p><h2 id="about-reddelta">About RedDelta:</h2><p>RedDelta has been active since at least 2012 and has focused on targeting Southeast Asia and Mongolia. The group has routinely adapted its targeting in response to global geopolitical events. <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/reddelta-targets-catholic-organizations">RedDelta targeted the Vatican and other Catholic organizations</a> with PlugX before 2021 talks between China  and the Vatican. The has group <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/reddelta-cyber-threat-operations">compromised</a> law enforcement and government entities in India, a government organization in Indonesia, and other targets across Myanmar, Hong Kong, and Australia.</p><p>In 2022, <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/reddelta-targets-european-government-organizations-continues-iterate-custom-plugx-variant">RedDelta shifted toward increased targeting of European government and diplomatic entities</a> following Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine. This activity used an infection chain that began by delivering an archive file (ZIP, RAR, or ISO), which was likely delivered via spearphishing. The file contained a Windows Shortcut (LNK) file disguised with a double extension (such as .doc.lnk) and a Microsoft Word icon. Hidden folders within the archive contained three files used to complete dynamic-link library (DLL) search order hijacking: a legitimate binary, a malicious DLL loader, and an encrypted PlugX payload that was ultimately loaded into memory. User execution of the Shortcut file led to DLL search order hijacking. In November 2022, RedDelta evolved its tactics to stage the ISO file on a threat actor-controlled domain.</p><p>In March 2023, Insikt Group identified RedDelta targeting Mongolia using a similar infection chain that started with a container file (RAR, ZIP, ISO) consisting of an LNK file that triggered a DLL search order hijacking triad located within a hidden nested subdirectory. Decoy documents included an invitation from the World Association of Mongolia and a document claiming to be a BBC news interview about Tibetan Buddhism and Mongolia. RedDelta targeted: </p><ul><li>Members of multiple Mongolian non-governmental organizations (NGOs), including a human rights and pro-democracy NGO focused on the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region</li><li>Mongolian Buddhist activists in Mongolia and Japan</li><li>Academic professionals in Mongolia and Japan</li><li>Developers of two Mongolian mobile applications</li></ul><h2 id="mitigations">Mitigations:</h2><p>To detect and mitigate RedDelta activity, organizations should:</p><ul><li>Use YARA and Sigma rules provided by Insikt Group to detect RedDelta Windows Installer (MSI), DLL, and LNK files (see below).</li><li>Configure intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), and other network defense mechanisms to alert on or block connection attempts from external IP addresses and domains associated with RedDelta (see below).</li><li>Keep software and applications  particularly operating systems, antivirus software, and core system utilities  up to date.</li><li>Filter email correspondence and scrutinize attachments for malware.</li><li>Conduct regular system backups and store them offline and offsite to ensure they are inaccessible via the network.</li><li>Adhere to strict compartmentalization of company-sensitive data, institute role-based access, and limit company-wide data access.</li><li>Deploy client-based host logging and intrusion detection capabilities to identify and thwart attacks early.</li><li>Prevent threat actors from bypassing security by disabling outdated authentication methods.</li><li>Implement tools like network IDS, NetFlow collection, host logging, and web proxy, alongside manual monitoring of detection sources.</li><li>Practice network segmentation and ensure special protections exist for sensitive information, such as multifactor authentication, and restricted accesss.</li></ul><p>Leverage the <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/third-party-intelligence">Recorded Future Third-Party Intelligence module</a> and <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform/browser-extension">Threat Intelligence Browser Extension</a> for real-time monitoring and prioritized vulnerability patching.</p><p>Review public guidance (<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-158a">1</a>, <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-144a">2</a>, <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2019/Oct/07/2002191601/-1/-1/0/Mitigating%20Recent%20VPN%20Vulnerabilities%20-%20Copy.pdf">3</a>, <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa20-258a">4</a>) and Insikt Groups <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/charting-chinas-climb-leading-global-cyber-power">Charting Chinas Climb as a Leading Global Cyber Power</a> report for comprehensive recommendations for mitigating Chinese advanced persistent threat activity more broadly.</p><h2 id="outlook">Outlook:</h2><p>Insikt Group anticipates that RedDelta will continue targeting organizations worldwide with its customized PlugX backdoor, focusing on Southeast Asia and Chinas periphery, including Mongolia and Taiwan.

            <description><![CDATA[A new report by Recorded Futureâs Insikt group finds that countries across Central Asia and Latin America are increasingly basing their digital surveillance practices on Russia's System for Operative Investigative Activities (SORM). Learn more about the privacy and security risks, as well as risks to corporate organizations operating in these regions. ]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png"></p><h2 id="summary">Summary:</h2><p>Several countries in Central Asia and Latin America almost certainly base their digital surveillance capabilities on Russias System for Operative Investigative Activities (SORM), indicating that Russian surveillance technology has proliferated in Russias near abroad and among its allies. Insikt Group identified evidence of at least eight SORM providers exporting to these regions, with at least fifteen telecommunications companies as likely customers. The largest Russian SORM providers like Citadel, Norsi-Trans, and Protei, export and participate in trade expositions across Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East, highlighting efforts to further expand globally. While these systems have legitimate security applications, the governments outlined in this report have a history of misusing surveillance capabilities , including repression of political opposition, journalists, and activists, without effective or independent oversight. SORM facilitates interception of a wide range of internet and telecommunications traffic by authorities without the knowledge of the service providers themselves, reducing transparency and oversight of surveillance operations and increasing opportunities for abuse. Companies operating in or looking to establish physical operations in these countries should assess surveillance risks and adopt privacy tools like encryption and VPNs  to the extent permitted by local law  to mitigate sensitive communications being intercepted.</p><h2 id="what-is-sorm">What is SORM?</h2><p><a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/russia-ukraine-cyber-front">Russias SORM</a> underpins the <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2021-0909.pdf">Russian Federations electronic surveillance apparatus</a>, which involves all telecommunications and ISP companies installing monitoring equipment under strict government oversight. Security and intelligence services gain direct access to telecommunications traffic passing through the installed equipment, bypassing service providers, who are not authorized to access information regarding interceptions. SORM has evolved from intercepting landline and mobile communications to monitoring internet traffic, Wi-Fi, and social media, with the latest iteration (SORM-3) enabling the collection and long-term storage of traffic and subscriber metadata in a searchable database. This system allows law enforcement authorities and security services to filter data by identifiers such as phone numbers, geolocations, IP addresses, and usernames, all supported by legal frameworks mandating compliance. The nature of SORMs integration into telecommunications and internet infrastructure facilitates potential interception and reduces visibility into surveillance operations, raising the risk of abuse, especially in countries with limited or nonexistent oversight.</p><h2 id="risk-of-russian-government-access">Risk of Russian Government Access</h2><p>Foreign deployments of SORM-based surveillance systems using Russian-manufactured components likely entail a risk of Russian access, given the close ties between SORM providers and the Russian government and the likely high value of information intercepted via these systems. Previous cases, such as the suspected exploitation of Kaspersky exports, support the assessment that Moscow can likely access exported SORM technologies. In <a href="https://www.bis.gov/press-release/commerce-department-prohibits-russian-kaspersky-software-us-customers">June 2024</a>, the US Department of Commerces Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) prohibited Kaspersky Lab from providing technologies and services in the US or to US persons, citing several factors of &quot;unacceptable&quot; risk to national security. Similar concerns apply to SORM providers, such as Citadel, which has been tied to Russian security services, specifically the Federal Security Service (FSB), and oligarchs close to President Vladimir Putin. Citadels major role in the consolidation of the Russian SORM market also underscores likely connections to the Russian government. Notably, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan have raised concerns about backdoors in SORM equipment, with evidence suggesting that Russian manufacturers maintained access to systems deployed abroad.</p><h2 id="mitigations">Mitigations</h2><p>Companies operating in countries using SORM-based systems should mitigate the risk of interception by securing online communications with reputable encryption tools, avoiding services on hosting providers with top-level domains of these countries, limiting or removing access to sensitive corporate data during travel, and conducting comprehensive assessments of state digital and physical surveillance capabilities, focusing on evidence of malign misuse against business travelers.</p><p>In this report, Insikt Group has provided a list of indicators that companies can use to assess data privacy and surveillance risk in the context of SORM. While none of these factors guarantee a country uses SORM, the presence of several indicators is indicative of a higher state surveillance risk, including imports from known Russian SORM providers, legislation requiring the installation of interception technologies akin to SORM, joint telecommunications projects with Russian SORM providers, state control over telecommunications infrastructure, reports of intrusive or malign surveillance, and restrictions on encryption technologies. <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/geopolitical-intelligence">Recorded Futures Country Risk feature</a> offers regularly updated analysis and mitigation guidance for assessing such risks.</p><h2 id="outlook">Outlook</h2><p>The marketing materials and trade show participation of major SORM providers suggest that these organizations will very likely continue to seek opportunities for foreign expansion. Countries with close ties to Russia  especially those with histories of cybersecurity or intelligence cooperation or joint projects in the telecommunications sphere  will likely continue to source digital surveillance components from Russian providers. SORM deployments in these regions will almost certainly continue to present data security risks, particularly where oversight of government surveillance is weak. More broadly, the export of Russian surveillance technologies will continue to offer Moscow opportunities to expand its influence, particularly in its &quot;near abroad&quot;, and potentially enhance intelligence collection capabilities, though the degree of potential access is unclear.</p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/ta-ru-2025-0107.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year, our Hispanic Heritage Month program features a three-part series led by <a href="https://notainclusion.com/">Nota Inclusion</a> speakers. Futurists are invited to participate in virtual development sessions covering themes like overcoming adversity, unlocking personal potential, and harnessing the power of connection.</p><p><a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/erg-stories-hispanic-heritage-month-2024">In part one</a>, Mando Origel, Recorded Futures Latin Network ERG lead and Customer Success Manager, shared his inspiration for organizing these events and what he felt was the most important part of the ERG work: making meaningful connections. </p><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/0pcwi2fsf2.jsonp" async></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script><div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;"><div class="wistia_embed wistia_async_0pcwi2fsf2 seo=true videoFoam=true" style="height:100%;position:relative;width:100%"><div class="wistia_swatch" style="height:100%;left:0;opacity:0;overflow:hidden;position:absolute;top:0;transition:opacity 200ms;width:100%;"><img src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/0pcwi2fsf2/swatch" style="filter:blur(5px);height:100%;object-fit:contain;width:100%;" alt="" aria-hidden="true" onload="this.parentNode.style.opacity=1;" /></div></div></div></div><p><em>Transcript: When you share your story, a lot of people can identify with it. And therefore, you know, you break that barrier of fear thats behind being authentically you. Hopefully, thats been the results, you know, where people can feel like they can be authentic at work, where they can bring their culture, their traditions, and really help everybody learn about one another. When people feel like they belong, theyre more willing to be themselves. And when youre yourself, you bring that authenticity which spreads like wildfire.</em></p><p>This November, Futurists completed part two of the series - a practical and interactive session where they reflected on their paths, feelings, and vision for their year to come through that same notion and concept of authenticity and connection.</p><p>We talked to them to understand their experiences and takeaways following the Creating Your Limitless Life workshop! </p><p>I found the Collective Power event to be a valuable opportunity to share and learn practical strategies for life management. Hearing about the positive goals others have set was inspiring, and it was encouraging to explore new approaches to achieve those goals. Overall, the experience was both enlightening and up-lifting. - Peter Barry, Office Operations Coordinator - Somerville</p><p>The Collective Power series was the most impactful self-reflection exercise I&#39;ve had the privilege to experience. The facilitators were awesome in sparking conversations where we felt comfortable sharing both personal and professional development ideas. I now have a true understanding of what I accomplished in 2024, and manageable expectations for myself and others in 2025. - Kim Stone, Sr. Program Manager, Customer Success</p><p>I found the Collective Power series to be empowering and enabling. It was reassuring to meet with other coworkers who are dealing with obstacles that life throws at them and hearing how everyone is coping and thriving despite those challenges. I learned resilience techniques and felt encouraged and less alone as a result. It was a great way to connect on a human level with my coworkers. - Charity Wright, Principal Threat Intelligence Consultant</p><p>Stay tuned for the third and final part of this series in 2025.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Hundreds, if not thousands, of scam websites are connected to these merchants.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/fraud_funding_image1_68d61a2cfe.jpg" alt="fraud-funding-image1.jpg"><em>A scam website snapshot.</em> </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/fraud_funding_image5_2cdfd29303.jpg" alt="fraud-funding-image5.jpg"><em>A victim articulates why Camhubstore is a scam site.</em> </p><p>These merchant accounts that process payments for fraudulent, non-existent goods are tied to the 12th floor of the San Toi Building as the registered business address. The address is even placed directly on some of the sites as a contact address. Heres where it gets interesting. The address is listed on the <a href="https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id=46352">U.S. Treasury OFAC list</a> for ties to an <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1932">Iranian terrorism group</a>. </p><p>The 12th floor is presumably large enough to house <a href="https://www.importyeti.com/supplier/fenglong-art">multiple businesses</a> and likely sufficiently small such that <a href="https://www.importyeti.com/addresses/supplier/12-f-san-toi-building-137-139-connaught-road-central">businesses transit through</a> reasonably often. Of course, it would be difficult to draw a direct connection between these merchant accounts and terrorism based on a shared space address. Still, other questions remain, namely: how are these scam merchants acquiring the ability to process payment cards when their physical address is on the OFAC list? </p><h2 id="remedying-aml--kyc-compliance-failures">Remedying AML / KYC Compliance Failures</h2><p>Knowing your customer (KYC) might be difficult when bad actors go to great lengths to obscure their identity and purpose, but this is an egregious case of acquiring banks and payment processors missing obviously <a href="https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/nodes/292373?e=true">problematic</a> contact details.</p><p>Geoff Whites book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lazarus-Heist-Based-hit-podcast/dp/0241554276/"><em>The Lazarus Heist</em>, documented that even routine checks can lead to better outcomes</a>. In it, White details North Korean hackers&#39; inability to transfer a more significant amount (hundreds of millions of dollars) from Bangladesh Bank to a bank branch in Manila because the branch is located on Jupiter Street, and &quot;Jupiter is also the name of a sanctioned Iranian shipping vessel. Addresses matter. </p><p>Suppose the US <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/crypto-banks-relationship-trump-administration-414ff706">pursues a more friendly regulatory environment</a> for cryptocurrencies under President Trump, and exchanges find it easier to acquire bank accounts. In that case, the <a href="https://intelligence2risk.substack.com/p/from-crypto-to-fiat-sneaky-ways-cybercriminals">potential for money laundering</a> may explode without rigorous AML / KYC / KYT efforts. The SEC may have fewer teeth, but banks and processors are still gambling if anyone can obtain a merchant account with little to no compliance checks. </p><p>Indeed, the business incentives are aligned to offer maximum merchant accounts to generate more processing fees, and historically, compliance costs have eroded profitability. However, this may be an emerging opportunity for GenAI. Semi-autonomous agents trained to flag basic AML violations (for example, website contact details listed on OFAC, perhaps) and elastic agents that deploy on demand when a new merchant application is submitted would assist AML compliance efforts and help the financial services industry grappling with a tsunami of fraudulent merchant transactions. </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/fraud_funding_image3_c710d76671.png" alt="fraud-funding-image3.png"></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Discover the rising costs of data breaches, including disruption, legal risks, and lost trust. Learn proactive steps to protect your business from escalating threats.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recorded Futures Insikt Group identified a 76% increase in publicly reported data breaches from 2022 to 2023. While 2024 data is not yet complete, Recorded Future data on validated data breaches project a further 5% increase in 2024 compared to 2023. The scale of this increase in the past two years invites a sense of urgency and concern, especially when the attack surface for data breaches is moving further out of companies control. Based on what we can measure, the costliest impacts of data breaches in the last several years have been operational disruption, legal risks, and declining sales due to churn and loss of customer trust. However, the real risk lies in companies falling behind in their security strategy and failing to adopt a new way of thinking. Our immediate and long-term solutions provide a starting point for effectively addressing this escalating threat. </p><h2 id="data-breaches-are-on-the-rise">Data Breaches Are on the Rise</h2><ul><li>The industries most affected by the 76% increase in data breaches in 2023 were the healthcare, finance, information technology and software, insurance, and manufacturing sectors.</li><li>The insurance sector saw the largest increase in reported data breaches in 2023, with a 178% increase. This was followed by healthcare with a 107% increase and manufacturing with an 81% increase. The sensitivity of these industries data and the cost of disruption to their operations have likely been driving factors for threat actors to target these industries.</li></ul><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/data_breaches_chart_b8e601b5a0.png" alt="Figure 1: Publicly reported data breaches in the top five affected industries In 2022 compared to 2023 (Source: Recorded Future)"><em>Figure 1: Publicly reported data breaches in the top five affected industries In 2022 compared to 2023 (Source: Recorded <a href="https://app.recordedfuture.com/live/sc/1ObI7GMg9WD3">Future</a>)</em></p><h2 id="the-costs-of-data-breaches-continue-to-be-high">The Costs of Data Breaches Continue to be High</h2><ul><li>Research from <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">IBM shows</a> that the average total cost of a data breach reached an all-time high in 2024 of USD 4.88 million. </li><li>The business impacts of data breaches are often easiest to measure right after a breach is detected, such as the four-day outage at an Australian personal loan provider in early 2023 that <a href="https://investors.latitudefinancial.com.au/DownloadFile.axd?file=/Report/ComNews/20230316/02644401.pdf">resulted</a> in what we estimate could have been a revenue disruption of over $6 million USD while security teams mitigated the breach. </li><li>However, impacts can also linger: In Q4 of 2023, after a US genetics testing company confirmed it had been hit by a major data breach, it saw <a href="https://investors.23andme.com/news-releases/news-release-details/23andme-reports-fy2023-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-financial">decreased sales</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/.IXIC:INDEXNASDAQ?window=1Y&comparison=NASDAQ%3AME">underperformed</a> the Nasdaq by approximately 16%. While it was not the only factor at play, the negative media coverage around the data breach is highly likely to have played a role in stock, sales, and revenue underperformance, especially when considered in the context of the <a href="https://connect.sustainalytics.com/hubfs/INV/Thought%20Leadership/Sustainalytics_The%20Impact%20of%20Cyberattacks%20on%20Stock%20Prices_Sep%202022.pdf">extensive</a> <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">literature indicating</a> how cyberattacks can negatively impact stock prices.</li></ul><h2 id="the-causes-are-moving-further-out-of-control">The Causes Are Moving Further Out Of Control</h2><ul><li>As the costs of a data breach increase, the causes of breaches are also moving further out of organizations control. Companies may have robust vulnerability remediation on their infrastructure and devices, but threat actors are increasingly looking for vulnerabilities in third-party software to gain access to more potential victims1. Third-party software providers are critical components of the software supply chain and may not have effectively identified or addressed these vulnerabilities. This lack of remediation exposes the entire ecosystem to heightened risks of compromise, as reliance on <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/outcomes/supply-chain">third-party software expands the attack surface</a>.</li><li>As more and more data is likely hosted on third-party cloud providers, threat actors are abusing exposed administrative accounts (<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/">Valid Accounts</a>) to gain privileged access and exfiltrate data more effectively.  Recorded Futures 2023 Annual Report <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/2023-annual-report">highlighted</a> a 22% increase in validated cyberattacks leveraging the Valid Accounts technique. Based on initial analysis of 2024 data, threat actors continue to abuse valid accounts at various stages of an attack sequencesuch as discovery, privilege escalation, and defense evasionto facilitate data theft. These accounts enable lateral movement within networks to access sensitive systems, facilitate reconnaissance by appearing as normal user activity, and help blend into regular traffic to avoid triggering security alerts.</li></ul><h2 id="getting-ahead-of-the-problem">Getting Ahead of the Problem</h2><p>One immediate action security teams can take to improve their organizations risk profile is to create a vendor catalog to identify all external parties with access to company data. Use of risk management software, such as Recorded Futures <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/data-sheets/third-party-intelligence.pdf">Third-Party Intelligence Module</a>, enables extended visibility across the entire third-party ecosystem to uncover risk exposures and prioritize risk mitigation. </p><p>More long-term actions can also be helpful in mitigating the chances or severity of a data breach: </p><ul><li><a href="https://www.immuta.com/blog/what-is-data-tokenization/">Tokenization</a> or encryption helps to render sensitive data meaningless or inaccessible, respectively, outside of a secure environment. Organizations can reduce exposure to risks associated with storing sensitive data and maintain compliance with data privacy laws and regulations by implementing the appropriate method. An audit of necessary tasks associated with data, and not just the sensitivity of data itself, can help with applying the principle of least privilege effectively. </li><li>Close collaboration between multiple teams   forensics, incident response, and legal and compliance  can more successfully manage the fallout from potential data breaches. If these teams do not already have a good working relationship, chances are low that they will automatically have one in response to a severe and public data breach. As a result, it is a good idea for these teams to know each other well outside of a crisis.</li></ul><p>1 Sources: H1 2024: <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2024-0910.pdf">Malware and Vulnerability Trends Report</a>, <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/enhanced-ransomware-solution-announcement">Recorded Future Ransomware Solution</a>, <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/2024/results-and-analysis-intro/">Verizon 2024 Results and Analysis</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

These centers aim to amplify the Chinese Communist Party&#39;s (CCP) voice on the international stage, <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/elephants-street-dance-chinese-communist-party-appeal-youth-overseas-propaganda">targeting specific audiences</a> with tailored messaging (a strategy known as precise communication). ICCs coordinate local, national, and international resources to build China&#39;s image, share political narratives, and promote economic partnerships.</p><p>By leveraging inauthentic social media amplification, foreign influencers, and collaborations with overseas media, ICCs advance <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/china-propaganda-targets-bbc-uk">Chinas multi-layered propaganda</a> approach. For instance, Fujian&#39;s ICC reportedly manages TikTok accounts targeting Taiwanese audiences, likely including a covert account that is highly critical of the Taiwan government called Two Tea Eggs. On YouTube, the same ICC promotes videos of Taiwanese individuals praising China. These centers are strategically positioned to promote China&#39;s interests during geopolitical crises, despite challenges like limited credibility and resource constraints.</p><h2 id="breaking-the-circle-chinese-communist-party-propaganda-infrastructure-rapidly-expands">Breaking the Circle: Chinese Communist Party Propaganda Infrastructure Rapidly Expands</h2><p><a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/chinas-narrative-war-democracy">China&#39;s efforts to reshape global narratives</a> about its policies, culture, and geopolitical aims have reached new heights with the rapid proliferation of international communication centers (ICCs). Established to amplify the voice of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), these centers are integral to <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/1-key-for-1-lock-chinese-communist-party-strategy-targeted-propaganda">China&#39;s global propaganda apparatus</a> and seek to propel the CCPs precise communication strategy for targeting distinct audiences. Heres a closer look at their functions, strategies, and implications.</p><h2 id="what-are-iccs">What Are ICCs?</h2><p>ICCs are propaganda hubs designed to bring new resources to the CCPs efforts to tell Chinas story by centralizing and streamlining the capabilities of provinces, cities, and smaller jurisdictions. These centers focus on building China&#39;s global image by sharing positive narratives about its culture, economy, and development. Simultaneously, they act as a conduit for political narratives aimed at countering negative perceptions and promoting China&#39;s geopolitical agenda.</p><p>Over 100 ICCs have been established across China, primarily since 2023, under provincial and sub-provincial propaganda departments and state media organizations. These centers aim to &quot;break the circle&quot; to penetrate foreign audiences and tailoring content for specific regions and demographics.</p><h2 id="key-objectives-of-iccs">Key Objectives of ICCs</h2><p>ICCs primarily aim to promote positive narratives about China. They create content that highlights the countrys cultural heritage, technological innovations, and economic progress, fostering goodwill among international audiences. Additionally, ICCs counter negative narratives by responding to perceived anti-China sentiments and disseminating content to influence public opinion on geopolitical topics. By tailoring their approaches to specific regions and demographics, ICCs strive to ensure their narratives resonate more effectively. For example, Fujians ICC specifically targets Taiwanese audiences using TikTok accounts that blend cultural themes with critical political messaging.</p><h2 id="tactics-and-strategies">Tactics and Strategies</h2><p>ICCs employ various tactics to achieve their objectives. <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/china-social-media-operations">Social media operations form a core component of their strategy</a>, with thousands of accounts active across platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok. Many of these accounts lack transparency about their state affiliations, enabling covert influence campaigns. Additionally, ICCs leverage foreign influencers and communication officers to amplify Chinas narratives through user-generated content, vlogs, and experiential propaganda.</p><p>Collaboration with overseas media organizations further enhances ICCs&#39; reach and legitimacy. Through actions like organizing foreign journalist visits to China, ICCs create an impression of organic coverage and offer an alternative to Western narratives. These partnerships  reportedly established in Australia, Brazil, Cambodia, Egypt, France, Japan, Russia, the United States, and elsewhere  are complemented by localized propaganda activities that align with Chinas economic and geopolitical interests. S</p><h2 id="challenges-to-success">Challenges to Success</h2><p>Despite ambitious goals, ICCs face significant challenges that hinder their effectiveness. These include a lack of professional and foreign talent, insufficient discourse power, inadequate data for precise communication, and inconsistent funding. ICCs often struggle to translate local developments into effective narratives for foreign audiences and lack focus on target demographics. Many rely heavily on central state media infrastructure, as seen with the Nanning International Communication Center outsourcing key operations to Xinhua News Agency. These limitations echo long-standing issues within China&#39;s state media sector.</p><h2 id="implications">Implications</h2><p>ICCs represent a sophisticated evolution in China&#39;s propaganda efforts. While they are unlikely to become trusted sources of information in the near term, their ability to amplify preferred narratives during geopolitical crises is likely significant. These centers likely have the potential to influence foreign opinion of China by offering regular engagement, providing alternatives to Western sources, and focusing on topics like quality of life in China rather than political values, especially among Global South and Western periphery audiences.</p><h2 id="outlook">Outlook</h2><p>The expansion of international communication centers (ICCs) reflects China&#39;s ongoing efforts to innovate its media strategy, centralize resources, and project global narratives favoring its interests under Xi Jinping&#39;s leadership. Despite challenges, ICCs likely strengthen China&#39;s ability to influence global discourse by leveraging thousands of overt and covert social media accounts and fostering collaborations with foreign media. These centers could amplify assertive messaging during crises and suppress negative coverage of China.</p><p>China&#39;s long-term goal is almost certainly to establish ICC-affiliated platforms as trusted sources of information. While this remains unlikely in the near term due to credibility challenges, ICCs represent a strategic step toward improving Chinas external propaganda system. Researchers and governments should prioritize tracking ICC activities and advocating for transparent labeling of their state affiliations on social media platforms.</p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/ta-cn-2024-1210.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png"></p><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>Scam websites have emerged as a significant threat in financial fraud, leveraging seasonal opportunities and advanced tactics to deceive cardholders and evade bank defenses. Recorded Future&#39;s Payment Fraud Intelligence team has identified that threat actors operate these scams across five stages: procurement, lure creation, delivery, website setup, and monetization. They exploit psychological triggers and seasonal trends like holidays and shopping events to maximize victim susceptibility.</p><p>Key methods include phishing kits, fraudulent merchant accounts, and live admin panels that enhance the effectiveness of scams while complicating detection. Threat actors use techniques such as typosquatting, malvertising, and smishing to deliver scam lures, while their websites are designed to trick victims into sharing sensitive information.</p><h2 id="scam-websites-understanding-the-threat-and-combating-fraud">Scam Websites: Understanding the Threat and Combating Fraud</h2><p>Scam websites have become a growing concern in recent years, posing risks not only to individual cardholders but also to financial institutions and merchants. These websites, often indistinguishable from legitimate platforms, exploit seasonal opportunities and sophisticated tactics to defraud victims at scale. This research explores how scam websites operate, the methods used by threat actors, and actionable strategies for mitigation.</p><h2 id="stages-of-scam-website-operations">Stages of Scam Website Operations</h2><p>Scam website operations follow five distinct stages:</p><ol><li><strong>Procurement</strong><br>Threat actors gather resources such as domains, phishing kits, and fraudulent merchant accounts. Seasonal trends play a significant role, with typosquatting and scam kits tailored to holidays or shopping events like Black Friday.</li><li><strong>Lure Creation</strong><br>Scammers design lures that exploit urgency and trust. Common methods include brand impersonation, limited-time offers, and fear tactics during tax season.</li><li><strong>Lure Delivery</strong><br>Lures are distributed through online ads, smishing (SMS phishing), and phishing emails. Social media and search engines are frequently exploited for large-scale delivery.</li><li><strong>Website Setup</strong><br>Scam websites mirror legitimate sites to deceive victims into entering sensitive data. Payment forms and account update requests are designed to appear authentic.</li><li><strong>Monetization</strong><br>Threat actors leverage stolen data for card-not-present (CNP) fraud, resale on dark web forums, or fraudulent transactions through merchant accounts.</li></ol><p>Seasonal trends significantly increase the effectiveness of scam websites. Holidays, tax filing periods, and shopping events create urgency among victims, making them more likely to fall for scams. For example, Black Friday scams use high discounts to lure victims, while tax season scams exploit fear of penalties.</p><p>Sophisticated methods like live admin panels and payment cloaking make scams harder to detect. Live admin panels allow real-time interception of victim data and OTPs (one-time passwords), enabling high-success fraud.</p><p>Additionally, threat actors use fraudulent merchant accounts linked to scam websites, allowing immediate monetization and recurring charges. These tactics complicate fraud detection and recovery efforts for banks and cardholders alike.</p><h2 id="mitigation-strategies">Mitigation Strategies</h2><p>To combat scam websites, both financial institutions and individuals must take proactive measures:</p><ul>        <li><strong>For Financial Institutions:</strong></li>    <ul>        <li>Monitor dark web forums for phishing kits and merchant account offerings.</li>        <li>Educate customers about common scam tactics and encourage reporting.</li>        <li>Leverage <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/payment-fraud-intelligence">Recorded Future Payment Fraud intelligence</a> (PFI) to detect and mitigate possible scam websites using the PFI common-point-of-purchase (CPP) dataset.</li>        <li>Leverage <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/brand-intelligence">Recorded Future Brand Intelligence</a> to detect and mitigate brand impersonation threats common among scam websites.</li>    </ul></ul>    <ul>        <li><strong>For Individuals:</strong></li>    <ul>        <li>Verify website URLs and use only trusted platforms for transactions.</li>        <li>Avoid acting on unsolicited offers or advertisements without verification.</li>        <li>Report suspected scams to banks and dispute fraudulent charges promptly.</li>    </ul></ul><h2 id="outlook">Outlook</h2><p>Scam website operations are rapidly evolving, with threat actors adopting sophisticated tactics reminiscent of early Magecart e-skimmer methods. Notable developments include scam campaigns targeting mobile users to evade detection and using low-value transactions to establish trust before initiating high-value fraud. Fraudulent merchant accounts, linked to scam websites, have become a key innovation, enabling immediate and recurring monetization while complicating detection.</p><p>This method is likely to grow in prominence, especially as future PCI-DSS v4.0 requirements limit other fraud techniques. However, regulatory measures like the US FTC&#39;s &quot;click-to-cancel&quot; rule and stricter Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols could significantly curb these operations by addressing loopholes that scammers currently exploit.</p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2024-1126.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png"></p><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>Operation Undercut is a covert influence operation conducted by Russias Social Design Agency (SDA) to sway public opinion against Ukraine and weaken Western support. Leveraging AI-enhanced videos and impersonating reputable news sources, Operation Undercut disseminates disinformation targeting audiences across the US, Ukraine, and Europe. This operation, running in tandem with other campaigns like <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/russian-influence-network-doppelgangers-ai-content-tactics">Doppelgnger</a>, is designed to discredit Ukraines leadership, question the effectiveness of Western aid, and stir socio-political tensions. The campaign also seeks to shape narratives around the 2024 US elections and geopolitical conflicts, such as the Israel-Gaza situation, to deepen divisions.</p><h2 id="operation-undercut-shows-multifaceted-nature-of-sdas-influence-operations">&quot;Operation Undercut&quot; Shows Multifaceted Nature of SDAs Influence Operations</h2><p>Russia&#39;s Social Design Agency (SDA) has been running an influence operation known as &quot;Operation Undercut&quot; since late 2023, aiming to <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/russia-seeks-exploit-western-war-fatigue-win-ukraine">erode Western support for Ukraine</a>. Using a mix of AI-enhanced media and impersonation tactics, Operation Undercut employs advanced methods to manipulate public opinion. </p><h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2><p>Operation Undercut is part of Russia&#39;s broader strategy to destabilize Western alliances and portray Ukraines leadership as ineffective and corrupt. By targeting audiences in Europe and the US, the SDA seeks to amplify anti-Ukraine sentiment, hoping to reduce the flow of Western military aid to Ukraine. The operation also spreads narratives that suggest US and EU involvement in Ukraine is misguided, costly, and largely ineffective.</p><p>In addition to undermining support for Ukraine, Operation Undercut <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/russian-information-operations-divide-western-coalition-ukraine">seeks to widen existing divisions within Western societies</a>. The campaign addresses several geopolitical issues, such as the Israel-Gaza conflict, the EU&#39;s internal politics, and the <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/malign-influence-threats-mount-ahead-us-2024-elections">2024 US elections</a>. By connecting Ukraine&#39;s fate to these contentious topics, Operation Undercut attempts to stoke anxieties and polarize public opinion.</p><h2 id="tactics-techniques-and-procedures-ttps">Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)</h2><p><strong>AI-Enhanced Videos and Impersonation of News Outlets</strong></p><p>Operation Undercut uses <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/adversarial-intelligence-red-teaming-malicious-use-cases-ai">AI-enhanced videos and images, many of which mimic trusted media sources</a>, to make disinformation appear credible. AI-generated voiceovers and realistic images amplify these narratives, creating content that is difficult to distinguish from legitimate news. By adopting branding elements from respected outlets, the operation enhances its contents believability, misleading audiences and eroding trust in genuine media sources.</p><p><strong>Targeted Social Media Campaigns</strong></p><p>SDA&#39;s accounts post highly tailored content on multiple platforms, often using trending hashtags to reach target audiences. The content varies by region and language, including posts in English, German, French, Polish, and Turkish, ensuring that messages resonate across diverse audiences. By focusing on real-time issues, the operation maximizes its reach, though most posts have shown limited engagement.</p><p><strong>Amplification of CopyCop Content</strong></p><p>Operation Undercut has amplified content from <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/copycop-expands-to-cover-us-elections-target-political-leaders">CopyCop (also known as Storm-1516), a Russian influence network</a> linked to John Mark Dougan and allegedly backed by Alexander Dugin&#39;s Centre for Geopolitical Expertise (CGE) and the GRU&#39;s Unit 29155. Examples include a <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/deepfakes-id-verification">deepfake video</a> featuring a supposed Hamas member threatening the 2024 Paris Olympics and an image accusing Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky of buying an Italian villa during the 2024 G7 summit.</p><h2 id="key-narratives">Key Narratives</h2><p><strong>Discrediting Ukraine and Western Aid</strong></p><p>One of Operation Undercuts primary themes is discrediting Ukraines leadership and questioning the effectiveness of Western aid. The campaign accuses Ukrainian leaders of corruption, claiming they misuse foreign aid to fund luxurious lifestyles. This narrative aims to undermine public support for continued financial and military assistance to Ukraine, particularly among European audiences.</p><p><strong>Exploiting the Israel-Gaza Conflict</strong></p><p>The operation also attempts to manipulate public opinion regarding the Israel-Gaza conflict, alleging Western bias and intelligence manipulation. By highlighting divisive issues in global politics, Operation Undercut creates distractions and deepens divides, weakening Western alliances and distracting from Russia&#39;s involvement in Ukraine.</p><p><strong>Tensions Within the EU and US Election Influence</strong></p><p>Operation Undercut amplifies existing political tensions within the European Union by supporting far-right narratives and criticizing EU leaders. Similarly, it seeks to influence the 2024 US elections by framing military aid to Ukraine as a contentious political issue. By presenting Ukraines future as contingent on US election outcomes, the operation fosters anxiety over the West&#39;s political stability.</p><h2 id="mitigations">Mitigations</h2><ul><li>News organizations should track content from known influence actors who are likely abusing their brand. Such abuse increases reputational risks and erodes consumer trust, potentially deterring advertisers and inflicting financial harm on the impersonated organizations.</li><li>Political leaders and government officials from countries providing support to Ukraine should continue monitoring for content attempting to discredit them to identify and counter emerging narratives.</li><li>Public and news organizations can use <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/brand-intelligence">Recorded Future Brand Intelligence</a> to track and combat typosquatting domains and infringing content on similar domains, which can harm a news organizations reputation.</li><li>Clients can use the <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform/intelligence-cloud">Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud</a> to track Operation Undercut activity and Recorded Future AI to summarize and track emerging narratives.</li></ul><h2 id="outlook">Outlook</h2><p>The SDA is expected to continue running influence operations, including Operation Undercut, while likely rebuilding infrastructure for Doppelgnger and using established content and amplification tactics. Tasked by Russias Presidential Administration, these operations aim to shape global opinions on Ukraine and exploit major events to undermine support for Ukraine. The investigation, which uses data from Recorded Future, government sources, and other reports, underscores the value of a collaborative approach across sectors to expose and disrupt these destabilizing activities. </p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/TA-RU-2024-1126.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Using custom malware tools HATVIBE and CHERRYSPY, TAG-110 primarily attacks government entities, human rights groups, and educational institutions. The campaigns tactics align with the historical activities of UAC-0063, attributed to Russian APT group BlueDelta (APT28). HATVIBE functions as a loader to deploy CHERRYSPY, a Python backdoor used for data exfiltration and espionage. Initial access is often achieved through phishing emails or exploiting vulnerable web-facing services like Rejetto HTTP File Server.</p><p>TAG-110s efforts are likely part of a broader Russian strategy to gather intelligence on geopolitical developments and maintain influence in post-Soviet states. Insikt Group provides actionable insights, including indicators of compromise and Snort and YARA rules, to help organizations.</p><hr><h2 id="russia-aligned-tag-110-targets-asia-and-europe-with-hatvibe-and-cherryspy">Russia-Aligned TAG-110 Targets Asia and Europe with HATVIBE and CHERRYSPY</h2><p>Advanced persistent threat (APT) groups aligned with nation-states continue to execute sophisticated campaigns to fulfill strategic objectives. Insikt Group recently identified a Russia-aligned cyber-espionage campaign conducted by TAG-110 targeting organizations across Central Asia, East Asia, and Europe. This group deploys custom malware, including HATVIBE and CHERRYSPY, to conduct operations aligned with Russian geopolitical interests.</p><h3 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h3><ul><li><strong>TAG-110 Overview:</strong> A threat group overlapping with UAC-0063, TAG-110 is linked to the Russian APT group BlueDelta (APT28) with moderate confidence.</li><li><strong>Targets:</strong> Governments, human rights groups, and educational institutions in Central Asia and neighboring regions.</li><li><strong>Malware Used:</strong> HATVIBE, a custom HTML application loader, and CHERRYSPY, a Python-based backdoor, are central to the campaign.</li><li><strong>Scale of Impact:</strong> Since July 2024, 62 victims across eleven countries have been identified, with notable incidents in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan.</li></ul><h3 id="hatvibe">HATVIBE</h3><p>HATVIBE serves as a loader for deploying additional malware like CHERRYSPY. Delivered via malicious email attachments or exploited web-facing vulnerabilities, it achieves persistence through scheduled tasks executed by the mshta.exe utility.</p><p>HATVIBEs obfuscation techniques include VBScript encoding and XOR encryption. Once deployed, it communicates with command-and-control (C2) servers using HTTP PUT requests, providing critical system details.</p><h3 id="cherryspy">CHERRYSPY</h3><p>CHERRYSPY, a Python-based backdoor, complements HATVIBE by enabling secure data exfiltration. It uses robust encryption methods, including RSA and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), to establish communication with its C2 servers. TAG-110 uses CHERRYSPY to monitor victims systems and extract sensitive information, often targeting government and research entities.</p><h3 id="campaign-objectives">Campaign Objectives</h3><p>TAG-110s activities align with Russias geopolitical objectives, particularly in Central Asia, where Moscow seeks to maintain influence amid strained relations.

            <description><![CDATA[From Magecart to Mobile Menaces]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Editor&#39;s note: The following blog post originally appeared on <a href="https://intelligence2risk.substack.com/">Levi Gundert&#39;s Substack page</a>.</strong></em></p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/9530ea14_3d82_4c7a_beac_a3260db82f1b_1024x1024_1284675518.webp" alt="9530ea14-3d82-4c7a-beac-a3260db82f1b_1024x1024.webp"></p><p><a href="https://cxotoday.com/specials/gartner-why-cyber-fraud-fusion-is-the-future-of-online-fraud-detection/">Gartner estimates</a> that 5% of large enterprises currently maintain cyber-fraud fusion centers, which is expected to jump to 20% by 2028. Fusion sounds high speed, but bringing together multiple teams for a shared mission can slow down operations if not managed effectively. A traditional <a href="https://www.comptia.org/content/articles/what-is-a-security-operations-center">SOC</a> masquerading as a fusion center with little more than <a href="https://threatbutt.com/map/">pew pew maps</a> (not to diminish their effectiveness with executives) defeats the purpose. A successful fusion center removes data silos and works across traditionally divided teams (e.g., Incident Response, Cyber Threat Intelligence, Fraud)  to improve threat actor campaign analysis and reduce losses. Cyber-fraud fusion centers improve communication and collaboration through organizational (and perhaps physical) proximity, leading to better fraud loss reduction outcomes. </p><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>Before exposing cyber-fraud data flows and focused loss mitigation examples, a few words about the problem and a prerequisite for success. In January, Nasdaq released a <a href="https://ir.nasdaq.com/news-releases/news-release-details/nasdaq-releases-first-global-financial-crime-report-measuring">remarkable report</a> that quantified illicit money movement, including losses from fraud scams and bank fraud schemes accounted for nearly $500 billion globally in 2023. That number is a significant enticement for threat actors to continue with successful tactics while also investing in new fraud innovations. </p><p>A thriving fusion center requires a leader with vision and experience (in cyber defense operations and fraud) and the mandate authority (juice) to remove traditional enterprise barriers (organizational empire building, information gatekeeping, vendor firewalling, etc.). </p><h2 id="improved-data-driven-workflows">Improved Data-Driven Workflows</h2><p>The fusion concept is vital in this fraud context because CTI analysts generally focus on identifying malicious fraud communities and associated TTPs (tools, tactics, procedures). Fraud analysts, conversely, are concerned with creating fraud analytics toward enhanced remediation. In traditional organizations, the CTI and fraud teams sit in separate departments and are constrained by politically driven data silos.  Optimized information workflows for maximum fraud impact remain elusive. When implemented correctly, cyber-fraud fusion centers remove perverse incentives and enable a unified team to make the organization more effective. </p><p>In each of these examples, well examine how CTI can enrich fraud investigations and help shift from a reactive to a proactive posture (though overused, this proactive notion is appropriate here).</p><h2 id="example-alpha---payment-cards">Example Alpha - Payment Cards</h2><p>A straightforward example includes payment card fraud (card present - CP and card not present - CNP). CTI teams will identify and collect in criminal forums, marketplaces, and other communities where stolen full or partial payment card details are advertised and sold. </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/1f81209f_bc4c_4662_b3d9_c6a17381ef73_1304x569_345c0e0036.webp" alt="1f81209f-bc4c-4662-b3d9-c6a17381ef73_1304x569.webp"></p><p><em>An example database of stolen payment cards.</em> </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/535efde5_1747_44a8_b9d0_bd0e4034c0dc_495x656_c8efd83945.webp" alt="535efde5-1747-44a8-b9d0-bd0e4034c0dc_495x656.webp"></p><p><em>Stolen payment card services branding.</em></p><p>A fraud team workflow may include:</p><ul><li>Identify at-risk cards and monitor the associated portfolio exposure in real time</li><li>Track fraud mitigation turnaround time as a primary KPI (key performance indicator). </li><li>Reduce criminal interest in specific payment card portfolios</li><li>Decrease false-positive rates in risk-scoring solutions</li><li>Conduct CPP (common point of purchase) analysis before chargeback data arrives</li></ul><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/5436d892_398d_443a_b3f6_8d891ec8d80e_2145x396_eb07654c2a.webp" alt="5436d892-398d-443a-b3f6-8d891ec8d80e_2145x396.webp"></p><p><em>A Telegram-sourced conversation - courtesy of Recorded Future - regarding defeating fraud detection mechanisms.</em></p><p>Commonly used fraud controls include KYC (Know Your Customer) rules, test transaction monitoring (a strong fraud precursor signal), CAMS (Compromised Account Management Systems) alerts, and CPP (common point of purchase) analysis. The issue is that all of these controls are reactive. CTI, when done well, changes the paradigm in that intelligence is proactively driving fraud prevention, reducing the efficacy of fraudster tactics, and traditional fraud controls become deprecated as a first line of defense. </p><h2 id="example-beta---pii--ato">Example Beta - PII &amp; ATO</h2><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/cb68aecb_6515_45cc_a06f_914f86d9cdd2_2145x1393_dc05e28a4d.webp" alt="cb68aecb-6515-45cc-a06f-914f86d9cdd2_2145x1393.webp"></p><p><em>Recorded Future AI insights and cashout service branding.</em></p><p>Some organizations (e.g., retailers) may not issue payment cards, but experience heavy fraud losses due to the unauthorized access of personally identifiable information (in the U.S., valuable PII for fraud may include: physical address, email address, date of birth, social security number, phone number, mothers maiden name, etc.), which is subsequently used to tailor social engineering attacks that lead to account takeover (ATO). This is also true for banks. A stolen payment card may be quickly identified and re-issued, but the associated stolen PII may lead to fraud losses through call center social engineering and/or online channel security bypass. The unauthorized access to online accounts may lead to unauthorized money movement to mules who specialize in maintaining bank accounts to receive stolen funds and cash out.</p><p>In another life, working with banks, we engaged fraudsters online to identify previously dormant cash-out accounts. At the time, even if a victim wasnt participating in online account access, fraudsters would enroll victims using stolen PII and create the necessary authentication details (username, password, etc.). Out of convenience, all compromised accounts contained the same password. </p><p>ATO mechanisms include MFA prompt fatigue (the victim is tired of selecting no and seeing a dialogue prompt reappear), <a href="https://therecord.media/hackers-breached-california-state-welfare">credential stuffing / brute forcing</a>, social engineering, <a href="https://therecord.media/sec-twitter-account-hack-arrest-alabama">SIM swapping</a>, password resets, etc. Naturally, GenAI is reducing the time to prepare and deliver while increasing the quality of <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/qr-code-and-ai-generated-phishing-proliferate">social engineering campaigns</a>. ATO and associated cashout techniques are constantly changing. Fraud professionals collaborating with CTI will help identify the right threat actors for engagement to further intelligence objectives that lead to fraud control improvements. </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/521d5535_f191_49e8_ba94_b72acbb73d69_1600x853_0ccd523888.webp" alt="521d5535-f191-49e8-ba94-b72acbb73d69_1600x853.webp"></p><p><em>An infostealer coterie - Lumma, Vidar, Raccoon, Redline.</em></p><p>Additionally, infostealers (a specific label for a malware genus focused on extracting all victim PII and more from web browsers) have stolen billions of victim credentials, cookie values, and more. This data treasure trove enables fraudsters to use valid credentials and quickly achieve ATO for both social engineering and direct money movement in financial services platforms.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/d5587f91_764b_4ee8_99b5_fc179997512d_1525x959_1087a20ab1.webp" alt="d5587f91-764b-4ee8-99b5-fc179997512d_1525x959.webp"></p><p><em>Recorded Future AI Insights for ATO channels.</em></p><h2 id="focused-examples">Focused Examples</h2><p><strong>Example Charlie - Magecart Compromised Merchants</strong></p><p><a href="https://therecord.media/canadas-largest-alcohol-retailer-infected-with-card-skimming-malware-twice-since-december">Magecart</a> is the label for specific malicious scripts (code) loaded into vulnerable e-commerce platforms to skim payment card details during customer payment. As previously mentioned, Magecart victims may have to consider more than just replacing their payment cards in <a href="https://substack.com/@intelligence2risk/note/c-73182811">certain shopping contexts</a>. </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/0c4e1515_0f4f_49a7_8a9b_7bf43759b661_1600x674_16619fe6a3.webp" alt="0c4e1515-0f4f-49a7-8a9b-7bf43759b661_1600x674.webp"></p><p><em>A Magecart data flow diagram.</em></p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/f94439ab_c01b_49de_99b0_778eac9a338f_975x535_5b2b7e6213.webp" alt="f94439ab-c01b-49de-99b0-778eac9a338f_975x535.webp"></p><p><em>Details of e-skimmer code illustrating customer fields for exfiltration.</em></p><p>Proactive Magecart intelligence is important for e-commerce retailers and financial services companies advising and alerting retailers, specifically small and medium-sized companies with fewer resources to invest in security. Magecart TTP evolutions require corresponding agile detections. Several historical Magecart operating changes observed by Recorded Futures Payment Fraud Intelligence (PFI) team include:</p><ul><li>Using Google Tag Manager</li><li>Payment card data exfiltration to Telegram </li><li>Hiding malicious scripts within SVG elements and using stenography</li><li>Using compromised websites as proxies to distribute malicious payloads</li></ul><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/5627b94a_8ab0_4f08_915e_d67e1e8a22f8_1183x808_f7f9ed594d.webp" alt="5627b94a-8ab0-4f08-915e-d67e1e8a22f8_1183x808.webp"></p><p>Fraud teams can track the monetization paths and timelines post-compromise, while CTI teams can actively help identify magecart-victimized merchants before the monetization clock starts. </p><p><strong>Example Delta - Scam Merchants</strong></p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/7b868a76_5e3d_41a8_bd37_336998c1b4ed_2145x972_18a6e4265a.webp" alt="7b868a76-5e3d-41a8-bd37-336998c1b4ed_2145x972.webp"></p><p><em>A verified scam retail website.</em></p><p>A comprehensive strategy to uncover scam merchants involves open-source research, collaboration with industry partners, and advanced data analysis. Organizations can source suspicious websites by monitoring social media advertisements, reviewing domain registration details, and investigating patterns in merchant account behavior. Further validation of potential scam websites can be achieved by correlating domain data with cards exposed on the dark web, identifying common patterns across fraudulent sites, and leveraging consumer reports of suspicious activity. By integrating these insights, organizations can avoid emerging threats and effectively mitigate payment fraud risks.</p><p><strong>Example Echo - Android Banking Trojans</strong></p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/c03e972d_e0d3_438d_a8d2_8b5a9a2c1195_657x548_ddeb83cead.webp" alt="c03e972d-e0d3-438d-a8d2-8b5a9a2c1195_657x548.webp"></p><p>Mobile malware is particularly pernicious in retail banking geographies outside of North America. Recorded Future observes thousands of malicious files with anti-virus signature names like <a href="https://app.recordedfuture.com/portal/intelligence-card/kDbVGx/overview">Hydra</a>, <a href="https://app.recordedfuture.com/portal/intelligence-card/ppu8fm/overview">Hook</a>, <a href="https://app.recordedfuture.com/portal/intelligence-card/jtLozO/overview">Sova</a>, and more every quarter. For example, <a href="https://thethaiger.com/hot-news/bank-of-thailand-warns-of-elevated-financial-cybercrime-risk">Thailand has been alerting</a> citizens to the dangers of installing unverified Android applications, which could drain their bank accounts. While mobile malware generally contains <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/predator-spyware-operators-rebuild-multi-tier-infrastructure-target-mobile-devices">many features</a> (e.g., accessing location services, camera snooping, reading/sending SMS, etc.) that achieve device takeover (DTO), creating <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Man-in-the-browser_attack">man-in-the-browser (MitB)</a> capabilities during online banking sessions is the most impactful for fraud losses because traditional <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/blogs/threat-session-hijacking-mfa-bypass">multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a> mechanisms become less effective when all communications channels can be intercepted and manipulated, leading to account takeover (ATO). </p><p>Again, while financial services fraud teams and government investigators have digital exhaust to follow after victimization, CTI teams should create alerts and dissect new mobile malware TTPs to better educate the banking and online shopping public (and pursue attribution). </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/c2bb4a00_97c2_4e27_9e36_d74fec23fe3d_1050x481_cdc65cd849.webp" alt="c2bb4a00-97c2-4e27-9e36-d74fec23fe3d_1050x481.webp"></p><p><em>A sample of malware tags derived from <a href="https://tria.ge/">Hatching Triage</a>.</em></p><p>Additionally, real-time notification of new mobile malware samples with associated meta-data improves bank prevention/detection systems via atomic indicators (e.g., user-agent strings, IP addresses, etc.) and internal log correlation. </p><p><strong>Example Foxtrot - Stolen Checks</strong></p><p>Physical (paper) checks are a relic of the banking system employed primarily in North America. Because these documents contain a routing and account number, they are still heavily used in <a href="https://abc7ny.com/check-washing-fraud-scam-money/12925374/">fraud</a>. Older generations are vulnerable as they may <a href="https://www.atlantafed.org/-/media/documents/banking/consumer-payments/research-data-reports/2020/02/13/us-consumers-use-of-personal-checks-evidence-from-a-diary-survey/rdr2001.pdf">prefer checks</a> for a reliable payment mechanism over other <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/payment-methods/2022/why-fintechs-are-turning-paper-checks-into-money-mobility-instruments/">fintech options</a>, which are perceived as potentially less reliable. </p><p>The CTI opportunity is to use <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/optical-character-recognition">optical character recognition (OCR)</a> for check image recognition in online criminal communities and proactively work with a fraud team to neutralize the inevitable fraud before victims report it. </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/31102a54_a814_49a8_a8c2_9da1be6c3d4a_1200x1595_d241c26fb1.webp" alt="31102a54-a814-49a8-a8c2-9da1be6c3d4a_1200x1595.webp"></p><p><em>Stolen checks are shared in an online criminal community.</em></p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Strong leadership, clear expectations, and success measures are prerequisites for cyber-fraud fusion centers.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png"></p><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>Russia is likely ramping up its sabotage operations across Europe, targeting critical infrastructure to destabilize NATO allies and disrupt their support for Ukraine. Recent incidents, including break-ins at water treatment facilities in Finland and explosions at arms factories in Poland, highlight Russias use of gray zone tactics to undermine Western military, economic, and political capabilities without crossing the threshold of open conflict. Insikt Groups analysis identifies a pattern of Russian hybrid warfare involving covert operatives, agent networks, and plausible deniability tactics that echo Soviet-era sabotage strategies. With these tactics, <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/russia-seeks-exploit-western-war-fatigue-win-ukraine">Russia aims to degrade NATOs capacity to support Ukraine</a>, increase internal tensions, and strain emergency resources.</p><h3 id="russian-sabotage-activities-escalate-amid-fraught-tensions">Russian Sabotage Activities Escalate Amid Fraught Tensions</h3><p>As tensions between Russia and NATO remain high, Russia is very likely expanding its sabotage operations across Europe, with a focus on undermining NATOs support for Ukraine. These covert activities align with Russias broader hybrid warfare strategy, aiming to destabilize NATO countries, weaken their military capabilities, and strain political alliances. Recent incidents analyzed by Insikt Group reveal the calculated and persistent nature of Russian sabotage, using covert operatives, agent networks, and plausible deniability to avoid direct attribution.</p><h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2><p>Since <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/executive-overview-of-russian-aggression-against-ukraine">Russias invasion of Ukraine in 2022</a>, European governments have increasingly reported suspected sabotage activities linked to Russia. This gray zone warfare includes operations that damage critical infrastructure without escalating to open conflict. Russia perceives itself as being in a passive phase of war with NATO countries due to their military support for Ukraine, thus justifying these low-profile but effective actions as part of a broader strategy to weaken adversaries.</p><h3 id="recent-incidents-of-sabotage">Recent Incidents of Sabotage</h3><p>In June 2024, Insikt Group identified several incidents across six European countries bordering Russia that align with <a href="https://therecord.media/alarm-over-russia-sabotage-europe-spreads">Russian sabotage tactics</a>:</p><ul><li><strong>Finland:</strong> Break-ins at water treatment facilities were reported, raising concerns about potential contamination and public safety risks. These breaches are indicative of economic sabotage targeting essential resources.</li><li><strong>Poland:</strong> Explosions at the Mesko arms factory and fires at the Broad Gauge Metallurgy Line transshipment terminal caused significant disruptions. Given the strategic importance of these facilities in supplying arms to Ukraine, these incidents are likely intended to hinder NATOs logistical support to Ukraine.</li><li><strong>Norway:</strong> Multiple arson attacks on vehicles and fires at critical transport hubs have disrupted infrastructure, increasing operational strain on local authorities.</li></ul><p>These incidents exemplify Russias likely objectives: to degrade NATO&#39;s operational readiness, overwhelm emergency response systems, and create an atmosphere of insecurity among European populations.</p><h3 id="russian-sabotage-tactics">Russian Sabotage Tactics</h3><p>Russian sabotage activities rely on techniques that ensure plausible deniability. Intelligence networks recruit agents, often disaffected individuals or groups, who can execute these operations without drawing direct links to the Russian state. For example, covert operatives may infiltrate target nations under civilian covers, such as tourists or diplomats, or recruit local agents to avoid suspicion.</p><p>Russian sabotage tactics can be categorized into three groups:</p><ul><li><strong>Economic sabotage</strong>: Targeting infrastructure essential to economic stability, such as water treatment facilities and supply chains</li><li><strong>Military sabotage</strong>: Disrupting arms production, transportation, and military readiness through attacks on weapons factories or logistics hubs</li><li><strong>Political destabilization</strong>: Amplifying socio-political divisions and instilling fear within local populations by creating a persistent threat of sabotage</li></ul><h3 id="legacy-of-soviet-era-sabotage-strategies">Legacy of Soviet-Era Sabotage Strategies</h3><p>Russian sabotage objectives today are largely consistent with Soviet-era strategies, as detailed by defector accounts and declassified documents. The Soviet Union frequently deployed covert operatives to weaken adversaries before and during conflicts. Today, Russian operatives continue to use cover identities, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2021-0909.pdf">recruit agents</a>, and employ rudimentary means (like arson or improvised explosives) to maintain plausible deniability. This continuity highlights the enduring influence of Soviet military doctrines in Russias current approach to hybrid warfare.</p><h3 id="mitigations">Mitigations</h3><p>To counter the growing threat of Russian sabotage, NATO and its member states should strengthen infrastructure security and improve intelligence-sharing mechanisms across borders. Key steps include:</p><ul><li>Use Recorded Future Intelligence Clouds <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/geopolitical-intelligence">Facility Risk</a> feature to monitor notable events occurring in close proximity to critical infrastructure facilities.</li><li>Use the <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform/intelligence-cloud">Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud</a> to track potential Russian sabotage events and monitor commonly used tactics.</li><li>Enhance national and local counterintelligence, surveillance, and physical security monitoring measures around critical infrastructure, such as those identified in previously documented Russian sabotage operations.</li><li>Increase cooperation and intelligence-sharing among European nations on Russian sabotage activities and collaborate on identifying transnational Russian agent networks.</li><li>Monitor for signs of escalating Russian hybrid activities, such as sudden upticks in unexplained accidents or environmental incidents, and communicate risks to relevant businesses and industries.</li></ul><h2 id="outlook">Outlook</h2><p>Russias sabotage activities are unlikely to wane as tensions with NATO continue. As hybrid warfare evolves, so too will Russian tactics, with an increased emphasis on leveraging emerging technologies and maintaining deniability. The stakes for European security are high; Russian sabotage has the potential to not only disrupt essential services but also create political instability and weaken public trust in governments ability to protect their citizens.</p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/ta-ru-2024-1114.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[China-based TAG-112 exploited Tibetan sites to spread Cobalt Strike malware. Recorded Future reveals targeted threats by state-sponsored actors.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png"></p><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>In a recent cyber campaign, the Chinese state-sponsored threat group TAG-112 compromised two Tibetan websites, Tibet Post and Gyudmed Tantric University, to deliver the Cobalt Strike malware. Recorded Futures Insikt Group discovered that the attackers embedded malicious JavaScript in these sites, which spoofed a TLS certificate error to trick visitors into downloading a disguised security certificate. This malware, often used by threat actors for remote access and post-exploitation, highlights a continued cyber-espionage focus on Tibetan entities. TAG-112s infrastructure, concealed using Cloudflare, links this campaign to other China-sponsored operations, particularly TAG-102 (Evasive Panda).</p><hr><h2 id="china-based-tag-112-compromises-tibetan-websites-to-distribute-cobalt-strike">China-Based TAG-112 Compromises Tibetan Websites to Distribute Cobalt Strike</h2><p>Cyberattacks targeting ethnic and religious minority groups in China continue, with new developments pointing to a targeted campaign against Tibetan organizations. In a recent investigation, Recorded Futures Insikt Group discovered a Chinese state-sponsored threat actor group, designated TAG-112, responsible for compromising Tibetan community websites and delivering Cobalt Strike, a potent cyber-espionage tool.</p><h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2><p>In late May 2024, TAG-112 compromised at least two Tibetan community websites: Tibet Post (tibetpost[.]net) and Gyudmed Tantric University (gyudmedtantricuniversity[.]org). The attackers exploited vulnerabilities in the Joomla content management system (CMS) used by these sites to implant malicious JavaScript. This JavaScript prompted visitors to download a fake security certificate, which, when opened, deployed the Cobalt Strike payload.</p><p>TAG-112s infrastructure shows notable overlap with TAG-102 (<a href="https://therecord.media/china-based-hackers-evasive-isps-malware">Evasive Panda</a>), a more sophisticated Chinese state-sponsored group known for targeting Tibetan entities. However, Insikt Group has identified TAG-112 as a separate entity due to differences in attack maturity and tactics, such as using Cobalt Strike rather than custom malware and foregoing JavaScript obfuscation.</p><h3 id="malicious-javascript-and-spoofed-tls-error">Malicious JavaScript and Spoofed TLS Error</h3><p>The attack begins with the malicious JavaScript embedded in the compromised websites. When a user visits one of these sites, the script detects the operating system and browser type, confirming compatibility with Windows. If compatible, the script initiates a connection with TAG-112s command-and-control (C2) domain, update[.]maskrisks[.]com, which then returns an HTML page spoofing a legitimate TLS certificate error.</p><p>This spoofed error page is crafted to mimic Google Chromes TLS certificate warning, deceiving users into clicking a link to &quot;download a security certificate.&quot; Upon clicking, users unknowingly initiate the download of <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/detect-cobalt-strike-inside-look">Cobalt Strike</a>, a legitimate tool commonly used by security testers but often exploited by attackers for remote access and command execution.</p><h3 id="exploiting-website-vulnerabilities">Exploiting Website Vulnerabilities</h3><p>TAG-112 likely gained access to the compromised Tibetan websites through vulnerabilities in Joomla, a popular CMS. Websites built on Joomla are frequently targeted by attackers if they are not adequately maintained and updated. Likely by exploiting these weaknesses, TAG-112 was able to upload the malicious JavaScript file, which remains active on these sites as of early October 2024.</p><h3 id="infrastructure-and-obfuscation-tactics">Infrastructure and Obfuscation Tactics</h3><p>TAG-112s infrastructure shows a level of sophistication in concealing its origins. The group used Cloudflare to shield its servers&#39; IP addresses, complicating efforts to trace the infrastructure back to its origin. Insikt Group identified multiple IP addresses linked to TAG-112s C2 servers, some active as early as March 2024. The primary domain, maskrisks[.]com, was registered in March 2024 through Namecheap, with subdomains such as mail[.]maskrisks[.]com and checkupdate[.]maskrisks[.]com added for further operational flexibility.</p><h3 id="tag-112s-use-of-cobalt-strike">TAG-112s Use of Cobalt Strike</h3><p>Cobalt Strike is a commercial penetration testing tool that has become a favorite among threat actors due to its versatility and powerful capabilities for remote access, lateral movement, and command-and-control. Insikt Group identified six distinct Cobalt Strike Beacon samples linked to TAG-112, with their C2 communication directed to mail[.]maskrisks[.]com. This malware enables TAG-112 to monitor and control compromised systems, gathering intelligence and potentially leveraging these infected systems for further espionage activities.</p><h3 id="connections-to-tag-102-evasive-panda">Connections to TAG-102 (Evasive Panda)</h3><p>TAG-112 shares several operational characteristics with TAG-102 (Evasive Panda), another <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/chinese-cyberespionage-operations">Chinese APT known for targeting the Tibetan community</a>. Both groups have used similar methods, including spoofed error pages to deliver malicious files. However, TAG-112s operations are less sophisticated than TAG-102, indicating that it may be a subgroup or less experienced branch. For instance, while TAG-102 has deployed customized malware and used obfuscation techniques, TAG-112 relies on the readily available Cobalt Strike tool without obfuscating its JavaScript.</p><p>Despite the lack of obfuscation, TAG-112s tactics and overlaps with TAG-102 highlight the Chinese governments ongoing interest in Tibetan and other ethnic and religious minority communities. Such campaigns are part of a broader strategy of surveillance and control, targeting groups perceived as threats to the stability and control of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).</p><h3 id="mitigation-recommendations">Mitigation Recommendations</h3><p>TAG-112s campaign underscores the importance of proactive cybersecurity measures, particularly for organizations that may be high-value targets for state-sponsored actors. Recorded Future recommends the following steps:</p><ol><li><strong>Intrusion Detection and Prevention</strong>: Configure intrusion detection (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to alert on any indicators of compromise (IoCs) associated with TAG-112. Consider blocking connections to known TAG-112 infrastructure after a thorough review.</li><li><strong>User Training</strong>: Educate users to exercise caution when handling files downloaded from untrusted sources. Advise users against opening files that download automatically without input, as these could be part of phishing or drive-by download attacks.</li><li><strong>Cobalt Strike Detection</strong>: Enable real-time monitoring for malicious Cobalt Strike C2 servers using threat intelligence modules such as Recorded Futures Intelligence Cloud.</li><li><strong>Network Monitoring</strong>: Regularly monitor network traffic for signs of compromise, particularly for connections to known threat infrastructure. Malicious Traffic Analysis (MTA) can help detect unusual activity, alerting security teams to potential C2 communications.</li></ol><h2 id="outlook">Outlook</h2><p>TAG-112s operations against Tibetan organizations reflect a longstanding objective within <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/charting-chinas-climb-leading-global-cyber-power">Chinese cyber-espionage</a> campaigns to monitor and control ethnic and religious minorities, especially those seen as potentially destabilizing. Other groups and regions with similar CCP-designated risk profiles are likely targets of similar state-sponsored attacks.</p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-cn-2024-1112.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p><h2>Appendix A  Indicators of Compromise</h2><table><tbody><tr><td style="font-family:Courier New;background-color:#ffffff;"><strong>Compromised Websites:</strong><br>tibetpost[.]net<br>gyudmedtantricuniversity[.]org<br><br><strong>C2 Domains:</strong><br>maskrisks[.]com<br>mail[.]maskrisks[.]com<br>update[.]maskrisks[.]com<br>checkupdate[.]maskrisks[.]com<br><br><br><strong>C2 IP Addresses:</strong><br>154.90.62[.]12<br>154.90.63[.]166<br>154.205.138[.]202<br><br><strong>Certificates:</strong><br>d0972247c500d2a45f412f9434287161de395a35ef5b4931cba12cf513b76962(*[.]dnspod[.]cn)<br>94569f64f62eff185ba47e991dba54bdeea6d1a9e205d6bec767be6a864e4efb (Cloudflare Origin *.maskrisks[.]com)<br>d4938cb5c031ec7f04d73d4e75f5db5c8a5c04ce (Stolen code-signing certificate KP MOBILE)<br><br><strong>URLs of malicious JavaScript:</strong><br>https[:]//gyudmedtantricuniversity[.]org/templates/lt_interiordesign/js/custom.js<br>https[:]//tibetpost[.]net/templates/ja_teline_v/js/gallery/jquery.blueimp-gallery.full.js<br><br><strong>Malicious URLs:</strong><br>https[:]//update[.]maskrisks[.]com/download <br>https[:]//update[.]maskrisks[.]com/?type=Chrome<br>https[:]//update[.]maskrisks[.]com/?type=Edge<br>http[:]//mail[.]maskrisks[.]com/api/view.php<br>http[:]//154.205.138[.]202/GetUrl/cache<br>https[:]//checkupdate[.]maskrisks[.]com/cache<br>https[:]//update[.]maskrisks[.]com/cache<br><br><strong>Cobalt Strike:</strong><br>1e42cbe23055e921eff46e5e6921ff1a20bb903fca83ea1f1294394c0df3f4cd<br>0e306c0836a8ee035ae739c5adfbe42bd5021e615ebaa92f52d5d86fb895651d<br>f1f11e52a60e5a446f1eb17bb718358def4825342acc0a41d09a051359a1eb3d<br>f4ded3a67480a0e2a822af1e87a727243dea16ac1a3c0513aec62bff71f06b27<br>966d311dcc598922e4ab9ce5524110a8bfd2c6b6db540d180829ceb7a7253831<br>1e7cb19f77206317c8828f9c3cdee76f2f0ebf7451a625641f7d22bb8c61b21b<br><br><strong>Loaders:</strong><br>8d4049ef70c83a6ead26736c1330e2783bdc9708c497183317fad66b818e44cb<br>E190c7e097a1c38dd45d9c149e737ad9253b1cabee1cee7ef080ddf52d1b378c (legitimate software)<br>31f11b4d81f3ae25b6a01cd1038914f31d045bc4136c40a6221944ea553d6414<br><br></td></tr></tbody></table>            <p><br><br></p><h2>Appendix B  Mitre ATT&CK Techniques</h2><table style="background-color:#ffffff;"><tr><td style="background-color:#0071CE;color:#ffffff;font-weight: 700;"><strong>Tactic: Technique</strong></td><td style="background-color:#0071CE;color:#ffffff;font-weight: 700;"><strong>ATT&CK Code</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Resource Development:</strong> Acquire Infrastructure: Server</td><td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/004/" rel="nofollow noopener">T1583.004</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Resource Development:</strong> Acquire Infrastructure: Web Services</td><td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/006/" rel="nofollow noopener">T1583.006</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Resource Development:</strong> Compromise Infrastructure: Server</td><td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584/004/" rel="nofollow noopener">T1584.004</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Initial Access:</strong> Drive-by Compromise</td><td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189/" rel="nofollow noopener">T1189</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Defense Evasion:</strong> Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Side-Loading</td><td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002/" rel="nofollow noopener">T1574.002</a></td></tr></table>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Increasingly, attackers don&#39;t hack in anymorethey log in. As enterprises rapidly adopt cloud-based SaaS applications, our security landscape has fundamentally shifted. Identity, not infrastructure, has become the primary target.</p><h2 id="why-identity-is-the-new-battlefield">Why Identity Is the New Battlefield</h2><p>To understand the scale of this identity crisis, let&#39;s look at the data:</p><ul><li>In 2024, credential-based attacks remain the leading cause of data breaches, responsible for <a href="https://blog.1password.com/verizon-data-breach-report-2024-analysis/#:~:text=in%202024%2C%20the%20overwhelming%20majority%20of%20data%20breaches%20can%20still%20be%20traced%20to%20credential%2Dbased%20attacks%20and%20human%20error.">~38% of incidents</a>, significantly outpacing phishing (~17%) and exploits (~16%). While <a href="https://news.trendmicro.com/2024/07/22/phishing-stats-2024/#:~:text=An%20astonishing%2070%25%20of%20phishing%20attacks%20aim%20for%20credential%20theft.%20Cybercriminals%20seek%20unauthorized%20access%20to%20corporate%20networks%20and%20sensitive%20data%2C%20emphasizing%20the%20importance%20of%20robust%20authentication%20mechanisms.">phishing</a> is often reported separately, it primarily serves as a vehicle to steal credentials. </li><li>Once attackers obtain credentials, they target web applications (<a href="https://delinea.com/blog/2024-verizon-dbir-credential-compromise-dominates#:~:text=%E2%80%9CCredentials%20carries%20a,level%20of%20security.">~50% of cases</a>) rather than VPNs or remote desktop solutions. This is a problem because cloud-based apps often have limited security visibility, a growing risk as organizations now use an average of <a href="https://backlinko.com/saas-statistics#:~:text=Organizations%20now%20use%20an%20average%20of%20112%20SaaS%20applications%2C%20up%20from%2016%20in%202017">112 SaaS appsup from just 16 in 2017</a>.</li><li><a href="https://blog.1password.com/verizon-data-breach-report-2024-analysis/#:~:text=use%20of%20stolen%20credentials%E2%80%9D%20is%20the%20number%20one%20initial%20action%20during%20breaches%2C%20and%20stolen%20credentials%20also%20account%20for%20a%20whopping%2077%25%20of%20Basic%20Web%20Application%20Attacks">77%</a> of SaaS application attacks (a subset of web app attacks) begin with stolen credentials.</li></ul><p>This focus on identity-based attacks is amplified by two emerging trends:</p><ol><li>The Rise of Shadow Identities: Employee-driven SaaS adoption has outpaced IT oversight, resulting in unmonitored accounts across organizations.

When employees sign up with basic credentials before IT can establish proper identity management, it can create a dangerous scenario called &quot;<a href="https://github.com/pushsecurity/saas-attacks/blob/main/techniques/ghost_logins/description.md">Ghost Login</a>&quot;where accounts become susceptible to takeover through dual authentication paths.</li></ol><h2 id="the-snowflake-incident-a-warning-sign">The Snowflake Incident: A Warning Sign</h2><p>To understand how these identity vulnerabilities play out in real-world scenarios, we can look at the recent <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/unc5537-snowflake-data-theft-extortion">incident</a> involving a cloud software provider. This incident, which led to millions of records in data exposure for 165 organizations, exposed a dangerous intersection of vulnerabilities that could threaten many SaaS platforms. The attackers exploited three critical weaknesses that exist across today&#39;s SaaS landscape, one of which aligns with Ghost Logins:</p><ul><li>Compromised credentials<a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/unc5537-snowflake-data-theft-extortion#:~:text=Mandiant%20identified%20that%20the%20majority%20of%20the%20credentials%20used%20by%20UNC5537%20were%20available%20from%20historical%20infostealer%20infections%2C%20some%20of%20which%20dated%20as%20far%20back%20as%202020.">some dating back to breaches from 2020</a>.</li><li>Weak or absent MFA: Some victims were susceptible to Ghost Login attacks due to the availability of multiple authentication avenues. </li><li>Widespread application adoption.</li></ul><p>This recipe for compromise is particularly troubling because these three elements are present in so many SaaS applications today.

            <description><![CDATA[Explore Russiaâs strategic information attack (SIA) concept, blending psychological and cyber tactics to target critical infrastructure in large-scale warfare.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png"></p><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>Russias Strategic Information Attack (SIA) concept focuses on non-kinetic methods to disrupt or destroy adversary national critical infrastructure (NCI) during strategic conflicts. Insikt Group acknowledges that SIA is not an official term used in Russian or Western defense parlance. Based on Russian doctrine, SIAs target adversaries through &quot;psychological attacks&quot; (influence operations) and &quot;technical attacks&quot; (cyberattacks) to exact strategic damage. While SIA is almost certainly reserved for large-scale war scenarios, it shares similarities with lower-intensity cyber and information attacks already observed in Western countries, such as targets. The goal of SIA is to employ strategic non-kinetic capabilities to escalate the conflict and force adversaries into negotiations on Moscows terms by causing significant infrastructure disruptions  aligned with Russias escalate to de-escalate conflict escalation management strategy. </p><h2 id="russian-strategic-information-attack-for-catastrophic-effect">Russian Strategic Information Attack for Catastrophic Effect</h2><p>Non-kinetic warfare is emerging and evolving as a significant threat. One such tool in Russias arsenal is the SIA, a concept that blends psychological and technical tactics to disrupt and destabilize adversaries&#39; NCI. This Insikt Group report dives into the mechanics of Russias SIA, the strategy, doctrine, and policies that frame it, its potential targets, and why Western organizations must be vigilant.</p><h3 id="the-concept-of-sia">The Concept of SIA</h3><p>Russias SIA concept involves employing non-kinetic methods, such as psychological attacks (influence operations) and technical attacks (cyberattacks), to damage or destroy NCI. This tactic is anchored, in concept, to Russias perception of how the United States historically used nuclear weapons in WWII to escalate the use of military means to compel its adversary to accept peace negotiations (de-escalation). The primary goal is to exact catastrophic damage to the adversary and weaken the enemys ability to sustain conflict, leading to negotiations that favor Russias terms.</p><p>In Russian doctrine, SIAs are framed by the Kremlins information confrontation strategy, which includes efforts to <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/russia-linked-copycop-uses-llms-to-weaponize-influence-content-at-scale">manipulate information systems</a> and the publics perception. These attacks aim to undermine the target countrys political stability and NCI. Russia&#39;s view on information warfare treats cyberspace as both a battleground and a domain for strategic advantage.</p><h3 id="psychological-attacks-in-sia">Psychological Attacks in SIA</h3><p>Psychological attacks focus on shaping adversaries&#39; perceptions and eroding trust in their leadership and institutions. By disseminating true and false information or exploiting existing societal tensions, Russia seeks to create widespread chaos and unrest. In times of heightened conflict, these attacks can drive public panic, leading to political instability. For instance, Russian defense analysts propose the malicious use of artificial intelligence (MUAI) could lead to <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/deepfakes-id-verification">deepfake videos</a> impersonating key leaders, further exacerbating societal concerns or divisions.</p><p>Historically, Russia has demonstrated expertise in influence operations. Soviet-era active measures aimed at <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/russian-information-operations-divide-western-coalition-ukraine">destabilizing Western countries</a> are now updated with modern techniques, including the use of AI-generated content. Russian military theorists have outlined scenarios in which information could cause societal collapse, with analysts predicting that such tactics could be used to provoke a second Civil War in the United States.</p><h3 id="technical-attacks-in-sia">Technical Attacks in SIA</h3><p>On the technical side, SIA encompasses sophisticated cyberattacks designed to disrupt or destroy NCI. These attacks could target communication systems, power grids, financial infrastructure, or government networks. In contrast to typical cyberattacks, which might cause short-term damage, strategic cyberattacks aim for long-lasting, widespread effects.</p><p>During <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/themes-failures-russias-war-against-ukraine">Russias war in Ukraine</a>  which is not characterized as a large-scale war in Russias official military doctrine , <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/dark-covenant-2-cybercrime-russian-state-war-ukraine">cyberattacks were a major component of the Kremlins strategy</a>. However, these attacks were focused on specific tactical objectives, rather than full-scale strategic destruction. If Russia were to initiate an SIA during a large-scale war, it would almost certainly be aimed at critical infrastructure that directly supports both civilian and military operations, causing significant damage and forcing the adversary to acquiesce to Moscows demands.</p><h3 id="strategic-targets-soviet-era-and-modern-targeting-methodologies">Strategic Targets: Soviet-era and Modern Targeting Methodologies</h3><p>To frame Russian SIA, Insikt Group cited Soviet-era and modern Russian targeting concepts. Defector Viktor Suvorov revealed a model that divided critical infrastructure into categories such as the brain (national leadership), nervous system (national communications), heart and blood supply (national energy infrastructure), and teeth (nuclear weapons capabilities). While this model primarily applied to kinetic operations, it aligns with Russias modern cyber capabilities, where attacks could focus on these same vital systems.</p><p>Russias doctrine of escalate to de-escalate refers to the use of efforts to force an adversary to negotiate. This strategy is typically associated with Russias nuclear arsenal but applies equally to strategic cyber capabilities. By launching an SIA against NCI, Russia seeks to create enough pressure on adversary governments to achieve its geopolitical objectives without resorting to strategic kinetic means  such as mass conventional or nuclear weapons strikes.</p><p>Russias modern military doctrine, Strategic Operations for the Destruction of Critically Important Targets (SODCIT), outlines a similar approach for targeting NCI in a way that limits civilian casualties while exerting pressure on national governments. The intent is to force adversaries into negotiations by threatening critical infrastructure without causing mass casualties.</p><p>The dual approach of psychological and technical attacks allows Russia to customize its targeting. In some cases, <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/russian-and-iranian-influence-networks-target-french-elections">psychological attacks alonesuch as influence operations</a>are intended to erode trust and create enough chaos to disrupt governance. In other cases, technical attacks target an adversarys ability to communicate or distribute power. Psychological and technical attacks can also have overlapping effects, such as influence operations that undermine faith and confidence in the financial sector that coincide with technical attacks against financial networks. </p><h3 id="outlook">Outlook</h3><p>Western countries, particularly those managing critical infrastructure, must prepare for potential Russian SIAs. The risks posed by these attacks are substantial, but public and private entities can take steps to mitigate them. </p><p>Organizations need to improve cybersecurity defenses, including monitoring for signs of psychological attacks. Collaboration between governments, private enterprises, and cybersecurity experts will be crucial in identifying and mitigating these threats. Exercises and simulations, such as red teaming, can help organizations test their readiness for potential attacks. Industry leaders must consider incorporating scenarios that mirror Russias SIAs to strengthen defenses and identify vulnerabilities.</p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/ta-ru-2024-1024.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png"></p><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>Operation Overload, a Russia-aligned influence operation, is aggressively targeting the 2024 US presidential election. Using fake news, fact-checking sites, and AI-generated audio, it seeks to manipulate public opinion by impersonating trusted media organizations. This campaign primarily targets media outlets, fact-checkers, and researchers, aiming to overwhelm investigative resources and insert false narratives into mainstream discourse, but also directly targets the general public. Operation Overload previously attempted to <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/russian-and-iranian-influence-networks-target-french-elections">undermine the 2024 French elections</a> and the <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/hurdling-over-hazards-multifaceted-threats-to-the-2024-paris-olympics">Paris Olympics</a>, although with minimal success. Its goal now is to undermine trust in the US election process, exploit divisive social issues, stoke fears of political violence, and target candidates, particularly Vice President Kamala Harris.</p><h2 id="operation-overload-impersonates-media-to-influence-us-election">Operation Overload Impersonates Media to Influence US Election</h2><p>Operation Overload, also known as Matryoshka and Storm-1679, is a sophisticated Russia-aligned influence campaign designed to manipulate public opinion and sow discord. Previously attempting to undermine the 2024 French elections and the Paris Olympics, the operation is now shifting its focus to the 2024 US presidential election. It involves creating fake news sites, false fact-checking resources, and AI-generated audio that mimics legitimate media outlets. By impersonating trusted news organizations, the operation seeks to establish credibility to influence its targets more effectively.</p><h3 id="key-tactics-and-techniques">Key Tactics and Techniques</h3><ol><li><strong>Impersonation of Trusted Media Brands:</strong> Operation Overload relies heavily on impersonating reputable news outlets to lend credibility to its influence operations. By copying logos, using similar fonts and layouts, and falsely attributing content to real journalists, <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/russia-linked-copycop-uses-llms-to-weaponize-influence-content-at-scale">it creates content that appears legitimate</a>. This includes recycling video and image materials from publicly available sources and generating professional-sounding AI-generated voiceovers.</li><li><strong>AI-Generated Content:</strong> One of the newer developments in Operation Overload&#39;s toolkit is the use of AI to generate realistic voiceovers. This content, often used in short videos, further amplifies its perceived credibility and makes it more challenging to differentiate between legitimate and fake information.</li><li><strong>Targeting of Media and Fact-Checking Organizations:</strong> Operation Overload directs much of its focus toward media organizations, fact-checkers, and researchers. By flooding them with spam-like requests and fake fact-checking leads, the operation seeks to overwhelm their resources. This makes it harder for them to debunk Russian disinformation and risks them inadvertently reporting on false content, thereby injecting Russian malign narratives into mainstream political discourse.</li><li><strong>Amplification Through Automated Social Media:</strong> The operation also utilizes automated bots to spread its influence content on social media. This tactic, referred to as coordinated inauthentic behavior (CIB), helps amplify false narratives on social media platforms, making the content more widespread and visible to the general public.</li></ol><h3 id="the-role-of-ai-in-operation-overload">The Role of AI in Operation Overload</h3><p>One of the newer developments of Operation Overload is its reliance on AI-generated audio. <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/adversarial-intelligence-red-teaming-malicious-use-cases-ai">AI is being used to create voiceovers and make fake media content</a> appear to be from legitimate media outlets. This allows for the rapid production of high-quality disinformation at scale, making it more challenging to detect and debunk.</p><h3 id="impacts-on-the-2024-us-election">Impacts on the 2024 US Election</h3><p>The operation&#39;s primary goal is to overwhelm journalists and fact-checkers with persistent, spam-like requests to verify the operations inauthentic content, diverting resources from pursuing legitimate investigations and debunking Russian disinformation. The operation also hopes to use media organizations as a means of information laundering, more specifically, to inject malign content and pro-Kremlin narratives into mainstream political discourse via trusted parties. Finally, the operation seeks to directly inject influence content into mainstream discussion of contentious political issues, eroding public trust in the democratic process, provoking US domestic concerns of political violence and civil war, and exploiting existing social divisions.</p><p>Some of the narratives pushed by Operation Overload include:</p><ul><li><strong>Stoking Fears of Political Violence:</strong> By amplifying concerns about civil unrest and even civil war, the operation seeks to provoke fear and uncertainty.</li><li><strong>Targeting Candidates:</strong> Vice President Harris, in particular, is a major target of the operation&#39;s disinformation efforts. Content falsely links her to a wide range of scandals, aiming to damage her reputation ahead of the election.</li><li><strong>Vilifying Ukrainians and the LGBTQIA+ Community:</strong> The operation provokes negative sentiment toward these communities to decrease public support for Ukraine and exploit social divisions in the US, respectively.</li></ul><h3 id="mitigations">Mitigations</h3><p>Mitigating the potential effects of Operation Overload requires a coordinated effort between media organizations, fact-checkers, researchers, and policymakers. Here are key steps that can be taken:</p><ol><li><strong>Monitoring Social Media Channels:</strong> Potentially targeted organizations should regularly monitor Telegram and social media channels identified in this report as promoting Operation Overload content, using appropriate operational security measures.</li><li><strong>Strengthening Fact-Checking Protocols:</strong> Media organizations should strengthen verification processes and source authentication measures where possible to prevent the unintentional spread of Operation Overload content. </li><li><strong>Information Sharing:</strong> These organizations should also enhance information-sharing and coordination with their peers and the broader counter-influence community to decrease the likelihood of publishing a false fact-checking lead or inadvertently overexerting resources to pursue a deceptive lead.</li><li><strong>Public Awareness and Media Literacy:</strong> Public education about how influence operations work is crucial. The general public needs to be aware of how to identify false information and be more discerning about the sources it trusts.</li><li><strong>Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud:</strong> Media entities, researchers, and public sector organizations can use the <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform/intelligence-cloud">Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud</a> to track research developments and other analyses of <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/malign-influence-threats-mount-ahead-us-2024-elections">Operation Overloads emerging narratives ahead of the 2024 US election</a> and its continued activities in Europe. Defenders can also use the Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud to monitor developments in previously documented and emerging influence operations from nation-state adversaries.</li><li><strong>Recorded Future Brand Intelligence:</strong> Media organizations can use <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/brand-intelligence">Recorded Future Brand Intelligence</a> to track and combat brand abuse, including attempted typosquatting and logo impersonation.</li></ol><h2 id="outlook">Outlook</h2><p>As the 2024 US election draws nearer, Operation Overload is very likely to ramp up its activities. The operation&#39;s administrators are expected to impersonate more media outlets and expand their reach. We expect Operation Overload to continue attempting to fuel polarization in the US by pushing narratives that deepen existing divisions on controversial issues and discredit key political figures like Vice President Harris and, to a much lesser extent, former President Donald Trump. </p><p>As Insikt Group continues to track growing concerns regarding election security and integrity, Operation Overload will likely amplify conspiracy theories around voter fraud and rigged elections, posing as legitimate media, to undermine confidence in the democratic process. </p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/ta-ru-2024-1023.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[How Complexity Influences Security Outcomes in a Volatile World]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Editor&#39;s note: The following blog post originally appeared on <a href="https://intelligence2risk.substack.com/">Levi Gundert&#39;s Substack page</a>.</strong></em></p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/0236694f_85c8_4620_992b_87418c1e77af_1024x1024_50f79706bb.webp" alt="0236694f-85c8-4620-992b-87418c1e77af_1024x1024.webp"></p><p>Riz was <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/12/04/1216950808/rizz-oxford-word-of-the-year-swiftie">Oxfords 2023 word</a> of the year. For the uninitiated, riz roughly translates to charisma (if you have a young teenager at home, ask them for a definition of rizzler and enjoy the confused expression resulting from your breach of their world). However, in business, we should co-opt riz as shorthand for resilience, particularly for those in the security industry. Riz represents the ability to withstand attacks, minimize damage, and quickly recover, ensuring business continuity. In security, riz requires consuming intelligence, inspecting existing controls, and addressing identified gaps (where appropriate). </p><p>Complexity and resilience have a nuanced relationship  resilience often increases with complexity up to a point, but too much complexity erodes riz, making systems fragile and harder to defend. While simple solutions (following the <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/kiss-keep-it-simple-stupid-a-design-principle">KISS principle</a>) can lead to resilience, maximum resilience in security often lies somewhere in the middle of the complexity spectrum. </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/b5e9aedd_f725_4f5f_863c_5c6b87570a09_1432x854_1abe88dfa0.webp" alt="b5e9aedd-f725-4f5f-863c-5c6b87570a09_1432x854.webp"></p><p><em>This chart and subsequent charts were quickly produced by <a href="https://hex.tech/">hex.tech</a> using Python code generated from ChatGPT.</em></p><h2 id="real-world-examples-complexity-and-resilience-in-action">Real-World Examples: Complexity and Resilience in Action</h2><p>Two semi-recent events -  a global IT outage (low complexity) and an attempted assassination (high complexity) - offer an opportunity to dissect how these two themes - complexity and resilience - influence risk management and how we should assess solutions that maximize resilience. The challenge is riz measurement and how security professionals can have confidence that they have comprehensively reviewed risk scenarios. The <a href="https://youtu.be/XaoigWHOtBM?feature=shared">Cone of Plausibility</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/GFVKKTwkANY?feature=shared">PESTLE</a> are intelligence frameworks that provide scaffolding for scenario exploration, and help assess how complexity impacts resilience in different contexts.</p><p><strong>[1] Global IT Outages: Low-Complexity Scenarios</strong></p><p>When a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24201803/crowdstrike-microsoft-it-global-outage-airlines-banking">faulty EDR update triggered significant Windows malfunctions</a>, the pain was immediately felt, and the social media armchair pundits were quick to throw stones. However, these errors can happen anywhere; thats the frailty of human brains mixed with complex technology systems. </p><p>Instead of analyzing fault, smart organizations looked for new learnings. Of course, resilience against future scenarios was at the top of the conversation list. Its natural to consider expanding beyond a single point of failure (or vendor) for any function, security, or otherwise, but this is where scenarios and associated costs are helpful. </p><p>Recorded Futures CIO - Josh Jones - estimates that running multiple EDR products for a company of 1,000 employees likely creates somewhere in the ballpark of 15% more overhead - software maintenance, updates, knowledge bases, etc. For a large enterprise with 100K endpoints, 30% additional resources are likely required to maintain multiple EDR products across different segments of the endpoint population. Then, there are decisions about which business units (or which percentage of business units) should run a different EDR client. </p><p>The chart below approximates where a single EDR vendor scores in simplicity. The same concept could apply to any segment of a computing stack. The theory is that additional diversity in vendor relationships could partially mitigate a similar future operating system outage. Naturally, additional resilience may also result in greater complexity. </p><p>In security, organizations can measure resilience by recognizing solution complexity as an essential cost before investing resources. </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/3639d7c3_d5bd_48c6_ba73_5b178d1ad2ed_1382x822_142aacaa94.webp" alt="3639d7c3-d5bd-48c6-ba73-5b178d1ad2ed_1382x822.webp"></p><p><em>A visual approximation of an operational technology scenario with low complexity and resilience.</em></p><p><strong>[2] U.S. Secret Service (USSS) Physical Protection: High-Complexity Scenarios</strong></p><p>When the news of the failed assassination attempt of former President Trump (and the deaths of innocent bystanders) started lighting up peoples phones, friends and family were quick to text me, asking for an explanation related to how such a scenario was possible. </p><p>Drawing from my experience as a former U.S. Secret Service (USSS) Agent, I can provide some small insights into the complexity of protective operations. The USSS is a dual-mission agency, responsible for both protection and investigations. This dual mandate and limited resources create a complex operational environment. A comparison of <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2022-03/U.S.%20Secret%20Service_Remediated.pdf">USSS funding</a> and <a href="https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-03/fbi_fy_24_pb_bud_sum_ii_omb_cleared_3-08-23.pdf">FBI funding</a> highlights a significant resource gap (for context, USSS <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classification-qualifications/general-schedule-qualification-standards/1800/criminal-investigation-series-1811/">special agents</a> total ~4k compared to FBI special agents, who number ~14k). </p><p>Limited resources become detrimental given the demands of criminal investigations (e.g., <a href="https://www.secretservice.gov/newsroom/releases/2023/05/secret-service-state-department-offer-10-million-dollar-reward">fraud and cybercrime</a>), added to continuous protection mandates (<a href="https://www.britannica.com/list/secret-service-code-names-of-11-us-presidents">POTUS</a>, <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/272109285312">VPOTUS</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Former_Presidents_Act">former POTUSes</a>, <a href="https://www.etsy.com/ca/listing/1205067395/usss-dpd-us-secret-service-dignitary">visiting foreign dignitaries</a>, <a href="https://www.secretservice.gov/protection/events">national events</a>, etc.), which require significant capital and human assets. The USSS is successful in its mission because it excels at planning and logistics. The last resort, bodyguarding, generally only occurs due to suboptimal riz. Unlike digital systems downtime, which we <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/business/crowdstrike-microsoft-outage-corporate-workers.html">generally accept</a> happens, the risk tolerance for an adverse event in a protective mission is roughly zero. </p><p>This is where former POTUS Trumps Pennsylvania rally becomes relevant. To address agent staffing demands, the USSS regularly partners with local, state, and federal law enforcement to protect outer perimeters during events. In addition to boosting numbers, these partnerships bring additional expertise, such as in-depth knowledge of the local environment, high-risk tactical units (SWAT), canine handlers, <a href="https://www.clevelandtn.gov/275/SWAT-Explosive-Ordinance-Disposal-EOD-Tr">EOD experts</a>, etc., that benefit the protective mission. However, coordinating technology (e.g., communications) is one area where complexity becomes challenging. </p><p>A command post often has to relay communications between agencies that may use different equipment, encryption protocols, etc. This dynamic creates delays and, at the risk of speculation, may have contributed to the hesitation of USSS sniper teams attempting to assess the nature of a suspect on a roof where other agencies were actively working. </p><p>While USSS advance agents (for both trips and individual sites) are incredibly detail-oriented, even the pre-event briefings with combined agencies can create confusion, as there are different standard operating procedures (e.g., rules of engagement, arresting authority, etc.). The physical security environment becomes inherently more complex as additional agencies and departments are added to the mix. Too much complexity reduces riz. </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/b6099c50_702a_4452_a7f5_867ec18704e9_1410x840_7ec682f82b.webp" alt="b6099c50-702a-4452-a7f5-867ec18704e9_1410x840.webp"></p><p><em>A visual approximation of a physical security scenario with high complexity and lower resilience.</em></p><h2 id="using-the-tools-cone-of-plausibility-and-pestle">Using the Tools: Cone of Plausibility and PESTLE</h2><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/14152740_2a6f_435e_8fc5_df607f23c4f5_1024x1024_cbd553c302.webp" alt="14152740-2a6f-435e-8fc5-df607f23c4f5_1024x1024.webp"></p><p>Mental scaffolding helps create confidence in evaluating potential outcomesroutine events and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blackswan.asp">black swans</a>to ultimately assess trade-offs in complexity and resilience. In security, resilience cannot be measured solely by internal metrics. As complexity grows, so too does the need for structured thinking. This is where the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016328722000957">Cone of Plausibility</a> and <a href="https://www.lawcareers.net/Explore/LCNSays/Wrestle-with-PESTLE-cybersecurity-threats-in-the-digital-age">PESTLE</a> excel as frameworks, helping professionals make informed decisions that ultimately safeguard business continuity. </p><p>PESTLE (Political, Economic, Sociological, Technological, Legal, and Environmental) helps broaden the scope of analysis, ensuring that organizations dont just focus on internal factors but also account for the broader context that influences resilience.</p><p>The Cone of Plausibility is used to assess a range of future scenarios by staging different possible outcomes. <a href="https://www.secalliance.com/blog/applying-cone-of-plausibility-to-cti">SecAlliance has a helpful write-up</a> (with examples) on how PESTLE-M (+Military) feeds the cone in cyber threat intelligence (CTI). </p><p>The scenario designations wildcard, plausible, and baseline are helpful labels that decision-makers can consistently anticipate. Additionally, these scenarios lack conclusions, thus avoiding leading the witness and allowing consumers to formulate their own derivative risk implications.  </p><p>Western business implications from accelerating geopolitical tensions with China present an interesting cone exercise (twenty-year time horizon). Specifically, the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/08/american-water-largest-us-water-utility-cyberattack.html">cyber scenarios</a> involve potential solutions with significant trade-offs in complexity and resilience. </p><h2 id="risk-management">Risk Management</h2><p>There are no right answers in complexity/resilience trade-offs. Organizations need better processes to evaluate equities and soberly manage risks. Sometimes, the riz juice isnt worth the squeeze, but everyone should understand the choices. </p><p><em>A special thank you to Rosie Hampton, Dylan Davis, and Megan Keeling for a lovely walk and discussion of these topics.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

This group has been active since January 2023 and has continuously evolved its tactics. Leveraging CleanUpLoader for post-exploitation, Rhysida has been observed crawling into systems, with the ultimate objective of causing significant damage.</p><p>In this detailed analysis, we will delve into how Rhysida uses its multi-tiered infrastructure and CleanUpLoader to execute ransomware attacks and how Recorded Futures Network Intelligence has proven crucial in early detection.</p><h3 id="rhysidas-attack-strategy">Rhysidas Attack Strategy</h3><p>Like many modern ransomware groups, Rhysida uses a multi-tiered infrastructure to carry out its attacks. Insikt Groups latest analysis, supported by Recorded Futures Network Intelligence, reveals how Rhysida uses its infrastructure to execute the early phases of the attack.</p><p>By creating typosquatted domains resembling popular software download sites, Rhysida tricks users into downloading infected files. This technique is particularly effective when coupled with SEO poisoning, in which these domains are ranked higher in search engine results, making them appear as legitimate download sources. Once a user clicks on one of these malicious domains, they are redirected to a payload server hosting CleanUpLoader, which is then used by the attacker during the post-exploitation phase. </p><h3 id="cleanuploader">CleanUpLoader</h3><p>CleanUpLoader is a versatile backdoor malware used by Rhysida in its attack campaigns. This malware was primarily seen delivered as fake installers for popular software, such as Microsoft Teams and Google Chrome, making it more likely that targets unknowingly install it. CleanUpLoader not only facilitates persistence but also enables Rhysida actors to exfiltrate valuable data before ransomware deployment.</p><p>With multiple C2 domains built into its configuration, CleanUpLoader ensures redundancy, allowing it to maintain operations even if one C2 server is taken offline. The backdoor communicates with its command-and-control (C2) servers via HTTPS.</p><h3 id="rhysidas-victim-profile">Rhysidas Victim Profile</h3><p>Rhysidas ransomware operations are global and affect a wide range of sectors, with the government and public sector being prime targets. These sectors have been particularly vulnerable due to their highly sensitive data and often insufficient security measures.</p><p>High-profile breaches include the attack on King Edward VIIs Hospital in London in 2023, where Rhysida claimed to have stolen sensitive information from hospital staff and patients, including members of the British royal family. Additionally, attacks on the Chilean Army and the City of Columbus demonstrate Rhysidas ability to infiltrate critical public sector infrastructures.</p><p>One of the group&#39;s distinguishing traits is its willingness to attack sectors that were previously off-limits for ransomware groups, including schools and hospitals. This represents a significant shift in ransomware ethics, signaling a more ruthless approach from modern threat actors.</p><h3 id="recorded-futures-early-detection">Recorded Futures Early Detection</h3><p>Recorded Futures Network Intelligence&#39;s early detection capabilities have proven to be a game-changer in combating ransomware. Insikt Group identified that Rhysida victims could be detected on average 30 days before appearing on public extortion sites. Monitoring Rhysidas infrastructure, including typosquatting domains and CleanUpLoader C2 servers, made this detection possible.</p><p>The average dwell time between initial infection and ransomware deployment offers defenders a critical window to respond. By identifying network communications and otherindicators of compromise (IoCs) early, security teams can act swiftly to neutralize threats before the attackers can encrypt data or issue ransom demands.</p><h3 id="proactive-defense-key-takeaways">Proactive Defense: Key Takeaways</h3><p>Given the sophistication of Rhysidas operations, defending against such ransomware requires a proactive and intelligence-driven approach. Recorded Future&#39;s Network Intelligence offers visibility into ransomware groups infrastructure, providing defenders with crucial insights into their tools, tactics, and procedures.</p><h3 id="here-are-key-defensive-strategies-against-rhysida">Here are key defensive strategies against Rhysida:</h3><p>Advanced threat detection: Use early indicators of compromise and detection rules for custom file scanning and detection in logs to identify and respond to threats.</p><p>Network Intelligence: Leverage Recorded Future Network Intelligence for early exfiltration detection, preventing ransomware escalation, using proactive infrastructure discovery by Insikt Group and extensive network traffic analysis.</p><p>User Training: Educate employees around malicious downloads, as these remain primary methods of infection.Patch Management: Ensure all systems are updated with the latest security patches to prevent exploits of known vulnerabilities.</p><p>Backups: Regularly back up critical data and ensure those backups are stored securely, preferably offline, to mitigate the impact of ransomware.</p><h3 id="outlook">Outlook</h3><p>Rhysida ransomware presents a significant threat across industries, with its use of CleanUpLoader making its operations highly effective and difficult to detect. However, with early detection methods such as those provided by Recorded Futures Network Intelligence, security teams can gain a crucial advantage, identifying victims well before ransomware deployment.</p><p>As ransomware threats continue to evolve, proactive monitoring of adversary infrastructure and the use of comprehensive intelligence solutions are essential in protecting organizations from devastating attacks.

            <description><![CDATA[Learn how DORA enhances operational resilience for financial institutions in the EU, focusing on ICT risk management, third-party oversight, and more.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Globally, regulations and directives are significantly altering the way organizations address cyber resilience, emphasizing the necessity for a more proactive stance. This is evident in both the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) and the second version of the Network and Information Systems Directive (NIS2).</p><h2 id="what-is-dora">What is DORA?</h2><p>DORA <a href="https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/digital-operational-resilience-act-dora_en">establishes</a> technical standards for EU member states to adopt as it relates to covered entities and their critical third-party Information &amp; Communications Technology (ICT) providers across EU member states. ICT is considered to be so influential and essential to economic development and business growth that it has been credited with ushering in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. However, this reliance on ICT means that organizations must focus on digital resilience to minimize risk of not being able to deliver critical and important services. </p><h2 id="who-does-dora-apply-to">Who Does DORA Apply To?</h2><p>The measures detailed by DORA will be applicable to both traditional and non-traditional financial entities operating in the EU and their ICT providers. ICT is broad and covers tools like cloud computing, software, hardware, transactions, communications, data, internet access, and more. </p><h2 id="why-is-dora-being-implemented">Why is DORA Being Implemented?</h2><p>The increasing reliance on digital technologies in the financial sector has been heard loud and clear - thus DORA was proposed. DORA aims to make sure that financial institutions can withstand, respond to, and recover from ICT-related disruptions and threats. Ultimately the Act aims to elevate the operational resilience of financial entities, safeguard financial stability, and protect consumers from the adverse impacts of digital disruptions. </p><h2 id="impact-of-cyber-attacks-on-financial-sector">Impact of Cyber Attacks on Financial Sector</h2><p>The financial sector saw a dramatic increase in Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, with a 154% rise from 2022 to 2023. In EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) the financial services sector accounted for 66% of all DDoS attacks, compared with 28% in North America. This surge in DDoS attacks against EMEA financial services institutions is likely due to geopolitical tensions and hacktivist activities related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, making the financial sector the most targeted by these types of attacks. (<a href="https://www.fsisac.com/newsroom/pr-akamai-ddos-report-2024">FS ISAC</a>) </p><p>Though not specifically against the Financial Sector, the MOVEit transfer attack highlights the impact of ICT. In 2023, a ransomware group named CL0P exploited a zero-day vulnerability in MOVEit, a managed file transfer software. This attack affected multiple organizations, including financial institutions and healthcare providers. CL0Ps <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/2023-annual-report">MOVEit campaign</a> garnered upwards of $100M in profit for the group, impacting over 2,750 organizations and 94 million individuals. It highlights the far-reaching impact software supply chain attacks can have.</p><h2 id="pillars-of-dora">Pillars of DORA</h2><ul><li><strong>ICT Risk Management and Governance:</strong> DORA will seek to mandate that the managing body of an organization holds ultimate responsibility for overseeing ICT risk. It emphasizes the need for a well-documented ICT risk management framework to swiftly, efficiently, and comprehensively tackle both cyber and physical risks. </li><li><strong>Incident Response and Reporting:</strong> Organizations will be required to maintain documented systems for monitoring, managing, logging, classifying, and reporting ICT-related incidents. This ensures prompt and effective responses to any issues that arise. </li><li><strong>Digital Operational Resilience Testing:</strong> Financial institutions under DORA must regularly test their defenses and identify any vulnerabilities in their ICT systems. This proactive approach helps maintain robust protections against potential threats. </li><li><strong>Third-Party Risk Management:</strong> DORA seeks to impose  requirements not only for financial institutions, but also for their ICT providers. Critical ICT third-party service providers are often subject to oversight from relevant managing bodies. Financial firms should actively manage ICT third-party risks through contractual agreements and diligent oversight, ensuring a comprehensive risk management strategy to ensure compliance.</li></ul><h2 id="what-is-nis2">What is NIS2?</h2><p>NIS2 aims to improve the cybersecurity capabilities across the EU by ensuring a high common level of cybersecurity across member states. NIS2 expands on the previous directive by addressing some gaps and shortcomings identified over the past few years.</p><h2 id="key-changes-introduced-by-nis2">Key Changes Introduced by NIS2</h2><p>NIS2 introduces several significant changes aimed at enhancing cybersecurity measures and ensuring a more uniform implementation across the EU. Some of the key changes include: </p><ul><li><strong>Broader Scope:</strong> NIS2 extends its coverage to more sectors, including public administration, space, manufacturing of critical products, and food supply chains, reflecting the evolving landscape of digital threats. </li><li><strong>Stricter Security Requirements:</strong> The directive sets higher standards for cybersecurity risk management measures, incident reporting, and <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/solutions/supply-chain">supply chain security</a>. Organizations may need to implement a range of technical and organizational measures to protect their networks and information systems. </li><li><strong>Enhanced Cooperation and Information Sharing:</strong>  NIS2 promotes greater cooperation between member states and encourages information sharing among public and private entities to improve the overall security posture.</li><li><strong>Incident Reporting:</strong> Organizations are required to report significant incidents to relevant authorities within 24 hours, ensuring a swift response to potential threats.</li></ul><h2 id="areas-of-focus-for-organizations">Areas of Focus for Organizations</h2><p>Both DORA and NIS2 highlight the importance of risk management, <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/solutions/supply-chain">supply chain security</a>, and development and maintenance of robust incident response plans. In order to adapt to these requirements, there are some key areas for businesses to focus on: </p><h3 id="implementing-both-proactive-and-reactive-processes-towards-mitigating-risk">Implementing both proactive and reactive processes towards mitigating risk</h3><p>Implementing both proactive and reactive processes towards mitigating risk is crucial for true cyber resilience. Proactive measures, such as regular risk assessments, vulnerability scans, and the deployment of security controls, enable organizations to anticipate and prevent potential threats before they materialize. This forward-thinking approach helps to fortify an organizations defenses, ensuring that they are resilient against <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/cyber-threats/emerging-threats">emerging cyber threats</a>. On the other hand, reactive processes, including incident response plans, real-time monitoring, and forensic investigations, can be essential for addressing and mitigating the impact of security incidents when they occur. </p><h3 id="focusing-on-your-third-party-suppliers-as-a-part-of-your-organizations-attack-surface">Focusing on your third-party suppliers as a part of your organizations attack surface</h3><p>Third-party vendors are a critical component to todays modern business, helping to accelerate product deliveries, spur innovation, increase efficiency, and lower average costs. The average company shares confidential information with 583 parties, according to a Ponemon Institute study. Its no surprise why Gartner estimates that by 2025 nearly half of organizations worldwide will have experienced attacks on their software supply chains, a three-fold increase from 2021.  </p><p>The challenge is that more than 2/3 of organizations have a limited, ad hoc understanding, or none at all of their third and fourth party risk. </p><p>Traditionally the primary mechanism for managing down cyber supply chain risk has been through preventative measures: due diligence reviews, lengthy questionnaires, and extensive back and forth communication. These efforts are a blanket approach that is cumbersome, lacks scalability, and is difficult to enforce. Prevention is always an admirable pursuit, but detection is critical, especially in an increasingly connected world.

Key trends include the rise of infostealer malware, which dominated the threat landscape, and a significant 103% surge in Magecart attacks targeting e-commerce platforms. Ransomware groups have also evolved, using new techniques such as passwords to validate execution and prevent analysis. The exploitation of widely used remote access software like Ivanti Secure Connect, PAN-OS, and Microsoft SmartScreen was a focal point for cybercriminals and state-sponsored actors.</p><h2 id="h1-2024-malware-and-vulnerability-trends-report-what-you-need-to-know">H1 2024 Malware and Vulnerability Trends Report: What You Need to Know</h2><p>The first half of 2024 witnessed an escalation in sophisticated cyberattacks, with <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/threat-actors/threat-actor-types">threat actors</a> sharpening their techniques to exploit newly disclosed vulnerabilities, evade detection, and cause greater damage. In this report, we delve into the key trends shaping the cybersecurity landscape and what organizations can do to protect themselves.</p><h2 id="zero-day-vulnerabilities">Zero-day Vulnerabilities</h2><p>Zero-day vulnerabilities, particularly those affecting remote access and security solutions, became prime targets for cybercriminals and state-sponsored groups. Despite the availability of patches, attackers continued exploiting these vulnerabilities, which later became known as n-days. The ease of exploitation, combined with proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code circulating online, made these vulnerabilities attractive to less-sophisticated hackers. The <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/vulnerability-database">top vulnerabilities</a> exploited in H1 2024 included flaws in Ivanti Secure Connect, PAN-OS, and Microsoft Windows SmartScreen.</p><h2 id="infostealers-dominate-the-malware-landscape">Infostealers Dominate the Malware Landscape</h2><p>Infostealers dominated the malware landscape as the most prevalent malware category in the first half of 2024. LummaC2, a stealthy malware designed to harvest sensitive information, became the most active, replacing other well-known <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/shining-light-on-redline-stealer-malware">infostealers like RedLine</a>. These types of malware steal personal information, such as credit card details and login credentials, which are then sold on underground forums. The financial motivation behind these attacks has driven an increase in infostealer activity, posing a severe risk to businesses and individuals alike.</p><h2 id="ransomware-groups-evolve-their-tactics">Ransomware Groups Evolve Their Tactics</h2><p>Ransomware continued to be a significant threat, with groups like Fog, <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/ransomhub-draws-in-affiliates-with-multi-os-capability-and-high-commission-rates">RansomHub</a>, and 3AM adopting tactics to hinder analysis and evade detection. Notably, these ransomware operators began using passwords to validate the execution of their payloads, a technique that prevents security tools from automatically analyzing the malicious code. Additionally, we saw ransomware paired with malware loaders like GuLoader and Remcos, creating attack chains that were more difficult to detect and block.</p><h2 id="magecart-attacks-surge">Magecart Attacks Surge</h2><p><a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/magecart-attacks-the-dark-art-fraudsters-use-to-steal-payment-data">Magecart</a>, a form of cyberattack that targets e-commerce platforms by injecting malicious code to steal customer data, saw a staggering 103% increase in H1 2024. This surge was likely attributed to vulnerabilities in widely used platforms like Adobe Commerce and the appearance of new e-skimming tools, such as &quot;Sniffer by Fleras.&quot; As online retail continues to grow, these attacks present a significant risk to businesses and their customers, highlighting the need for stronger security measures on e-commerce sites.</p><h2 id="how-to-protect-your-organization">How to Protect Your Organization</h2><p>To mitigate the risks posed by these evolving threats, organizations must adopt a layered defense strategy that includes proactive monitoring, patch management, and employee education. Here are key steps to take:</p><ol><li><strong>Improve Patch Management:</strong> Ensure that vulnerabilities, especially in remote access software, are patched promptly. Automating <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/vulnerability-intelligence">patch management</a> can help reduce the window of opportunity for attackers.</li><li><strong>Implement Heuristic and Behavior-Based Detection:</strong> Deploy advanced threat detection systems that can identify suspicious behaviors, such as process hollowing or the use of less-common programming languages, like Lua or NIM.</li><li><strong>Educate Employees:</strong> Social engineering remains a key entry point for malware. Continuous education on phishing tactics and malware distribution methods is critical to reducing human error.</li><li><strong>Strengthen E-commerce Security:</strong> Businesses that rely on e-commerce must prioritize security by regularly auditing third-party integrations, implementing strict content security policies (CSPs), and conducting frequent vulnerability scans.</li></ol><h2 id="looking-ahead-what-to-expect-for-the-rest-of-2024">Looking Ahead: What to Expect for the Rest of 2024</h2><p>The remainder of 2024 will likely see an increase in the exploitation of newly discovered vulnerabilities in widely used enterprise software. Remote access tools and next-generation firewalls are expected to remain key targets due to their widespread use. Additionally, the trend of infostealers dominating the malware landscape will continue as demand for stolen credentials on underground markets persists. Magecart attacks are also expected to remain a serious threat, with attackers continuing to experiment with new e-skimming techniques. </p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2024-0910.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>]]></content:encoded>

At the time, it appeared that global political efforts aimed at curbing spyware abuse were making significant progress. However, Insikt Groups recent findings point to a re-emergence of Predators infrastructure. New infrastructure tied to Predator was detected in multiple countries, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Angola.</p><p>This sophisticated spyware, primarily used by government actors, allows operators to infiltrate devices, gaining access to sensitive data like messages and contacts and even activating cameras and microphones without the users knowledge. </p><p><strong>Changes in Infrastructure and Evasion Tactics</strong></p><p>Predator&#39;s operators have significantly enhanced their infrastructure, adding layers of complexity to evade detection. The new infrastructure includes an additional tier in its multi-tiered delivery system, which anonymizes customer operations, making it even harder to identify which countries are using the spyware. This change makes it more difficult for researchers and cybersecurity defenders to track the spread of Predator.</p><p>Despite these changes, the mode of operation remains largely the same. The spyware likely continues to use both one-click and zero-click attack vectors, exploiting browser vulnerabilities and network access to install itself on targeted devices. Even though there are no reports of fully remote zero-click attacks, like those associated with Pegasus, Predator remains a dangerous tool in the hands of those targeting high-profile individuals.</p><p><strong>High-Profile Targets Remain at Risk</strong></p><p>One of the most concerning aspects of Predators return is its likely continued targeting of high-profile individuals. Politicians, executives, journalists, and activists are at the highest risk due to the intelligence value they hold for governments or other malicious actors. The costly licensing of Predator further suggests that operators reserve its use for strategic, high-value targets.</p><p>This widespread use of mercenary spyware, particularly against political opposition, has sparked concern in regions like the European Union. Investigations in Greece and Poland have already revealed how spyware has been used against opposition figures and journalists, raising serious questions about the legality and ethics of such surveillance.</p><p><strong>Best Practices for Defense</strong></p><p>Given Predator&#39;s renewed presence and the sophistication of its infrastructure, individuals and organizations must stay vigilant. Insikt Group has outlined several defensive measures that can help mitigate the risk of Predator spyware infiltration:</p><ol><li><strong>Regular Software Updates </strong> Keeping devices up to date with the latest security patches is crucial for reducing vulnerabilities that spyware like Predator exploits.</li><li><strong>Device Reboots </strong> Periodically rebooting devices can disrupt spyware operations, though it may not completely eliminate advanced spyware.</li><li><strong>Lockdown Mode </strong> Activating lockdown mode on devices can help block unauthorized access and exploitation attempts.</li><li><strong>Mobile Device Management (MDM) </strong> Implementing MDM systems allows organizations to manage and secure employee devices, ensuring they adhere to security protocols.</li><li><strong>Security Awareness Training </strong> Educating employees about spearphishing and other social engineering tactics can reduce the likelihood of falling victim to spyware attacks.</li></ol><p>These measures are particularly important for individuals in sensitive roles, such as those working in government, civil society, or corporate leadership positions.</p><p><strong>The Future of Spyware and Global Regulations</strong></p><p>Despite efforts to curb the use of spyware, the market for mercenary spyware is expected to grow. As demand for surveillance tools continues, more companies will likely emerge, developing new products and finding ways to bypass security defenses. The profitability of spyware and the competition within the industry make it likely that we will see even more sophisticated tools in the future.</p><p>In response to these threats, global efforts to regulate spyware continue. Investigations like those underway in the European Union may lead to stricter regulations on spyware sales and use. However, until significant international action is taken, Predator and similar tools will remain a persistent threat.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>The re-emergence of Predator spyware is a stark reminder of the growing dangers posed by mercenary spyware. While initial sanctions and public exposure seemed to have diminished its presence, recent developments show that Predator is still very much active. Its infrastructure has evolved, making it harder to track and identify users, but with the right cybersecurity practices in place, individuals and organizations can reduce their risk of becoming targets.</p><p>As the spyware market continues to expand, it is essential for governments and cybersecurity professionals to stay ahead of these threats. Public reporting, ongoing research, and stronger regulations are critical in minimizing the damage caused by tools like Predator.</p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2024-0905.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p><h2>Appendix A  Indicators of Compromise</h2><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td style="font-family:Courier New;background-color:#ffffff;"><strong>Domains:</strong><br>happytotstoys[.]com<br>holidaypriceguide[.]com<br>lesautreseux[.]com<br>masoloyakati[.]com<br>noisyball[.]com<br>nyirangongovrai[.]com<br>toysfourtots[.]com<br>yokananu[.]net<br><br><br><strong>IP Addresses:</strong><br>169.239.129[.]76<br>185.123.102[.]40<br>185.235.137[.]6<br>185.243.113[.]169<br>185.243.113[.]169<br>193.29.56[.]252<br>193.29.59[.]164<br>45.86.163[.]178<br>98.142.253[.]18<br></td></tr></tbody></table><p><br><br></p><h2>Appendix B  Mitre ATT&CK Techniques</h2><table>  <tr>   <td style="background-color:#0071CE;color:#ffffff;font-weight: 700;"><strong>Tactic: Technique</strong></td>   <td style="background-color:#0071CE;color:#ffffff;font-weight: 700;"><strong>ATT&CK Code</strong></td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td><strong>Resource Development: Acquire Infrastructure: Domains</strong></td>   <td><a href="https://app.recordedfuture.com/live/sc/entity/mitre:T1583.003">T1583.001</a></td>  </tr>    <tr>   <td><strong>Resource Development: Acquire Infrastructure: Virtual Private Server</strong></td>   <td><a href="https://app.recordedfuture.com/live/sc/entity/mitre:T1584">T1583.003</a></td>  </tr>    <tr>   <td><strong>Resource Development: Acquire Infrastructure: Server</strong></td>   <td><a href="https://app.recordedfuture.com/live/sc/entity/mitre:T1595.002">T1583.004</a></td>  </tr>    <tr>   <td><strong>Initial Access: Spearphishing Link</strong></td>   <td><a href="https://app.recordedfuture.com/live/sc/entity/mitre:T1190">T1566.002</a></td>  </tr></table>]]></content:encoded>
