            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Editor&#39;s note: The following blog post originally appeared on <a href="https://intelligence2risk.substack.com/">Levi Gundert&#39;s Substack page</a>.</strong></em></p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/fraud_funding_image4_21003de229.png" alt="fraud-funding-image4.png"></p><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>A past conversation with an undercover federal agent who specializes in money laundering revealed staggering amounts of currency moving across geographic boundaries, skirting traditional Anti-Money Laundering (AML) processes. From local and transnational crime syndicates to presidential spouses and those looking to evade sanctions or tax regimes, the need to wash and move illicit funds into reputable banking channels has never been greater. </p><p>The FTs recent AML coverage highlights the scale of the problem and provides timely <a href="https://www.ft.com/search?q=money+laundering">background reading</a> on money laundering networks, suspects, and indictments. One <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/db1fa3d5-ebe7-4612-b8b2-d4ea3f1e1027">story</a> is particularly relevant as it centers around proof of address compliance failures. Coincidentally, address verification is precisely the problem highlighted by a recent Recorded Future Payment Fraud Intelligence (PFI) report.</p><h2 id="big-fraud-and-a-hong-kong-address">Big Fraud and a Hong Kong Address</h2><p>The address in question is:<em>12th Floor, San Toi Building,137-139</em><em>Connaught Road Central, Hong Kong</em></p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/fraud_funding_image2_2e86532b3d.png" alt="fraud-funding-image2.png"><em>The San Toi Building (and 12th-floor visual estimate) provided by Google Maps</em></p><p>The address is linked to two scam website (fraud) clustersdesignated Misspelled and Brand as a Coverwhich share merchant accounts and payment processing logic. The three merchant accounts include CAMHUBSTORE, AQAPAY*xmvmxft, SMARTTECHHK, and gracefashionhub. Hundreds, if not thousands, of scam websites are connected to these merchants.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/fraud_funding_image1_68d61a2cfe.jpg" alt="fraud-funding-image1.jpg"><em>A scam website snapshot.</em> </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/fraud_funding_image5_2cdfd29303.jpg" alt="fraud-funding-image5.jpg"><em>A victim articulates why Camhubstore is a scam site.</em> </p><p>These merchant accounts that process payments for fraudulent, non-existent goods are tied to the 12th floor of the San Toi Building as the registered business address. The address is even placed directly on some of the sites as a contact address. Heres where it gets interesting. The address is listed on the <a href="https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id=46352">U.S. Treasury OFAC list</a> for ties to an <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1932">Iranian terrorism group</a>. </p><p>The 12th floor is presumably large enough to house <a href="https://www.importyeti.com/supplier/fenglong-art">multiple businesses</a> and likely sufficiently small such that <a href="https://www.importyeti.com/addresses/supplier/12-f-san-toi-building-137-139-connaught-road-central">businesses transit through</a> reasonably often. Of course, it would be difficult to draw a direct connection between these merchant accounts and terrorism based on a shared space address. Still, other questions remain, namely: how are these scam merchants acquiring the ability to process payment cards when their physical address is on the OFAC list? </p><h2 id="remedying-aml--kyc-compliance-failures">Remedying AML / KYC Compliance Failures</h2><p>Knowing your customer (KYC) might be difficult when bad actors go to great lengths to obscure their identity and purpose, but this is an egregious case of acquiring banks and payment processors missing obviously <a href="https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/nodes/292373?e=true">problematic</a> contact details.</p><p>Geoff Whites book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lazarus-Heist-Based-hit-podcast/dp/0241554276/"><em>The Lazarus Heist</em>, documented that even routine checks can lead to better outcomes</a>. In it, White details North Korean hackers&#39; inability to transfer a more significant amount (hundreds of millions of dollars) from Bangladesh Bank to a bank branch in Manila because the branch is located on Jupiter Street, and &quot;Jupiter is also the name of a sanctioned Iranian shipping vessel. Addresses matter. </p><p>Suppose the US <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/crypto-banks-relationship-trump-administration-414ff706">pursues a more friendly regulatory environment</a> for cryptocurrencies under President Trump, and exchanges find it easier to acquire bank accounts. In that case, the <a href="https://intelligence2risk.substack.com/p/from-crypto-to-fiat-sneaky-ways-cybercriminals">potential for money laundering</a> may explode without rigorous AML / KYC / KYT efforts. The SEC may have fewer teeth, but banks and processors are still gambling if anyone can obtain a merchant account with little to no compliance checks. </p><p>Indeed, the business incentives are aligned to offer maximum merchant accounts to generate more processing fees, and historically, compliance costs have eroded profitability. However, this may be an emerging opportunity for GenAI. Semi-autonomous agents trained to flag basic AML violations (for example, website contact details listed on OFAC, perhaps) and elastic agents that deploy on demand when a new merchant application is submitted would assist AML compliance efforts and help the financial services industry grappling with a tsunami of fraudulent merchant transactions. </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/fraud_funding_image3_c710d76671.png" alt="fraud-funding-image3.png"></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Discover the rising costs of data breaches, including disruption, legal risks, and lost trust. Learn proactive steps to protect your business from escalating threats.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recorded Futures Insikt Group identified a 76% increase in publicly reported data breaches from 2022 to 2023. While 2024 data is not yet complete, Recorded Future data on validated data breaches project a further 5% increase in 2024 compared to 2023. The scale of this increase in the past two years invites a sense of urgency and concern, especially when the attack surface for data breaches is moving further out of companies control. Based on what we can measure, the costliest impacts of data breaches in the last several years have been operational disruption, legal risks, and declining sales due to churn and loss of customer trust. However, the real risk lies in companies falling behind in their security strategy and failing to adopt a new way of thinking. Our immediate and long-term solutions provide a starting point for effectively addressing this escalating threat. </p><h2 id="data-breaches-are-on-the-rise">Data Breaches Are on the Rise</h2><ul><li>The industries most affected by the 76% increase in data breaches in 2023 were the healthcare, finance, information technology and software, insurance, and manufacturing sectors.</li><li>The insurance sector saw the largest increase in reported data breaches in 2023, with a 178% increase. This was followed by healthcare with a 107% increase and manufacturing with an 81% increase. The sensitivity of these industries data and the cost of disruption to their operations have likely been driving factors for threat actors to target these industries.</li></ul><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/data_breaches_chart_b8e601b5a0.png" alt="Figure 1: Publicly reported data breaches in the top five affected industries In 2022 compared to 2023 (Source: Recorded Future)"><em>Figure 1: Publicly reported data breaches in the top five affected industries In 2022 compared to 2023 (Source: Recorded <a href="https://app.recordedfuture.com/live/sc/1ObI7GMg9WD3">Future</a>)</em></p><h2 id="the-costs-of-data-breaches-continue-to-be-high">The Costs of Data Breaches Continue to be High</h2><ul><li>Research from <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">IBM shows</a> that the average total cost of a data breach reached an all-time high in 2024 of USD 4.88 million. </li><li>The business impacts of data breaches are often easiest to measure right after a breach is detected, such as the four-day outage at an Australian personal loan provider in early 2023 that <a href="https://investors.latitudefinancial.com.au/DownloadFile.axd?file=/Report/ComNews/20230316/02644401.pdf">resulted</a> in what we estimate could have been a revenue disruption of over $6 million USD while security teams mitigated the breach. </li><li>However, impacts can also linger: In Q4 of 2023, after a US genetics testing company confirmed it had been hit by a major data breach, it saw <a href="https://investors.23andme.com/news-releases/news-release-details/23andme-reports-fy2023-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-financial">decreased sales</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/.IXIC:INDEXNASDAQ?window=1Y&comparison=NASDAQ%3AME">underperformed</a> the Nasdaq by approximately 16%. While it was not the only factor at play, the negative media coverage around the data breach is highly likely to have played a role in stock, sales, and revenue underperformance, especially when considered in the context of the <a href="https://connect.sustainalytics.com/hubfs/INV/Thought%20Leadership/Sustainalytics_The%20Impact%20of%20Cyberattacks%20on%20Stock%20Prices_Sep%202022.pdf">extensive</a> <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">literature indicating</a> how cyberattacks can negatively impact stock prices.</li></ul><h2 id="the-causes-are-moving-further-out-of-control">The Causes Are Moving Further Out Of Control</h2><ul><li>As the costs of a data breach increase, the causes of breaches are also moving further out of organizations control. Companies may have robust vulnerability remediation on their infrastructure and devices, but threat actors are increasingly looking for vulnerabilities in third-party software to gain access to more potential victims1. Third-party software providers are critical components of the software supply chain and may not have effectively identified or addressed these vulnerabilities. This lack of remediation exposes the entire ecosystem to heightened risks of compromise, as reliance on <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/outcomes/supply-chain">third-party software expands the attack surface</a>.</li><li>As more and more data is likely hosted on third-party cloud providers, threat actors are abusing exposed administrative accounts (<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/">Valid Accounts</a>) to gain privileged access and exfiltrate data more effectively.  Recorded Futures 2023 Annual Report <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/2023-annual-report">highlighted</a> a 22% increase in validated cyberattacks leveraging the Valid Accounts technique. Based on initial analysis of 2024 data, threat actors continue to abuse valid accounts at various stages of an attack sequencesuch as discovery, privilege escalation, and defense evasionto facilitate data theft. These accounts enable lateral movement within networks to access sensitive systems, facilitate reconnaissance by appearing as normal user activity, and help blend into regular traffic to avoid triggering security alerts.</li></ul><h2 id="getting-ahead-of-the-problem">Getting Ahead of the Problem</h2><p>One immediate action security teams can take to improve their organizations risk profile is to create a vendor catalog to identify all external parties with access to company data. Use of risk management software, such as Recorded Futures <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/data-sheets/third-party-intelligence.pdf">Third-Party Intelligence Module</a>, enables extended visibility across the entire third-party ecosystem to uncover risk exposures and prioritize risk mitigation. </p><p>More long-term actions can also be helpful in mitigating the chances or severity of a data breach: </p><ul><li><a href="https://www.immuta.com/blog/what-is-data-tokenization/">Tokenization</a> or encryption helps to render sensitive data meaningless or inaccessible, respectively, outside of a secure environment. Organizations can reduce exposure to risks associated with storing sensitive data and maintain compliance with data privacy laws and regulations by implementing the appropriate method. An audit of necessary tasks associated with data, and not just the sensitivity of data itself, can help with applying the principle of least privilege effectively. </li><li>Close collaboration between multiple teams   forensics, incident response, and legal and compliance  can more successfully manage the fallout from potential data breaches. If these teams do not already have a good working relationship, chances are low that they will automatically have one in response to a severe and public data breach. As a result, it is a good idea for these teams to know each other well outside of a crisis.</li></ul><p>1 Sources: H1 2024: <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2024-0910.pdf">Malware and Vulnerability Trends Report</a>, <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/enhanced-ransomware-solution-announcement">Recorded Future Ransomware Solution</a>, <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/2024/results-and-analysis-intro/">Verizon 2024 Results and Analysis</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

These centers aim to amplify the Chinese Communist Party&#39;s (CCP) voice on the international stage, <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/elephants-street-dance-chinese-communist-party-appeal-youth-overseas-propaganda">targeting specific audiences</a> with tailored messaging (a strategy known as precise communication). ICCs coordinate local, national, and international resources to build China&#39;s image, share political narratives, and promote economic partnerships.</p><p>By leveraging inauthentic social media amplification, foreign influencers, and collaborations with overseas media, ICCs advance <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/china-propaganda-targets-bbc-uk">Chinas multi-layered propaganda</a> approach. For instance, Fujian&#39;s ICC reportedly manages TikTok accounts targeting Taiwanese audiences, likely including a covert account that is highly critical of the Taiwan government called Two Tea Eggs. On YouTube, the same ICC promotes videos of Taiwanese individuals praising China. These centers are strategically positioned to promote China&#39;s interests during geopolitical crises, despite challenges like limited credibility and resource constraints.</p><h2 id="breaking-the-circle-chinese-communist-party-propaganda-infrastructure-rapidly-expands">Breaking the Circle: Chinese Communist Party Propaganda Infrastructure Rapidly Expands</h2><p><a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/chinas-narrative-war-democracy">China&#39;s efforts to reshape global narratives</a> about its policies, culture, and geopolitical aims have reached new heights with the rapid proliferation of international communication centers (ICCs). Established to amplify the voice of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), these centers are integral to <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/1-key-for-1-lock-chinese-communist-party-strategy-targeted-propaganda">China&#39;s global propaganda apparatus</a> and seek to propel the CCPs precise communication strategy for targeting distinct audiences. Heres a closer look at their functions, strategies, and implications.</p><h2 id="what-are-iccs">What Are ICCs?</h2><p>ICCs are propaganda hubs designed to bring new resources to the CCPs efforts to tell Chinas story by centralizing and streamlining the capabilities of provinces, cities, and smaller jurisdictions. These centers focus on building China&#39;s global image by sharing positive narratives about its culture, economy, and development. Simultaneously, they act as a conduit for political narratives aimed at countering negative perceptions and promoting China&#39;s geopolitical agenda.</p><p>Over 100 ICCs have been established across China, primarily since 2023, under provincial and sub-provincial propaganda departments and state media organizations. These centers aim to &quot;break the circle&quot; to penetrate foreign audiences and tailoring content for specific regions and demographics.</p><h2 id="key-objectives-of-iccs">Key Objectives of ICCs</h2><p>ICCs primarily aim to promote positive narratives about China. They create content that highlights the countrys cultural heritage, technological innovations, and economic progress, fostering goodwill among international audiences. Additionally, ICCs counter negative narratives by responding to perceived anti-China sentiments and disseminating content to influence public opinion on geopolitical topics. By tailoring their approaches to specific regions and demographics, ICCs strive to ensure their narratives resonate more effectively. For example, Fujians ICC specifically targets Taiwanese audiences using TikTok accounts that blend cultural themes with critical political messaging.</p><h2 id="tactics-and-strategies">Tactics and Strategies</h2><p>ICCs employ various tactics to achieve their objectives. <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/china-social-media-operations">Social media operations form a core component of their strategy</a>, with thousands of accounts active across platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok. Many of these accounts lack transparency about their state affiliations, enabling covert influence campaigns. Additionally, ICCs leverage foreign influencers and communication officers to amplify Chinas narratives through user-generated content, vlogs, and experiential propaganda.</p><p>Collaboration with overseas media organizations further enhances ICCs&#39; reach and legitimacy. Through actions like organizing foreign journalist visits to China, ICCs create an impression of organic coverage and offer an alternative to Western narratives. These partnerships  reportedly established in Australia, Brazil, Cambodia, Egypt, France, Japan, Russia, the United States, and elsewhere  are complemented by localized propaganda activities that align with Chinas economic and geopolitical interests. S</p><h2 id="challenges-to-success">Challenges to Success</h2><p>Despite ambitious goals, ICCs face significant challenges that hinder their effectiveness. These include a lack of professional and foreign talent, insufficient discourse power, inadequate data for precise communication, and inconsistent funding. ICCs often struggle to translate local developments into effective narratives for foreign audiences and lack focus on target demographics. Many rely heavily on central state media infrastructure, as seen with the Nanning International Communication Center outsourcing key operations to Xinhua News Agency. These limitations echo long-standing issues within China&#39;s state media sector.</p><h2 id="implications">Implications</h2><p>ICCs represent a sophisticated evolution in China&#39;s propaganda efforts. While they are unlikely to become trusted sources of information in the near term, their ability to amplify preferred narratives during geopolitical crises is likely significant. These centers likely have the potential to influence foreign opinion of China by offering regular engagement, providing alternatives to Western sources, and focusing on topics like quality of life in China rather than political values, especially among Global South and Western periphery audiences.</p><h2 id="outlook">Outlook</h2><p>The expansion of international communication centers (ICCs) reflects China&#39;s ongoing efforts to innovate its media strategy, centralize resources, and project global narratives favoring its interests under Xi Jinping&#39;s leadership. Despite challenges, ICCs likely strengthen China&#39;s ability to influence global discourse by leveraging thousands of overt and covert social media accounts and fostering collaborations with foreign media. These centers could amplify assertive messaging during crises and suppress negative coverage of China.</p><p>China&#39;s long-term goal is almost certainly to establish ICC-affiliated platforms as trusted sources of information. While this remains unlikely in the near term due to credibility challenges, ICCs represent a strategic step toward improving Chinas external propaganda system. Researchers and governments should prioritize tracking ICC activities and advocating for transparent labeling of their state affiliations on social media platforms.</p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/ta-cn-2024-1210.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png"></p><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>Scam websites have emerged as a significant threat in financial fraud, leveraging seasonal opportunities and advanced tactics to deceive cardholders and evade bank defenses. Recorded Future&#39;s Payment Fraud Intelligence team has identified that threat actors operate these scams across five stages: procurement, lure creation, delivery, website setup, and monetization. They exploit psychological triggers and seasonal trends like holidays and shopping events to maximize victim susceptibility.</p><p>Key methods include phishing kits, fraudulent merchant accounts, and live admin panels that enhance the effectiveness of scams while complicating detection. Threat actors use techniques such as typosquatting, malvertising, and smishing to deliver scam lures, while their websites are designed to trick victims into sharing sensitive information.</p><h2 id="scam-websites-understanding-the-threat-and-combating-fraud">Scam Websites: Understanding the Threat and Combating Fraud</h2><p>Scam websites have become a growing concern in recent years, posing risks not only to individual cardholders but also to financial institutions and merchants. These websites, often indistinguishable from legitimate platforms, exploit seasonal opportunities and sophisticated tactics to defraud victims at scale. This research explores how scam websites operate, the methods used by threat actors, and actionable strategies for mitigation.</p><h2 id="stages-of-scam-website-operations">Stages of Scam Website Operations</h2><p>Scam website operations follow five distinct stages:</p><ol><li><strong>Procurement</strong><br>Threat actors gather resources such as domains, phishing kits, and fraudulent merchant accounts. Seasonal trends play a significant role, with typosquatting and scam kits tailored to holidays or shopping events like Black Friday.</li><li><strong>Lure Creation</strong><br>Scammers design lures that exploit urgency and trust. Common methods include brand impersonation, limited-time offers, and fear tactics during tax season.</li><li><strong>Lure Delivery</strong><br>Lures are distributed through online ads, smishing (SMS phishing), and phishing emails. Social media and search engines are frequently exploited for large-scale delivery.</li><li><strong>Website Setup</strong><br>Scam websites mirror legitimate sites to deceive victims into entering sensitive data. Payment forms and account update requests are designed to appear authentic.</li><li><strong>Monetization</strong><br>Threat actors leverage stolen data for card-not-present (CNP) fraud, resale on dark web forums, or fraudulent transactions through merchant accounts.</li></ol><p>Seasonal trends significantly increase the effectiveness of scam websites. Holidays, tax filing periods, and shopping events create urgency among victims, making them more likely to fall for scams. For example, Black Friday scams use high discounts to lure victims, while tax season scams exploit fear of penalties.</p><p>Sophisticated methods like live admin panels and payment cloaking make scams harder to detect. Live admin panels allow real-time interception of victim data and OTPs (one-time passwords), enabling high-success fraud.</p><p>Additionally, threat actors use fraudulent merchant accounts linked to scam websites, allowing immediate monetization and recurring charges. These tactics complicate fraud detection and recovery efforts for banks and cardholders alike.</p><h2 id="mitigation-strategies">Mitigation Strategies</h2><p>To combat scam websites, both financial institutions and individuals must take proactive measures:</p><ul>        <li><strong>For Financial Institutions:</strong></li>    <ul>        <li>Monitor dark web forums for phishing kits and merchant account offerings.</li>        <li>Educate customers about common scam tactics and encourage reporting.</li>        <li>Leverage <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/payment-fraud-intelligence">Recorded Future Payment Fraud intelligence</a> (PFI) to detect and mitigate possible scam websites using the PFI common-point-of-purchase (CPP) dataset.</li>        <li>Leverage <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/brand-intelligence">Recorded Future Brand Intelligence</a> to detect and mitigate brand impersonation threats common among scam websites.</li>    </ul></ul>    <ul>        <li><strong>For Individuals:</strong></li>    <ul>        <li>Verify website URLs and use only trusted platforms for transactions.</li>        <li>Avoid acting on unsolicited offers or advertisements without verification.</li>        <li>Report suspected scams to banks and dispute fraudulent charges promptly.</li>    </ul></ul><h2 id="outlook">Outlook</h2><p>Scam website operations are rapidly evolving, with threat actors adopting sophisticated tactics reminiscent of early Magecart e-skimmer methods. Notable developments include scam campaigns targeting mobile users to evade detection and using low-value transactions to establish trust before initiating high-value fraud. Fraudulent merchant accounts, linked to scam websites, have become a key innovation, enabling immediate and recurring monetization while complicating detection.</p><p>This method is likely to grow in prominence, especially as future PCI-DSS v4.0 requirements limit other fraud techniques. However, regulatory measures like the US FTC&#39;s &quot;click-to-cancel&quot; rule and stricter Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols could significantly curb these operations by addressing loopholes that scammers currently exploit.</p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2024-1126.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png"></p><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>Operation Undercut is a covert influence operation conducted by Russias Social Design Agency (SDA) to sway public opinion against Ukraine and weaken Western support. Leveraging AI-enhanced videos and impersonating reputable news sources, Operation Undercut disseminates disinformation targeting audiences across the US, Ukraine, and Europe. This operation, running in tandem with other campaigns like <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/russian-influence-network-doppelgangers-ai-content-tactics">Doppelgnger</a>, is designed to discredit Ukraines leadership, question the effectiveness of Western aid, and stir socio-political tensions. The campaign also seeks to shape narratives around the 2024 US elections and geopolitical conflicts, such as the Israel-Gaza situation, to deepen divisions.</p><h2 id="operation-undercut-shows-multifaceted-nature-of-sdas-influence-operations">&quot;Operation Undercut&quot; Shows Multifaceted Nature of SDAs Influence Operations</h2><p>Russia&#39;s Social Design Agency (SDA) has been running an influence operation known as &quot;Operation Undercut&quot; since late 2023, aiming to <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/russia-seeks-exploit-western-war-fatigue-win-ukraine">erode Western support for Ukraine</a>. Using a mix of AI-enhanced media and impersonation tactics, Operation Undercut employs advanced methods to manipulate public opinion. </p><h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2><p>Operation Undercut is part of Russia&#39;s broader strategy to destabilize Western alliances and portray Ukraines leadership as ineffective and corrupt. By targeting audiences in Europe and the US, the SDA seeks to amplify anti-Ukraine sentiment, hoping to reduce the flow of Western military aid to Ukraine. The operation also spreads narratives that suggest US and EU involvement in Ukraine is misguided, costly, and largely ineffective.</p><p>In addition to undermining support for Ukraine, Operation Undercut <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/russian-information-operations-divide-western-coalition-ukraine">seeks to widen existing divisions within Western societies</a>. The campaign addresses several geopolitical issues, such as the Israel-Gaza conflict, the EU&#39;s internal politics, and the <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/malign-influence-threats-mount-ahead-us-2024-elections">2024 US elections</a>. By connecting Ukraine&#39;s fate to these contentious topics, Operation Undercut attempts to stoke anxieties and polarize public opinion.</p><h2 id="tactics-techniques-and-procedures-ttps">Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)</h2><p><strong>AI-Enhanced Videos and Impersonation of News Outlets</strong></p><p>Operation Undercut uses <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/adversarial-intelligence-red-teaming-malicious-use-cases-ai">AI-enhanced videos and images, many of which mimic trusted media sources</a>, to make disinformation appear credible. AI-generated voiceovers and realistic images amplify these narratives, creating content that is difficult to distinguish from legitimate news. By adopting branding elements from respected outlets, the operation enhances its contents believability, misleading audiences and eroding trust in genuine media sources.</p><p><strong>Targeted Social Media Campaigns</strong></p><p>SDA&#39;s accounts post highly tailored content on multiple platforms, often using trending hashtags to reach target audiences. The content varies by region and language, including posts in English, German, French, Polish, and Turkish, ensuring that messages resonate across diverse audiences. By focusing on real-time issues, the operation maximizes its reach, though most posts have shown limited engagement.</p><p><strong>Amplification of CopyCop Content</strong></p><p>Operation Undercut has amplified content from <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/copycop-expands-to-cover-us-elections-target-political-leaders">CopyCop (also known as Storm-1516), a Russian influence network</a> linked to John Mark Dougan and allegedly backed by Alexander Dugin&#39;s Centre for Geopolitical Expertise (CGE) and the GRU&#39;s Unit 29155. Examples include a <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/deepfakes-id-verification">deepfake video</a> featuring a supposed Hamas member threatening the 2024 Paris Olympics and an image accusing Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky of buying an Italian villa during the 2024 G7 summit.</p><h2 id="key-narratives">Key Narratives</h2><p><strong>Discrediting Ukraine and Western Aid</strong></p><p>One of Operation Undercuts primary themes is discrediting Ukraines leadership and questioning the effectiveness of Western aid. The campaign accuses Ukrainian leaders of corruption, claiming they misuse foreign aid to fund luxurious lifestyles. This narrative aims to undermine public support for continued financial and military assistance to Ukraine, particularly among European audiences.</p><p><strong>Exploiting the Israel-Gaza Conflict</strong></p><p>The operation also attempts to manipulate public opinion regarding the Israel-Gaza conflict, alleging Western bias and intelligence manipulation. By highlighting divisive issues in global politics, Operation Undercut creates distractions and deepens divides, weakening Western alliances and distracting from Russia&#39;s involvement in Ukraine.</p><p><strong>Tensions Within the EU and US Election Influence</strong></p><p>Operation Undercut amplifies existing political tensions within the European Union by supporting far-right narratives and criticizing EU leaders. Similarly, it seeks to influence the 2024 US elections by framing military aid to Ukraine as a contentious political issue. By presenting Ukraines future as contingent on US election outcomes, the operation fosters anxiety over the West&#39;s political stability.</p><h2 id="mitigations">Mitigations</h2><ul><li>News organizations should track content from known influence actors who are likely abusing their brand. Such abuse increases reputational risks and erodes consumer trust, potentially deterring advertisers and inflicting financial harm on the impersonated organizations.</li><li>Political leaders and government officials from countries providing support to Ukraine should continue monitoring for content attempting to discredit them to identify and counter emerging narratives.</li><li>Public and news organizations can use <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/brand-intelligence">Recorded Future Brand Intelligence</a> to track and combat typosquatting domains and infringing content on similar domains, which can harm a news organizations reputation.</li><li>Clients can use the <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform/intelligence-cloud">Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud</a> to track Operation Undercut activity and Recorded Future AI to summarize and track emerging narratives.</li></ul><h2 id="outlook">Outlook</h2><p>The SDA is expected to continue running influence operations, including Operation Undercut, while likely rebuilding infrastructure for Doppelgnger and using established content and amplification tactics. Tasked by Russias Presidential Administration, these operations aim to shape global opinions on Ukraine and exploit major events to undermine support for Ukraine. The investigation, which uses data from Recorded Future, government sources, and other reports, underscores the value of a collaborative approach across sectors to expose and disrupt these destabilizing activities. </p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/TA-RU-2024-1126.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png"></p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>Insikt Group has identified an ongoing cyber-espionage campaign conducted by TAG-110, a Russia-aligned threat group targeting organizations in Central Asia, East Asia, and Europe. Using custom malware tools HATVIBE and CHERRYSPY, TAG-110 primarily attacks government entities, human rights groups, and educational institutions. The campaigns tactics align with the historical activities of UAC-0063, attributed to Russian APT group BlueDelta (APT28). HATVIBE functions as a loader to deploy CHERRYSPY, a Python backdoor used for data exfiltration and espionage. Initial access is often achieved through phishing emails or exploiting vulnerable web-facing services like Rejetto HTTP File Server.</p><p>TAG-110s efforts are likely part of a broader Russian strategy to gather intelligence on geopolitical developments and maintain influence in post-Soviet states. Insikt Group provides actionable insights, including indicators of compromise and Snort and YARA rules, to help organizations.</p><hr><h2 id="russia-aligned-tag-110-targets-asia-and-europe-with-hatvibe-and-cherryspy">Russia-Aligned TAG-110 Targets Asia and Europe with HATVIBE and CHERRYSPY</h2><p>Advanced persistent threat (APT) groups aligned with nation-states continue to execute sophisticated campaigns to fulfill strategic objectives. Insikt Group recently identified a Russia-aligned cyber-espionage campaign conducted by TAG-110 targeting organizations across Central Asia, East Asia, and Europe. This group deploys custom malware, including HATVIBE and CHERRYSPY, to conduct operations aligned with Russian geopolitical interests.</p><h3 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h3><ul><li><strong>TAG-110 Overview:</strong> A threat group overlapping with UAC-0063, TAG-110 is linked to the Russian APT group BlueDelta (APT28) with moderate confidence.</li><li><strong>Targets:</strong> Governments, human rights groups, and educational institutions in Central Asia and neighboring regions.</li><li><strong>Malware Used:</strong> HATVIBE, a custom HTML application loader, and CHERRYSPY, a Python-based backdoor, are central to the campaign.</li><li><strong>Scale of Impact:</strong> Since July 2024, 62 victims across eleven countries have been identified, with notable incidents in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan.</li></ul><h3 id="hatvibe">HATVIBE</h3><p>HATVIBE serves as a loader for deploying additional malware like CHERRYSPY. Delivered via malicious email attachments or exploited web-facing vulnerabilities, it achieves persistence through scheduled tasks executed by the mshta.exe utility.</p><p>HATVIBEs obfuscation techniques include VBScript encoding and XOR encryption. Once deployed, it communicates with command-and-control (C2) servers using HTTP PUT requests, providing critical system details.</p><h3 id="cherryspy">CHERRYSPY</h3><p>CHERRYSPY, a Python-based backdoor, complements HATVIBE by enabling secure data exfiltration. It uses robust encryption methods, including RSA and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), to establish communication with its C2 servers. TAG-110 uses CHERRYSPY to monitor victims systems and extract sensitive information, often targeting government and research entities.</p><h3 id="campaign-objectives">Campaign Objectives</h3><p>TAG-110s activities align with Russias geopolitical objectives, particularly in Central Asia, where Moscow seeks to maintain influence amid strained relations. Intelligence gathered through these campaigns likely aids in bolstering Russias military efforts and understanding regional dynamics.</p><h3 id="mitigation-strategies">Mitigation Strategies</h3><p>To defend against TAG-110 and similar threats, organizations should:</p><ol><li><strong>Monitor for Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):</strong> Use intrusion detection systems (IDSs), intrusion prevention systems (IPSs), and network defense tools to detect malicious domains and IPs associated with TAG-110.</li><li><strong>Deploy Detection Rules:</strong> Leverage Snort, Suricata, and YARA rules for identifying HATVIBE and CHERRYSPY-related activities.</li><li><strong>Patch Vulnerabilities:</strong> Ensure timely updates of software to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities like CVE-2024-23692.</li><li><strong>Enhance Threat Awareness:</strong> Train employees to recognize phishing attempts and enforce multi-factor authentication.</li><li><strong>Leverage Intelligence Tools:</strong> Use Recorded Futures solutions for digital risk protection, credential monitoring, and real-time threat intelligence.</li></ol><h3 id="outlook">Outlook</h3><p>TAG-110 is expected to continue its cyber-espionage campaigns, focusing on post-Soviet Central Asian states, Ukraine, and Ukraines allies. These regions are significant to Moscow due to strained relations following Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine. While TAG-110s ties to BlueDelta remain unconfirmed, its activities align with BlueDeltas strategic interests in national security, military operations, and geopolitical influence.</p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/CTA-RU-2024-1121.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p><h2>Appendix A  Indicators of Compromise</h2><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td style="font-family:Courier New;background-color:#ffffff;"><strong>C2 Domains:</strong><br>enrollmentdm[.]com<br>errorreporting[.]net<br>experience-improvement[.]com<br>game-wins[.]com<br>internalsecurity[.]us<br>lanmangraphics[.]com<br>retaildemo[.]info<br>shared-rss[.]info<br>telemetry-network[.]com<br>tieringservice[.]com<br>trust-certificate[.]net<br><br><strong>C2 IP Addresses:</strong><br>5.45.70[.]178<br>45.136.198[.]18<br>45.136.198[.]184<br>45.136.198[.]189<br>46.183.219[.]228<br>84.32.188[.]23<br>185.62.56[.]47<br>185.158.248[.]198<br>185.167.63[.]42<br>194.31.55[.]131<br>212.224.86[.]69<br><br></td></tr></tbody></table>            <p><br><br></p><h2>Appendix B  Mitre ATT&CK Techniques</h2><table style="background-color:#ffffff;"><tr><td style="background-color:#0071CE;color:#ffffff;font-weight: 700;"><strong>Tactic: Technique</strong></td><td style="background-color:#0071CE;color:#ffffff;font-weight: 700;"><strong>ATT&CK Code</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Resource Development:</strong> Acquire Infrastructure: Virtual Private Server</td><td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/003/" rel="nofollow noopener">T1583.003</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Initial Access:</strong> Exploit Public-Facing Application</td><td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/" rel="nofollow noopener">T1190</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Initial Access:</strong> Spearphishing Attachment</td><td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001/" rel="nofollow noopener">T1566.001</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Execution:</strong> Visual Basic</td><td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/005/" rel="nofollow noopener">T1059.005</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Execution:</strong> Malicious File</td><td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/002/" rel="nofollow noopener">T1204.002</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Persistence:</strong> Scheduled Task</td><td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/005/" rel="nofollow noopener">T1053.005</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Defense Evasion:</strong> Encrypted/Encoded File</td><td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/013/" rel="nofollow noopener">T1027.013</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Defense Evasion:</strong> System Binary Proxy Execution: Mshta</td><td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218/005/" rel="nofollow noopener">T1218.005</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Command-and-Control:</strong> Web Protocols</td><td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/001/" rel="nofollow noopener">T1071.001</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Command-and-Control:</strong> Symmetric Cryptography</td><td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1573/001/" rel="nofollow noopener">T1573.001</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Command-and-Control:</strong> Asymmetric Cryptography</td><td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1573/002/" rel="nofollow noopener">T1573.002</a></td></tr></table>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[From Magecart to Mobile Menaces]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Editor&#39;s note: The following blog post originally appeared on <a href="https://intelligence2risk.substack.com/">Levi Gundert&#39;s Substack page</a>.</strong></em></p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/9530ea14_3d82_4c7a_beac_a3260db82f1b_1024x1024_1284675518.webp" alt="9530ea14-3d82-4c7a-beac-a3260db82f1b_1024x1024.webp"></p><p><a href="https://cxotoday.com/specials/gartner-why-cyber-fraud-fusion-is-the-future-of-online-fraud-detection/">Gartner estimates</a> that 5% of large enterprises currently maintain cyber-fraud fusion centers, which is expected to jump to 20% by 2028. Fusion sounds high speed, but bringing together multiple teams for a shared mission can slow down operations if not managed effectively. A traditional <a href="https://www.comptia.org/content/articles/what-is-a-security-operations-center">SOC</a> masquerading as a fusion center with little more than <a href="https://threatbutt.com/map/">pew pew maps</a> (not to diminish their effectiveness with executives) defeats the purpose. A successful fusion center removes data silos and works across traditionally divided teams (e.g., Incident Response, Cyber Threat Intelligence, Fraud)  to improve threat actor campaign analysis and reduce losses. Cyber-fraud fusion centers improve communication and collaboration through organizational (and perhaps physical) proximity, leading to better fraud loss reduction outcomes. </p><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>Before exposing cyber-fraud data flows and focused loss mitigation examples, a few words about the problem and a prerequisite for success. In January, Nasdaq released a <a href="https://ir.nasdaq.com/news-releases/news-release-details/nasdaq-releases-first-global-financial-crime-report-measuring">remarkable report</a> that quantified illicit money movement, including losses from fraud scams and bank fraud schemes accounted for nearly $500 billion globally in 2023. That number is a significant enticement for threat actors to continue with successful tactics while also investing in new fraud innovations. </p><p>A thriving fusion center requires a leader with vision and experience (in cyber defense operations and fraud) and the mandate authority (juice) to remove traditional enterprise barriers (organizational empire building, information gatekeeping, vendor firewalling, etc.). </p><h2 id="improved-data-driven-workflows">Improved Data-Driven Workflows</h2><p>The fusion concept is vital in this fraud context because CTI analysts generally focus on identifying malicious fraud communities and associated TTPs (tools, tactics, procedures). Fraud analysts, conversely, are concerned with creating fraud analytics toward enhanced remediation. In traditional organizations, the CTI and fraud teams sit in separate departments and are constrained by politically driven data silos.  Optimized information workflows for maximum fraud impact remain elusive. When implemented correctly, cyber-fraud fusion centers remove perverse incentives and enable a unified team to make the organization more effective. </p><p>In each of these examples, well examine how CTI can enrich fraud investigations and help shift from a reactive to a proactive posture (though overused, this proactive notion is appropriate here).</p><h2 id="example-alpha---payment-cards">Example Alpha - Payment Cards</h2><p>A straightforward example includes payment card fraud (card present - CP and card not present - CNP). CTI teams will identify and collect in criminal forums, marketplaces, and other communities where stolen full or partial payment card details are advertised and sold. </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/1f81209f_bc4c_4662_b3d9_c6a17381ef73_1304x569_345c0e0036.webp" alt="1f81209f-bc4c-4662-b3d9-c6a17381ef73_1304x569.webp"></p><p><em>An example database of stolen payment cards.</em> </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/535efde5_1747_44a8_b9d0_bd0e4034c0dc_495x656_c8efd83945.webp" alt="535efde5-1747-44a8-b9d0-bd0e4034c0dc_495x656.webp"></p><p><em>Stolen payment card services branding.</em></p><p>A fraud team workflow may include:</p><ul><li>Identify at-risk cards and monitor the associated portfolio exposure in real time</li><li>Track fraud mitigation turnaround time as a primary KPI (key performance indicator). </li><li>Reduce criminal interest in specific payment card portfolios</li><li>Decrease false-positive rates in risk-scoring solutions</li><li>Conduct CPP (common point of purchase) analysis before chargeback data arrives</li></ul><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/5436d892_398d_443a_b3f6_8d891ec8d80e_2145x396_eb07654c2a.webp" alt="5436d892-398d-443a-b3f6-8d891ec8d80e_2145x396.webp"></p><p><em>A Telegram-sourced conversation - courtesy of Recorded Future - regarding defeating fraud detection mechanisms.</em></p><p>Commonly used fraud controls include KYC (Know Your Customer) rules, test transaction monitoring (a strong fraud precursor signal), CAMS (Compromised Account Management Systems) alerts, and CPP (common point of purchase) analysis. The issue is that all of these controls are reactive. CTI, when done well, changes the paradigm in that intelligence is proactively driving fraud prevention, reducing the efficacy of fraudster tactics, and traditional fraud controls become deprecated as a first line of defense. </p><h2 id="example-beta---pii--ato">Example Beta - PII &amp; ATO</h2><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/cb68aecb_6515_45cc_a06f_914f86d9cdd2_2145x1393_dc05e28a4d.webp" alt="cb68aecb-6515-45cc-a06f-914f86d9cdd2_2145x1393.webp"></p><p><em>Recorded Future AI insights and cashout service branding.</em></p><p>Some organizations (e.g., retailers) may not issue payment cards, but experience heavy fraud losses due to the unauthorized access of personally identifiable information (in the U.S., valuable PII for fraud may include: physical address, email address, date of birth, social security number, phone number, mothers maiden name, etc.), which is subsequently used to tailor social engineering attacks that lead to account takeover (ATO). This is also true for banks. A stolen payment card may be quickly identified and re-issued, but the associated stolen PII may lead to fraud losses through call center social engineering and/or online channel security bypass. The unauthorized access to online accounts may lead to unauthorized money movement to mules who specialize in maintaining bank accounts to receive stolen funds and cash out.</p><p>In another life, working with banks, we engaged fraudsters online to identify previously dormant cash-out accounts. At the time, even if a victim wasnt participating in online account access, fraudsters would enroll victims using stolen PII and create the necessary authentication details (username, password, etc.). Out of convenience, all compromised accounts contained the same password. </p><p>ATO mechanisms include MFA prompt fatigue (the victim is tired of selecting no and seeing a dialogue prompt reappear), <a href="https://therecord.media/hackers-breached-california-state-welfare">credential stuffing / brute forcing</a>, social engineering, <a href="https://therecord.media/sec-twitter-account-hack-arrest-alabama">SIM swapping</a>, password resets, etc. Naturally, GenAI is reducing the time to prepare and deliver while increasing the quality of <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/qr-code-and-ai-generated-phishing-proliferate">social engineering campaigns</a>. ATO and associated cashout techniques are constantly changing. Fraud professionals collaborating with CTI will help identify the right threat actors for engagement to further intelligence objectives that lead to fraud control improvements. </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/521d5535_f191_49e8_ba94_b72acbb73d69_1600x853_0ccd523888.webp" alt="521d5535-f191-49e8-ba94-b72acbb73d69_1600x853.webp"></p><p><em>An infostealer coterie - Lumma, Vidar, Raccoon, Redline.</em></p><p>Additionally, infostealers (a specific label for a malware genus focused on extracting all victim PII and more from web browsers) have stolen billions of victim credentials, cookie values, and more. This data treasure trove enables fraudsters to use valid credentials and quickly achieve ATO for both social engineering and direct money movement in financial services platforms.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/d5587f91_764b_4ee8_99b5_fc179997512d_1525x959_1087a20ab1.webp" alt="d5587f91-764b-4ee8-99b5-fc179997512d_1525x959.webp"></p><p><em>Recorded Future AI Insights for ATO channels.</em></p><h2 id="focused-examples">Focused Examples</h2><p><strong>Example Charlie - Magecart Compromised Merchants</strong></p><p><a href="https://therecord.media/canadas-largest-alcohol-retailer-infected-with-card-skimming-malware-twice-since-december">Magecart</a> is the label for specific malicious scripts (code) loaded into vulnerable e-commerce platforms to skim payment card details during customer payment. As previously mentioned, Magecart victims may have to consider more than just replacing their payment cards in <a href="https://substack.com/@intelligence2risk/note/c-73182811">certain shopping contexts</a>. </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/0c4e1515_0f4f_49a7_8a9b_7bf43759b661_1600x674_16619fe6a3.webp" alt="0c4e1515-0f4f-49a7-8a9b-7bf43759b661_1600x674.webp"></p><p><em>A Magecart data flow diagram.</em></p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/f94439ab_c01b_49de_99b0_778eac9a338f_975x535_5b2b7e6213.webp" alt="f94439ab-c01b-49de-99b0-778eac9a338f_975x535.webp"></p><p><em>Details of e-skimmer code illustrating customer fields for exfiltration.</em></p><p>Proactive Magecart intelligence is important for e-commerce retailers and financial services companies advising and alerting retailers, specifically small and medium-sized companies with fewer resources to invest in security. Magecart TTP evolutions require corresponding agile detections. Several historical Magecart operating changes observed by Recorded Futures Payment Fraud Intelligence (PFI) team include:</p><ul><li>Using Google Tag Manager</li><li>Payment card data exfiltration to Telegram </li><li>Hiding malicious scripts within SVG elements and using stenography</li><li>Using compromised websites as proxies to distribute malicious payloads</li></ul><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/5627b94a_8ab0_4f08_915e_d67e1e8a22f8_1183x808_f7f9ed594d.webp" alt="5627b94a-8ab0-4f08-915e-d67e1e8a22f8_1183x808.webp"></p><p>Fraud teams can track the monetization paths and timelines post-compromise, while CTI teams can actively help identify magecart-victimized merchants before the monetization clock starts. </p><p><strong>Example Delta - Scam Merchants</strong></p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/7b868a76_5e3d_41a8_bd37_336998c1b4ed_2145x972_18a6e4265a.webp" alt="7b868a76-5e3d-41a8-bd37-336998c1b4ed_2145x972.webp"></p><p><em>A verified scam retail website.</em></p><p>A comprehensive strategy to uncover scam merchants involves open-source research, collaboration with industry partners, and advanced data analysis. Organizations can source suspicious websites by monitoring social media advertisements, reviewing domain registration details, and investigating patterns in merchant account behavior. Further validation of potential scam websites can be achieved by correlating domain data with cards exposed on the dark web, identifying common patterns across fraudulent sites, and leveraging consumer reports of suspicious activity. By integrating these insights, organizations can avoid emerging threats and effectively mitigate payment fraud risks.</p><p><strong>Example Echo - Android Banking Trojans</strong></p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/c03e972d_e0d3_438d_a8d2_8b5a9a2c1195_657x548_ddeb83cead.webp" alt="c03e972d-e0d3-438d-a8d2-8b5a9a2c1195_657x548.webp"></p><p>Mobile malware is particularly pernicious in retail banking geographies outside of North America. Recorded Future observes thousands of malicious files with anti-virus signature names like <a href="https://app.recordedfuture.com/portal/intelligence-card/kDbVGx/overview">Hydra</a>, <a href="https://app.recordedfuture.com/portal/intelligence-card/ppu8fm/overview">Hook</a>, <a href="https://app.recordedfuture.com/portal/intelligence-card/jtLozO/overview">Sova</a>, and more every quarter. For example, <a href="https://thethaiger.com/hot-news/bank-of-thailand-warns-of-elevated-financial-cybercrime-risk">Thailand has been alerting</a> citizens to the dangers of installing unverified Android applications, which could drain their bank accounts. While mobile malware generally contains <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/predator-spyware-operators-rebuild-multi-tier-infrastructure-target-mobile-devices">many features</a> (e.g., accessing location services, camera snooping, reading/sending SMS, etc.) that achieve device takeover (DTO), creating <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Man-in-the-browser_attack">man-in-the-browser (MitB)</a> capabilities during online banking sessions is the most impactful for fraud losses because traditional <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/blogs/threat-session-hijacking-mfa-bypass">multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a> mechanisms become less effective when all communications channels can be intercepted and manipulated, leading to account takeover (ATO). </p><p>Again, while financial services fraud teams and government investigators have digital exhaust to follow after victimization, CTI teams should create alerts and dissect new mobile malware TTPs to better educate the banking and online shopping public (and pursue attribution). </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/c2bb4a00_97c2_4e27_9e36_d74fec23fe3d_1050x481_cdc65cd849.webp" alt="c2bb4a00-97c2-4e27-9e36-d74fec23fe3d_1050x481.webp"></p><p><em>A sample of malware tags derived from <a href="https://tria.ge/">Hatching Triage</a>.</em></p><p>Additionally, real-time notification of new mobile malware samples with associated meta-data improves bank prevention/detection systems via atomic indicators (e.g., user-agent strings, IP addresses, etc.) and internal log correlation. </p><p><strong>Example Foxtrot - Stolen Checks</strong></p><p>Physical (paper) checks are a relic of the banking system employed primarily in North America. Because these documents contain a routing and account number, they are still heavily used in <a href="https://abc7ny.com/check-washing-fraud-scam-money/12925374/">fraud</a>. Older generations are vulnerable as they may <a href="https://www.atlantafed.org/-/media/documents/banking/consumer-payments/research-data-reports/2020/02/13/us-consumers-use-of-personal-checks-evidence-from-a-diary-survey/rdr2001.pdf">prefer checks</a> for a reliable payment mechanism over other <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/payment-methods/2022/why-fintechs-are-turning-paper-checks-into-money-mobility-instruments/">fintech options</a>, which are perceived as potentially less reliable. </p><p>The CTI opportunity is to use <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/optical-character-recognition">optical character recognition (OCR)</a> for check image recognition in online criminal communities and proactively work with a fraud team to neutralize the inevitable fraud before victims report it. </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/31102a54_a814_49a8_a8c2_9da1be6c3d4a_1200x1595_d241c26fb1.webp" alt="31102a54-a814-49a8-a8c2-9da1be6c3d4a_1200x1595.webp"></p><p><em>Stolen checks are shared in an online criminal community.</em></p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Strong leadership, clear expectations, and success measures are prerequisites for cyber-fraud fusion centers. By better understanding these complimentary workflows in:</p><ul><li>Payment card theft </li><li>E-commerce skimming</li><li>Physical checks</li><li>Mobile malware</li><li>Account takeover (ATO) and cash-out</li><li>Scam merchants</li></ul><p>fraud and CTI resources (human or machine) can better architect and deliver improved organizational fraud loss value. </p><p><em>Thank you to Recorded Futures Payment Fraud Intelligence (PFI) team and Insikt Group for their foundational work in enabling this blog and their continued excellence in malicious cyber fraud campaign analysis.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

Recent incidents, including break-ins at water treatment facilities in Finland and explosions at arms factories in Poland, highlight Russias use of gray zone tactics to undermine Western military, economic, and political capabilities without crossing the threshold of open conflict. Insikt Groups analysis identifies a pattern of Russian hybrid warfare involving covert operatives, agent networks, and plausible deniability tactics that echo Soviet-era sabotage strategies. With these tactics, <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/russia-seeks-exploit-western-war-fatigue-win-ukraine">Russia aims to degrade NATOs capacity to support Ukraine</a>, increase internal tensions, and strain emergency resources.</p><h3 id="russian-sabotage-activities-escalate-amid-fraught-tensions">Russian Sabotage Activities Escalate Amid Fraught Tensions</h3><p>As tensions between Russia and NATO remain high, Russia is very likely expanding its sabotage operations across Europe, with a focus on undermining NATOs support for Ukraine. These covert activities align with Russias broader hybrid warfare strategy, aiming to destabilize NATO countries, weaken their military capabilities, and strain political alliances. Recent incidents analyzed by Insikt Group reveal the calculated and persistent nature of Russian sabotage, using covert operatives, agent networks, and plausible deniability to avoid direct attribution.</p><h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2><p>Since <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/executive-overview-of-russian-aggression-against-ukraine">Russias invasion of Ukraine in 2022</a>, European governments have increasingly reported suspected sabotage activities linked to Russia. This gray zone warfare includes operations that damage critical infrastructure without escalating to open conflict. Russia perceives itself as being in a passive phase of war with NATO countries due to their military support for Ukraine, thus justifying these low-profile but effective actions as part of a broader strategy to weaken adversaries.</p><h3 id="recent-incidents-of-sabotage">Recent Incidents of Sabotage</h3><p>In June 2024, Insikt Group identified several incidents across six European countries bordering Russia that align with <a href="https://therecord.media/alarm-over-russia-sabotage-europe-spreads">Russian sabotage tactics</a>:</p><ul><li><strong>Finland:</strong> Break-ins at water treatment facilities were reported, raising concerns about potential contamination and public safety risks. These breaches are indicative of economic sabotage targeting essential resources.</li><li><strong>Poland:</strong> Explosions at the Mesko arms factory and fires at the Broad Gauge Metallurgy Line transshipment terminal caused significant disruptions. Given the strategic importance of these facilities in supplying arms to Ukraine, these incidents are likely intended to hinder NATOs logistical support to Ukraine.</li><li><strong>Norway:</strong> Multiple arson attacks on vehicles and fires at critical transport hubs have disrupted infrastructure, increasing operational strain on local authorities.</li></ul><p>These incidents exemplify Russias likely objectives: to degrade NATO&#39;s operational readiness, overwhelm emergency response systems, and create an atmosphere of insecurity among European populations.</p><h3 id="russian-sabotage-tactics">Russian Sabotage Tactics</h3><p>Russian sabotage activities rely on techniques that ensure plausible deniability. Intelligence networks recruit agents, often disaffected individuals or groups, who can execute these operations without drawing direct links to the Russian state. For example, covert operatives may infiltrate target nations under civilian covers, such as tourists or diplomats, or recruit local agents to avoid suspicion.</p><p>Russian sabotage tactics can be categorized into three groups:</p><ul><li><strong>Economic sabotage</strong>: Targeting infrastructure essential to economic stability, such as water treatment facilities and supply chains</li><li><strong>Military sabotage</strong>: Disrupting arms production, transportation, and military readiness through attacks on weapons factories or logistics hubs</li><li><strong>Political destabilization</strong>: Amplifying socio-political divisions and instilling fear within local populations by creating a persistent threat of sabotage</li></ul><h3 id="legacy-of-soviet-era-sabotage-strategies">Legacy of Soviet-Era Sabotage Strategies</h3><p>Russian sabotage objectives today are largely consistent with Soviet-era strategies, as detailed by defector accounts and declassified documents. The Soviet Union frequently deployed covert operatives to weaken adversaries before and during conflicts. Today, Russian operatives continue to use cover identities, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2021-0909.pdf">recruit agents</a>, and employ rudimentary means (like arson or improvised explosives) to maintain plausible deniability. This continuity highlights the enduring influence of Soviet military doctrines in Russias current approach to hybrid warfare.</p><h3 id="mitigations">Mitigations</h3><p>To counter the growing threat of Russian sabotage, NATO and its member states should strengthen infrastructure security and improve intelligence-sharing mechanisms across borders. Key steps include:</p><ul><li>Use Recorded Future Intelligence Clouds <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/geopolitical-intelligence">Facility Risk</a> feature to monitor notable events occurring in close proximity to critical infrastructure facilities.</li><li>Use the <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform/intelligence-cloud">Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud</a> to track potential Russian sabotage events and monitor commonly used tactics.</li><li>Enhance national and local counterintelligence, surveillance, and physical security monitoring measures around critical infrastructure, such as those identified in previously documented Russian sabotage operations.</li><li>Increase cooperation and intelligence-sharing among European nations on Russian sabotage activities and collaborate on identifying transnational Russian agent networks.</li><li>Monitor for signs of escalating Russian hybrid activities, such as sudden upticks in unexplained accidents or environmental incidents, and communicate risks to relevant businesses and industries.</li></ul><h2 id="outlook">Outlook</h2><p>Russias sabotage activities are unlikely to wane as tensions with NATO continue. As hybrid warfare evolves, so too will Russian tactics, with an increased emphasis on leveraging emerging technologies and maintaining deniability. The stakes for European security are high; Russian sabotage has the potential to not only disrupt essential services but also create political instability and weaken public trust in governments ability to protect their citizens.</p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/ta-ru-2024-1114.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Recorded Futures Insikt Group discovered that the attackers embedded malicious JavaScript in these sites, which spoofed a TLS certificate error to trick visitors into downloading a disguised security certificate. This malware, often used by threat actors for remote access and post-exploitation, highlights a continued cyber-espionage focus on Tibetan entities. TAG-112s infrastructure, concealed using Cloudflare, links this campaign to other China-sponsored operations, particularly TAG-102 (Evasive Panda).</p><hr><h2 id="china-based-tag-112-compromises-tibetan-websites-to-distribute-cobalt-strike">China-Based TAG-112 Compromises Tibetan Websites to Distribute Cobalt Strike</h2><p>Cyberattacks targeting ethnic and religious minority groups in China continue, with new developments pointing to a targeted campaign against Tibetan organizations. In a recent investigation, Recorded Futures Insikt Group discovered a Chinese state-sponsored threat actor group, designated TAG-112, responsible for compromising Tibetan community websites and delivering Cobalt Strike, a potent cyber-espionage tool.</p><h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2><p>In late May 2024, TAG-112 compromised at least two Tibetan community websites: Tibet Post (tibetpost[.]net) and Gyudmed Tantric University (gyudmedtantricuniversity[.]org). The attackers exploited vulnerabilities in the Joomla content management system (CMS) used by these sites to implant malicious JavaScript. This JavaScript prompted visitors to download a fake security certificate, which, when opened, deployed the Cobalt Strike payload.</p><p>TAG-112s infrastructure shows notable overlap with TAG-102 (<a href="https://therecord.media/china-based-hackers-evasive-isps-malware">Evasive Panda</a>), a more sophisticated Chinese state-sponsored group known for targeting Tibetan entities. However, Insikt Group has identified TAG-112 as a separate entity due to differences in attack maturity and tactics, such as using Cobalt Strike rather than custom malware and foregoing JavaScript obfuscation.</p><h3 id="malicious-javascript-and-spoofed-tls-error">Malicious JavaScript and Spoofed TLS Error</h3><p>The attack begins with the malicious JavaScript embedded in the compromised websites. When a user visits one of these sites, the script detects the operating system and browser type, confirming compatibility with Windows. If compatible, the script initiates a connection with TAG-112s command-and-control (C2) domain, update[.]maskrisks[.]com, which then returns an HTML page spoofing a legitimate TLS certificate error.</p><p>This spoofed error page is crafted to mimic Google Chromes TLS certificate warning, deceiving users into clicking a link to &quot;download a security certificate.&quot; Upon clicking, users unknowingly initiate the download of <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/detect-cobalt-strike-inside-look">Cobalt Strike</a>, a legitimate tool commonly used by security testers but often exploited by attackers for remote access and command execution.</p><h3 id="exploiting-website-vulnerabilities">Exploiting Website Vulnerabilities</h3><p>TAG-112 likely gained access to the compromised Tibetan websites through vulnerabilities in Joomla, a popular CMS. Websites built on Joomla are frequently targeted by attackers if they are not adequately maintained and updated. Likely by exploiting these weaknesses, TAG-112 was able to upload the malicious JavaScript file, which remains active on these sites as of early October 2024.</p><h3 id="infrastructure-and-obfuscation-tactics">Infrastructure and Obfuscation Tactics</h3><p>TAG-112s infrastructure shows a level of sophistication in concealing its origins. The group used Cloudflare to shield its servers&#39; IP addresses, complicating efforts to trace the infrastructure back to its origin. Insikt Group identified multiple IP addresses linked to TAG-112s C2 servers, some active as early as March 2024. The primary domain, maskrisks[.]com, was registered in March 2024 through Namecheap, with subdomains such as mail[.]maskrisks[.]com and checkupdate[.]maskrisks[.]com added for further operational flexibility.</p><h3 id="tag-112s-use-of-cobalt-strike">TAG-112s Use of Cobalt Strike</h3><p>Cobalt Strike is a commercial penetration testing tool that has become a favorite among threat actors due to its versatility and powerful capabilities for remote access, lateral movement, and command-and-control. Insikt Group identified six distinct Cobalt Strike Beacon samples linked to TAG-112, with their C2 communication directed to mail[.]maskrisks[.]com. This malware enables TAG-112 to monitor and control compromised systems, gathering intelligence and potentially leveraging these infected systems for further espionage activities.</p><h3 id="connections-to-tag-102-evasive-panda">Connections to TAG-102 (Evasive Panda)</h3><p>TAG-112 shares several operational characteristics with TAG-102 (Evasive Panda), another <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/chinese-cyberespionage-operations">Chinese APT known for targeting the Tibetan community</a>. Both groups have used similar methods, including spoofed error pages to deliver malicious files. However, TAG-112s operations are less sophisticated than TAG-102, indicating that it may be a subgroup or less experienced branch. For instance, while TAG-102 has deployed customized malware and used obfuscation techniques, TAG-112 relies on the readily available Cobalt Strike tool without obfuscating its JavaScript.</p><p>Despite the lack of obfuscation, TAG-112s tactics and overlaps with TAG-102 highlight the Chinese governments ongoing interest in Tibetan and other ethnic and religious minority communities. Such campaigns are part of a broader strategy of surveillance and control, targeting groups perceived as threats to the stability and control of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).</p><h3 id="mitigation-recommendations">Mitigation Recommendations</h3><p>TAG-112s campaign underscores the importance of proactive cybersecurity measures, particularly for organizations that may be high-value targets for state-sponsored actors. Recorded Future recommends the following steps:</p><ol><li><strong>Intrusion Detection and Prevention</strong>: Configure intrusion detection (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to alert on any indicators of compromise (IoCs) associated with TAG-112. Consider blocking connections to known TAG-112 infrastructure after a thorough review.</li><li><strong>User Training</strong>: Educate users to exercise caution when handling files downloaded from untrusted sources. Advise users against opening files that download automatically without input, as these could be part of phishing or drive-by download attacks.</li><li><strong>Cobalt Strike Detection</strong>: Enable real-time monitoring for malicious Cobalt Strike C2 servers using threat intelligence modules such as Recorded Futures Intelligence Cloud.</li><li><strong>Network Monitoring</strong>: Regularly monitor network traffic for signs of compromise, particularly for connections to known threat infrastructure. Malicious Traffic Analysis (MTA) can help detect unusual activity, alerting security teams to potential C2 communications.</li></ol><h2 id="outlook">Outlook</h2><p>TAG-112s operations against Tibetan organizations reflect a longstanding objective within <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/charting-chinas-climb-leading-global-cyber-power">Chinese cyber-espionage</a> campaigns to monitor and control ethnic and religious minorities, especially those seen as potentially destabilizing. Other groups and regions with similar CCP-designated risk profiles are likely targets of similar state-sponsored attacks.</p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-cn-2024-1112.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p><h2>Appendix A  Indicators of Compromise</h2><table><tbody><tr><td style="font-family:Courier New;background-color:#ffffff;"><strong>Compromised Websites:</strong><br>tibetpost[.]net<br>gyudmedtantricuniversity[.]org<br><br><strong>C2 Domains:</strong><br>maskrisks[.]com<br>mail[.]maskrisks[.]com<br>update[.]maskrisks[.]com<br>checkupdate[.]maskrisks[.]com<br><br><br><strong>C2 IP Addresses:</strong><br>154.90.62[.]12<br>154.90.63[.]166<br>154.205.138[.]202<br><br><strong>Certificates:</strong><br>d0972247c500d2a45f412f9434287161de395a35ef5b4931cba12cf513b76962(*[.]dnspod[.]cn)<br>94569f64f62eff185ba47e991dba54bdeea6d1a9e205d6bec767be6a864e4efb (Cloudflare Origin *.maskrisks[.]com)<br>d4938cb5c031ec7f04d73d4e75f5db5c8a5c04ce (Stolen code-signing certificate KP MOBILE)<br><br><strong>URLs of malicious JavaScript:</strong><br>https[:]//gyudmedtantricuniversity[.]org/templates/lt_interiordesign/js/custom.js<br>https[:]//tibetpost[.]net/templates/ja_teline_v/js/gallery/jquery.blueimp-gallery.full.js<br><br><strong>Malicious URLs:</strong><br>https[:]//update[.]maskrisks[.]com/download <br>https[:]//update[.]maskrisks[.]com/?type=Chrome<br>https[:]//update[.]maskrisks[.]com/?type=Edge<br>http[:]//mail[.]maskrisks[.]com/api/view.php<br>http[:]//154.205.138[.]202/GetUrl/cache<br>https[:]//checkupdate[.]maskrisks[.]com/cache<br>https[:]//update[.]maskrisks[.]com/cache<br><br><strong>Cobalt Strike:</strong><br>1e42cbe23055e921eff46e5e6921ff1a20bb903fca83ea1f1294394c0df3f4cd<br>0e306c0836a8ee035ae739c5adfbe42bd5021e615ebaa92f52d5d86fb895651d<br>f1f11e52a60e5a446f1eb17bb718358def4825342acc0a41d09a051359a1eb3d<br>f4ded3a67480a0e2a822af1e87a727243dea16ac1a3c0513aec62bff71f06b27<br>966d311dcc598922e4ab9ce5524110a8bfd2c6b6db540d180829ceb7a7253831<br>1e7cb19f77206317c8828f9c3cdee76f2f0ebf7451a625641f7d22bb8c61b21b<br><br><strong>Loaders:</strong><br>8d4049ef70c83a6ead26736c1330e2783bdc9708c497183317fad66b818e44cb<br>E190c7e097a1c38dd45d9c149e737ad9253b1cabee1cee7ef080ddf52d1b378c (legitimate software)<br>31f11b4d81f3ae25b6a01cd1038914f31d045bc4136c40a6221944ea553d6414<br><br></td></tr></tbody></table>            <p><br><br></p><h2>Appendix B  Mitre ATT&CK Techniques</h2><table style="background-color:#ffffff;"><tr><td style="background-color:#0071CE;color:#ffffff;font-weight: 700;"><strong>Tactic: Technique</strong></td><td style="background-color:#0071CE;color:#ffffff;font-weight: 700;"><strong>ATT&CK Code</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Resource Development:</strong> Acquire Infrastructure: Server</td><td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/004/" rel="nofollow noopener">T1583.004</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Resource Development:</strong> Acquire Infrastructure: Web Services</td><td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/006/" rel="nofollow noopener">T1583.006</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Resource Development:</strong> Compromise Infrastructure: Server</td><td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584/004/" rel="nofollow noopener">T1584.004</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Initial Access:</strong> Drive-by Compromise</td><td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189/" rel="nofollow noopener">T1189</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Defense Evasion:</strong> Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Side-Loading</td><td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002/" rel="nofollow noopener">T1574.002</a></td></tr></table>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Increasingly, attackers don&#39;t hack in anymorethey log in. As enterprises rapidly adopt cloud-based SaaS applications, our security landscape has fundamentally shifted. Identity, not infrastructure, has become the primary target.</p><h2 id="why-identity-is-the-new-battlefield">Why Identity Is the New Battlefield</h2><p>To understand the scale of this identity crisis, let&#39;s look at the data:</p><ul><li>In 2024, credential-based attacks remain the leading cause of data breaches, responsible for <a href="https://blog.1password.com/verizon-data-breach-report-2024-analysis/#:~:text=in%202024%2C%20the%20overwhelming%20majority%20of%20data%20breaches%20can%20still%20be%20traced%20to%20credential%2Dbased%20attacks%20and%20human%20error.">~38% of incidents</a>, significantly outpacing phishing (~17%) and exploits (~16%).

This is a problem because cloud-based apps often have limited security visibility, a growing risk as organizations now use an average of <a href="https://backlinko.com/saas-statistics#:~:text=Organizations%20now%20use%20an%20average%20of%20112%20SaaS%20applications%2C%20up%20from%2016%20in%202017">112 SaaS appsup from just 16 in 2017</a>.</li><li><a href="https://blog.1password.com/verizon-data-breach-report-2024-analysis/#:~:text=use%20of%20stolen%20credentials%E2%80%9D%20is%20the%20number%20one%20initial%20action%20during%20breaches%2C%20and%20stolen%20credentials%20also%20account%20for%20a%20whopping%2077%25%20of%20Basic%20Web%20Application%20Attacks">77%</a> of SaaS application attacks (a subset of web app attacks) begin with stolen credentials.</li></ul><p>This focus on identity-based attacks is amplified by two emerging trends:</p><ol><li>The Rise of Shadow Identities: Employee-driven SaaS adoption has outpaced IT oversight, resulting in unmonitored accounts across organizations.

When employees sign up with basic credentials before IT can establish proper identity management, it can create a dangerous scenario called &quot;<a href="https://github.com/pushsecurity/saas-attacks/blob/main/techniques/ghost_logins/description.md">Ghost Login</a>&quot;where accounts become susceptible to takeover through dual authentication paths.</li></ol><h2 id="the-snowflake-incident-a-warning-sign">The Snowflake Incident: A Warning Sign</h2><p>To understand how these identity vulnerabilities play out in real-world scenarios, we can look at the recent <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/unc5537-snowflake-data-theft-extortion">incident</a> involving a cloud software provider. This incident, which led to millions of records in data exposure for 165 organizations, exposed a dangerous intersection of vulnerabilities that could threaten many SaaS platforms. The attackers exploited three critical weaknesses that exist across today&#39;s SaaS landscape, one of which aligns with Ghost Logins:</p><ul><li>Compromised credentials<a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/unc5537-snowflake-data-theft-extortion#:~:text=Mandiant%20identified%20that%20the%20majority%20of%20the%20credentials%20used%20by%20UNC5537%20were%20available%20from%20historical%20infostealer%20infections%2C%20some%20of%20which%20dated%20as%20far%20back%20as%202020.">some dating back to breaches from 2020</a>.</li><li>Weak or absent MFA: Some victims were susceptible to Ghost Login attacks due to the availability of multiple authentication avenues. </li><li>Widespread application adoption.</li></ul><p>This recipe for compromise is particularly troubling because these three elements are present in so many SaaS applications today.

            <description><![CDATA[Explore Russia’s strategic information attack (SIA) concept, blending psychological and cyber tactics to target critical infrastructure in large-scale warfare.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png"></p><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>Russias Strategic Information Attack (SIA) concept focuses on non-kinetic methods to disrupt or destroy adversary national critical infrastructure (NCI) during strategic conflicts. Insikt Group acknowledges that SIA is not an official term used in Russian or Western defense parlance. Based on Russian doctrine, SIAs target adversaries through &quot;psychological attacks&quot; (influence operations) and &quot;technical attacks&quot; (cyberattacks) to exact strategic damage. While SIA is almost certainly reserved for large-scale war scenarios, it shares similarities with lower-intensity cyber and information attacks already observed in Western countries, such as targets. The goal of SIA is to employ strategic non-kinetic capabilities to escalate the conflict and force adversaries into negotiations on Moscows terms by causing significant infrastructure disruptions  aligned with Russias escalate to de-escalate conflict escalation management strategy. </p><h2 id="russian-strategic-information-attack-for-catastrophic-effect">Russian Strategic Information Attack for Catastrophic Effect</h2><p>Non-kinetic warfare is emerging and evolving as a significant threat. One such tool in Russias arsenal is the SIA, a concept that blends psychological and technical tactics to disrupt and destabilize adversaries&#39; NCI. This Insikt Group report dives into the mechanics of Russias SIA, the strategy, doctrine, and policies that frame it, its potential targets, and why Western organizations must be vigilant.</p><h3 id="the-concept-of-sia">The Concept of SIA</h3><p>Russias SIA concept involves employing non-kinetic methods, such as psychological attacks (influence operations) and technical attacks (cyberattacks), to damage or destroy NCI. This tactic is anchored, in concept, to Russias perception of how the United States historically used nuclear weapons in WWII to escalate the use of military means to compel its adversary to accept peace negotiations (de-escalation). The primary goal is to exact catastrophic damage to the adversary and weaken the enemys ability to sustain conflict, leading to negotiations that favor Russias terms.</p><p>In Russian doctrine, SIAs are framed by the Kremlins information confrontation strategy, which includes efforts to <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/russia-linked-copycop-uses-llms-to-weaponize-influence-content-at-scale">manipulate information systems</a> and the publics perception. These attacks aim to undermine the target countrys political stability and NCI. Russia&#39;s view on information warfare treats cyberspace as both a battleground and a domain for strategic advantage.</p><h3 id="psychological-attacks-in-sia">Psychological Attacks in SIA</h3><p>Psychological attacks focus on shaping adversaries&#39; perceptions and eroding trust in their leadership and institutions. By disseminating true and false information or exploiting existing societal tensions, Russia seeks to create widespread chaos and unrest. In times of heightened conflict, these attacks can drive public panic, leading to political instability. For instance, Russian defense analysts propose the malicious use of artificial intelligence (MUAI) could lead to <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/deepfakes-id-verification">deepfake videos</a> impersonating key leaders, further exacerbating societal concerns or divisions.</p><p>Historically, Russia has demonstrated expertise in influence operations. Soviet-era active measures aimed at <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/russian-information-operations-divide-western-coalition-ukraine">destabilizing Western countries</a> are now updated with modern techniques, including the use of AI-generated content. Russian military theorists have outlined scenarios in which information could cause societal collapse, with analysts predicting that such tactics could be used to provoke a second Civil War in the United States.</p><h3 id="technical-attacks-in-sia">Technical Attacks in SIA</h3><p>On the technical side, SIA encompasses sophisticated cyberattacks designed to disrupt or destroy NCI. These attacks could target communication systems, power grids, financial infrastructure, or government networks. In contrast to typical cyberattacks, which might cause short-term damage, strategic cyberattacks aim for long-lasting, widespread effects.</p><p>During <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/themes-failures-russias-war-against-ukraine">Russias war in Ukraine</a>  which is not characterized as a large-scale war in Russias official military doctrine , <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/dark-covenant-2-cybercrime-russian-state-war-ukraine">cyberattacks were a major component of the Kremlins strategy</a>. However, these attacks were focused on specific tactical objectives, rather than full-scale strategic destruction. If Russia were to initiate an SIA during a large-scale war, it would almost certainly be aimed at critical infrastructure that directly supports both civilian and military operations, causing significant damage and forcing the adversary to acquiesce to Moscows demands.</p><h3 id="strategic-targets-soviet-era-and-modern-targeting-methodologies">Strategic Targets: Soviet-era and Modern Targeting Methodologies</h3><p>To frame Russian SIA, Insikt Group cited Soviet-era and modern Russian targeting concepts. Defector Viktor Suvorov revealed a model that divided critical infrastructure into categories such as the brain (national leadership), nervous system (national communications), heart and blood supply (national energy infrastructure), and teeth (nuclear weapons capabilities). While this model primarily applied to kinetic operations, it aligns with Russias modern cyber capabilities, where attacks could focus on these same vital systems.</p><p>Russias doctrine of escalate to de-escalate refers to the use of efforts to force an adversary to negotiate. This strategy is typically associated with Russias nuclear arsenal but applies equally to strategic cyber capabilities. By launching an SIA against NCI, Russia seeks to create enough pressure on adversary governments to achieve its geopolitical objectives without resorting to strategic kinetic means  such as mass conventional or nuclear weapons strikes.</p><p>Russias modern military doctrine, Strategic Operations for the Destruction of Critically Important Targets (SODCIT), outlines a similar approach for targeting NCI in a way that limits civilian casualties while exerting pressure on national governments. The intent is to force adversaries into negotiations by threatening critical infrastructure without causing mass casualties.</p><p>The dual approach of psychological and technical attacks allows Russia to customize its targeting. In some cases, <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/russian-and-iranian-influence-networks-target-french-elections">psychological attacks alonesuch as influence operations</a>are intended to erode trust and create enough chaos to disrupt governance. In other cases, technical attacks target an adversarys ability to communicate or distribute power. Psychological and technical attacks can also have overlapping effects, such as influence operations that undermine faith and confidence in the financial sector that coincide with technical attacks against financial networks. </p><h3 id="outlook">Outlook</h3><p>Western countries, particularly those managing critical infrastructure, must prepare for potential Russian SIAs. The risks posed by these attacks are substantial, but public and private entities can take steps to mitigate them. </p><p>Organizations need to improve cybersecurity defenses, including monitoring for signs of psychological attacks. Collaboration between governments, private enterprises, and cybersecurity experts will be crucial in identifying and mitigating these threats. Exercises and simulations, such as red teaming, can help organizations test their readiness for potential attacks. Industry leaders must consider incorporating scenarios that mirror Russias SIAs to strengthen defenses and identify vulnerabilities.</p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/ta-ru-2024-1024.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png"></p><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>Operation Overload, a Russia-aligned influence operation, is aggressively targeting the 2024 US presidential election. Using fake news, fact-checking sites, and AI-generated audio, it seeks to manipulate public opinion by impersonating trusted media organizations. This campaign primarily targets media outlets, fact-checkers, and researchers, aiming to overwhelm investigative resources and insert false narratives into mainstream discourse, but also directly targets the general public. Operation Overload previously attempted to <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/russian-and-iranian-influence-networks-target-french-elections">undermine the 2024 French elections</a> and the <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/hurdling-over-hazards-multifaceted-threats-to-the-2024-paris-olympics">Paris Olympics</a>, although with minimal success. Its goal now is to undermine trust in the US election process, exploit divisive social issues, stoke fears of political violence, and target candidates, particularly Vice President Kamala Harris.</p><h2 id="operation-overload-impersonates-media-to-influence-us-election">Operation Overload Impersonates Media to Influence US Election</h2><p>Operation Overload, also known as Matryoshka and Storm-1679, is a sophisticated Russia-aligned influence campaign designed to manipulate public opinion and sow discord. Previously attempting to undermine the 2024 French elections and the Paris Olympics, the operation is now shifting its focus to the 2024 US presidential election. It involves creating fake news sites, false fact-checking resources, and AI-generated audio that mimics legitimate media outlets. By impersonating trusted news organizations, the operation seeks to establish credibility to influence its targets more effectively.</p><h3 id="key-tactics-and-techniques">Key Tactics and Techniques</h3><ol><li><strong>Impersonation of Trusted Media Brands:</strong> Operation Overload relies heavily on impersonating reputable news outlets to lend credibility to its influence operations. By copying logos, using similar fonts and layouts, and falsely attributing content to real journalists, <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/russia-linked-copycop-uses-llms-to-weaponize-influence-content-at-scale">it creates content that appears legitimate</a>. This includes recycling video and image materials from publicly available sources and generating professional-sounding AI-generated voiceovers.</li><li><strong>AI-Generated Content:</strong> One of the newer developments in Operation Overload&#39;s toolkit is the use of AI to generate realistic voiceovers. This content, often used in short videos, further amplifies its perceived credibility and makes it more challenging to differentiate between legitimate and fake information.</li><li><strong>Targeting of Media and Fact-Checking Organizations:</strong> Operation Overload directs much of its focus toward media organizations, fact-checkers, and researchers. By flooding them with spam-like requests and fake fact-checking leads, the operation seeks to overwhelm their resources. This makes it harder for them to debunk Russian disinformation and risks them inadvertently reporting on false content, thereby injecting Russian malign narratives into mainstream political discourse.</li><li><strong>Amplification Through Automated Social Media:</strong> The operation also utilizes automated bots to spread its influence content on social media. This tactic, referred to as coordinated inauthentic behavior (CIB), helps amplify false narratives on social media platforms, making the content more widespread and visible to the general public.</li></ol><h3 id="the-role-of-ai-in-operation-overload">The Role of AI in Operation Overload</h3><p>One of the newer developments of Operation Overload is its reliance on AI-generated audio. <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/adversarial-intelligence-red-teaming-malicious-use-cases-ai">AI is being used to create voiceovers and make fake media content</a> appear to be from legitimate media outlets. This allows for the rapid production of high-quality disinformation at scale, making it more challenging to detect and debunk.</p><h3 id="impacts-on-the-2024-us-election">Impacts on the 2024 US Election</h3><p>The operation&#39;s primary goal is to overwhelm journalists and fact-checkers with persistent, spam-like requests to verify the operations inauthentic content, diverting resources from pursuing legitimate investigations and debunking Russian disinformation. The operation also hopes to use media organizations as a means of information laundering, more specifically, to inject malign content and pro-Kremlin narratives into mainstream political discourse via trusted parties. Finally, the operation seeks to directly inject influence content into mainstream discussion of contentious political issues, eroding public trust in the democratic process, provoking US domestic concerns of political violence and civil war, and exploiting existing social divisions.</p><p>Some of the narratives pushed by Operation Overload include:</p><ul><li><strong>Stoking Fears of Political Violence:</strong> By amplifying concerns about civil unrest and even civil war, the operation seeks to provoke fear and uncertainty.</li><li><strong>Targeting Candidates:</strong> Vice President Harris, in particular, is a major target of the operation&#39;s disinformation efforts.

            <description><![CDATA[How Complexity Influences Security Outcomes in a Volatile World]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Editor&#39;s note: The following blog post originally appeared on <a href="https://intelligence2risk.substack.com/">Levi Gundert&#39;s Substack page</a>.</strong></em></p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/0236694f_85c8_4620_992b_87418c1e77af_1024x1024_50f79706bb.webp" alt="0236694f-85c8-4620-992b-87418c1e77af_1024x1024.webp"></p><p>Riz was <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/12/04/1216950808/rizz-oxford-word-of-the-year-swiftie">Oxfords 2023 word</a> of the year. For the uninitiated, riz roughly translates to charisma (if you have a young teenager at home, ask them for a definition of rizzler and enjoy the confused expression resulting from your breach of their world). However, in business, we should co-opt riz as shorthand for resilience, particularly for those in the security industry. Riz represents the ability to withstand attacks, minimize damage, and quickly recover, ensuring business continuity. In security, riz requires consuming intelligence, inspecting existing controls, and addressing identified gaps (where appropriate). </p><p>Complexity and resilience have a nuanced relationship  resilience often increases with complexity up to a point, but too much complexity erodes riz, making systems fragile and harder to defend. While simple solutions (following the <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/kiss-keep-it-simple-stupid-a-design-principle">KISS principle</a>) can lead to resilience, maximum resilience in security often lies somewhere in the middle of the complexity spectrum. </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/b5e9aedd_f725_4f5f_863c_5c6b87570a09_1432x854_1abe88dfa0.webp" alt="b5e9aedd-f725-4f5f-863c-5c6b87570a09_1432x854.webp"></p><p><em>This chart and subsequent charts were quickly produced by <a href="https://hex.tech/">hex.tech</a> using Python code generated from ChatGPT.</em></p><h2 id="real-world-examples-complexity-and-resilience-in-action">Real-World Examples: Complexity and Resilience in Action</h2><p>Two semi-recent events -  a global IT outage (low complexity) and an attempted assassination (high complexity) - offer an opportunity to dissect how these two themes - complexity and resilience - influence risk management and how we should assess solutions that maximize resilience. The challenge is riz measurement and how security professionals can have confidence that they have comprehensively reviewed risk scenarios. The <a href="https://youtu.be/XaoigWHOtBM?feature=shared">Cone of Plausibility</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/GFVKKTwkANY?feature=shared">PESTLE</a> are intelligence frameworks that provide scaffolding for scenario exploration, and help assess how complexity impacts resilience in different contexts.</p><p><strong>[1] Global IT Outages: Low-Complexity Scenarios</strong></p><p>When a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24201803/crowdstrike-microsoft-it-global-outage-airlines-banking">faulty EDR update triggered significant Windows malfunctions</a>, the pain was immediately felt, and the social media armchair pundits were quick to throw stones. However, these errors can happen anywhere; thats the frailty of human brains mixed with complex technology systems. </p><p>Instead of analyzing fault, smart organizations looked for new learnings. Of course, resilience against future scenarios was at the top of the conversation list. Its natural to consider expanding beyond a single point of failure (or vendor) for any function, security, or otherwise, but this is where scenarios and associated costs are helpful. </p><p>Recorded Futures CIO - Josh Jones - estimates that running multiple EDR products for a company of 1,000 employees likely creates somewhere in the ballpark of 15% more overhead - software maintenance, updates, knowledge bases, etc. For a large enterprise with 100K endpoints, 30% additional resources are likely required to maintain multiple EDR products across different segments of the endpoint population. Then, there are decisions about which business units (or which percentage of business units) should run a different EDR client. </p><p>The chart below approximates where a single EDR vendor scores in simplicity. The same concept could apply to any segment of a computing stack. The theory is that additional diversity in vendor relationships could partially mitigate a similar future operating system outage. Naturally, additional resilience may also result in greater complexity. </p><p>In security, organizations can measure resilience by recognizing solution complexity as an essential cost before investing resources. </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/3639d7c3_d5bd_48c6_ba73_5b178d1ad2ed_1382x822_142aacaa94.webp" alt="3639d7c3-d5bd-48c6-ba73-5b178d1ad2ed_1382x822.webp"></p><p><em>A visual approximation of an operational technology scenario with low complexity and resilience.</em></p><p><strong>[2] U.S. Secret Service (USSS) Physical Protection: High-Complexity Scenarios</strong></p><p>When the news of the failed assassination attempt of former President Trump (and the deaths of innocent bystanders) started lighting up peoples phones, friends and family were quick to text me, asking for an explanation related to how such a scenario was possible. </p><p>Drawing from my experience as a former U.S. Secret Service (USSS) Agent, I can provide some small insights into the complexity of protective operations. The USSS is a dual-mission agency, responsible for both protection and investigations. This dual mandate and limited resources create a complex operational environment. A comparison of <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2022-03/U.S.%20Secret%20Service_Remediated.pdf">USSS funding</a> and <a href="https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-03/fbi_fy_24_pb_bud_sum_ii_omb_cleared_3-08-23.pdf">FBI funding</a> highlights a significant resource gap (for context, USSS <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classification-qualifications/general-schedule-qualification-standards/1800/criminal-investigation-series-1811/">special agents</a> total ~4k compared to FBI special agents, who number ~14k). </p><p>Limited resources become detrimental given the demands of criminal investigations (e.g., <a href="https://www.secretservice.gov/newsroom/releases/2023/05/secret-service-state-department-offer-10-million-dollar-reward">fraud and cybercrime</a>), added to continuous protection mandates (<a href="https://www.britannica.com/list/secret-service-code-names-of-11-us-presidents">POTUS</a>, <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/272109285312">VPOTUS</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Former_Presidents_Act">former POTUSes</a>, <a href="https://www.etsy.com/ca/listing/1205067395/usss-dpd-us-secret-service-dignitary">visiting foreign dignitaries</a>, <a href="https://www.secretservice.gov/protection/events">national events</a>, etc.), which require significant capital and human assets. The USSS is successful in its mission because it excels at planning and logistics. The last resort, bodyguarding, generally only occurs due to suboptimal riz. Unlike digital systems downtime, which we <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/business/crowdstrike-microsoft-outage-corporate-workers.html">generally accept</a> happens, the risk tolerance for an adverse event in a protective mission is roughly zero. </p><p>This is where former POTUS Trumps Pennsylvania rally becomes relevant. To address agent staffing demands, the USSS regularly partners with local, state, and federal law enforcement to protect outer perimeters during events. In addition to boosting numbers, these partnerships bring additional expertise, such as in-depth knowledge of the local environment, high-risk tactical units (SWAT), canine handlers, <a href="https://www.clevelandtn.gov/275/SWAT-Explosive-Ordinance-Disposal-EOD-Tr">EOD experts</a>, etc., that benefit the protective mission. However, coordinating technology (e.g., communications) is one area where complexity becomes challenging. </p><p>A command post often has to relay communications between agencies that may use different equipment, encryption protocols, etc. This dynamic creates delays and, at the risk of speculation, may have contributed to the hesitation of USSS sniper teams attempting to assess the nature of a suspect on a roof where other agencies were actively working. </p><p>While USSS advance agents (for both trips and individual sites) are incredibly detail-oriented, even the pre-event briefings with combined agencies can create confusion, as there are different standard operating procedures (e.g., rules of engagement, arresting authority, etc.). The physical security environment becomes inherently more complex as additional agencies and departments are added to the mix. Too much complexity reduces riz. </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/b6099c50_702a_4452_a7f5_867ec18704e9_1410x840_7ec682f82b.webp" alt="b6099c50-702a-4452-a7f5-867ec18704e9_1410x840.webp"></p><p><em>A visual approximation of a physical security scenario with high complexity and lower resilience.</em></p><h2 id="using-the-tools-cone-of-plausibility-and-pestle">Using the Tools: Cone of Plausibility and PESTLE</h2><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/14152740_2a6f_435e_8fc5_df607f23c4f5_1024x1024_cbd553c302.webp" alt="14152740-2a6f-435e-8fc5-df607f23c4f5_1024x1024.webp"></p><p>Mental scaffolding helps create confidence in evaluating potential outcomesroutine events and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blackswan.asp">black swans</a>to ultimately assess trade-offs in complexity and resilience. In security, resilience cannot be measured solely by internal metrics. As complexity grows, so too does the need for structured thinking. This is where the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016328722000957">Cone of Plausibility</a> and <a href="https://www.lawcareers.net/Explore/LCNSays/Wrestle-with-PESTLE-cybersecurity-threats-in-the-digital-age">PESTLE</a> excel as frameworks, helping professionals make informed decisions that ultimately safeguard business continuity. </p><p>PESTLE (Political, Economic, Sociological, Technological, Legal, and Environmental) helps broaden the scope of analysis, ensuring that organizations dont just focus on internal factors but also account for the broader context that influences resilience.</p><p>The Cone of Plausibility is used to assess a range of future scenarios by staging different possible outcomes. <a href="https://www.secalliance.com/blog/applying-cone-of-plausibility-to-cti">SecAlliance has a helpful write-up</a> (with examples) on how PESTLE-M (+Military) feeds the cone in cyber threat intelligence (CTI). </p><p>The scenario designations wildcard, plausible, and baseline are helpful labels that decision-makers can consistently anticipate. Additionally, these scenarios lack conclusions, thus avoiding leading the witness and allowing consumers to formulate their own derivative risk implications.  </p><p>Western business implications from accelerating geopolitical tensions with China present an interesting cone exercise (twenty-year time horizon). Specifically, the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/08/american-water-largest-us-water-utility-cyberattack.html">cyber scenarios</a> involve potential solutions with significant trade-offs in complexity and resilience. </p><h2 id="risk-management">Risk Management</h2><p>There are no right answers in complexity/resilience trade-offs. Organizations need better processes to evaluate equities and soberly manage risks. Sometimes, the riz juice isnt worth the squeeze, but everyone should understand the choices. </p><p><em>A special thank you to Rosie Hampton, Dylan Davis, and Megan Keeling for a lovely walk and discussion of these topics.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png"></p><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>Rhysida ransomware, first active in early 2023, employs multi-tiered infrastructure and CleanUpLoader for post-exploitation activities. UsingRecorded Future&#39;s Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified Rhysida victims an average of 30 days before they appeared on public extortion sites, offering a critical window to prevent ransomware deployment and mitigate damage. The infrastructure includes typosquatted domains, SEO poisoning, and C2 infrastructure for post-exfiltration activities. CleanUpLoader, commonly disguised as a software installer, aids Rhysida in data exfiltration and persistence. Notably, Rhysida targets sectors like healthcare and education, and focuses on both Windows and Linux-based systems. </p><h2 id="rhysida-ransomware-crawls-into-systems-with-cleanuploader">Rhysida Ransomware Crawls into Systems with CleanUpLoader</h2><p>Sophisticated ransomware groups such as Rhysida are significantly impacting organizations globally. This group has been active since January 2023 and has continuously evolved its tactics. Leveraging CleanUpLoader for post-exploitation, Rhysida has been observed crawling into systems, with the ultimate objective of causing significant damage.</p><p>In this detailed analysis, we will delve into how Rhysida uses its multi-tiered infrastructure and CleanUpLoader to execute ransomware attacks and how Recorded Futures Network Intelligence has proven crucial in early detection.</p><h3 id="rhysidas-attack-strategy">Rhysidas Attack Strategy</h3><p>Like many modern ransomware groups, Rhysida uses a multi-tiered infrastructure to carry out its attacks. Insikt Groups latest analysis, supported by Recorded Futures Network Intelligence, reveals how Rhysida uses its infrastructure to execute the early phases of the attack.</p><p>By creating typosquatted domains resembling popular software download sites, Rhysida tricks users into downloading infected files. This technique is particularly effective when coupled with SEO poisoning, in which these domains are ranked higher in search engine results, making them appear as legitimate download sources. Once a user clicks on one of these malicious domains, they are redirected to a payload server hosting CleanUpLoader, which is then used by the attacker during the post-exploitation phase. </p><h3 id="cleanuploader">CleanUpLoader</h3><p>CleanUpLoader is a versatile backdoor malware used by Rhysida in its attack campaigns. This malware was primarily seen delivered as fake installers for popular software, such as Microsoft Teams and Google Chrome, making it more likely that targets unknowingly install it. CleanUpLoader not only facilitates persistence but also enables Rhysida actors to exfiltrate valuable data before ransomware deployment.</p><p>With multiple C2 domains built into its configuration, CleanUpLoader ensures redundancy, allowing it to maintain operations even if one C2 server is taken offline. The backdoor communicates with its command-and-control (C2) servers via HTTPS.</p><h3 id="rhysidas-victim-profile">Rhysidas Victim Profile</h3><p>Rhysidas ransomware operations are global and affect a wide range of sectors, with the government and public sector being prime targets. These sectors have been particularly vulnerable due to their highly sensitive data and often insufficient security measures.</p><p>High-profile breaches include the attack on King Edward VIIs Hospital in London in 2023, where Rhysida claimed to have stolen sensitive information from hospital staff and patients, including members of the British royal family. Additionally, attacks on the Chilean Army and the City of Columbus demonstrate Rhysidas ability to infiltrate critical public sector infrastructures.</p><p>One of the group&#39;s distinguishing traits is its willingness to attack sectors that were previously off-limits for ransomware groups, including schools and hospitals. This represents a significant shift in ransomware ethics, signaling a more ruthless approach from modern threat actors.</p><h3 id="recorded-futures-early-detection">Recorded Futures Early Detection</h3><p>Recorded Futures Network Intelligence&#39;s early detection capabilities have proven to be a game-changer in combating ransomware. Insikt Group identified that Rhysida victims could be detected on average 30 days before appearing on public extortion sites. Monitoring Rhysidas infrastructure, including typosquatting domains and CleanUpLoader C2 servers, made this detection possible.</p><p>The average dwell time between initial infection and ransomware deployment offers defenders a critical window to respond.

Recent Insikt Group research highlights 82 deepfakes targeting public figures in 38 countries between July 2023 and July 2024. Deepfakes aimed at financial gain, election manipulation, character assassination, and spreading non-consensual pornography are on the rise. To counter these risks, organizations must act swiftly, increase awareness, and implement advanced AI detection tools.</p><h2 id="2024-deepfakes-and-political-disinformation-emerging-threats--mitigation-strategies">2024 Deepfakes and Political Disinformation: Emerging Threats &amp; Mitigation Strategies</h2><p>The proliferation of <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/deepfakes-id-verification">AI-generated deepfakes</a> is reshaping the political and <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/russia-linked-copycop-uses-llms-to-weaponize-influence-content-at-scale">disinformation landscape</a>. Between July 2023 and July 2024, deepfakes impersonating public figures surfaced in 38 countries, raising concerns about election interference, character defamation, and more. Heres a detailed breakdown of these emerging threats and strategies to mitigate them.</p><h2 id="key-trends-in-deepfake-use">Key Trends in Deepfake Use</h2><p>82 deepfakes were identified in 38 countries, with 30 nations holding elections during the dataset timeframe or having elections planned for 2024. Political figures, heads of state, candidates, and journalists were targeted, amplifying the potential to disrupt democratic processes.</p><h2 id="primary-objectives">Primary Objectives</h2><p><strong>Scams (26.8%):</strong> <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/deepfakes-frauds-next-frontier">Deepfakes</a> are frequently used to promote financial scams, leveraging heightened attention during elections. Prominent figures like Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President-Elect Claudia Sheinbaum were impersonated in fraudulent schemes.</p><p><strong>False Statements (25.6%):</strong> Deepfakes often fabricate public figures statements to mislead voters. For instance, fake audios emerged of UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer criticizing his own party, and Taiwans Ko Wen-Je making false accusations.</p><p><strong>Electioneering (15.8%):</strong> Political parties increasingly use deepfakes to influence voter behavior. Turkeys President Erdoan used a deepfake to link an opposition leader to terrorist groups, while Argentina saw deepfakes in the Milei vs. Massa election battle.</p><p><strong>Character Assassination (10.9%):</strong> Figures like Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. have been depicted engaging in unethical behavior, eroding public trust.</p><p><strong>Non-consensual Pornography (10.9%):</strong> Women in politics are disproportionately targeted with deepfake pornography, creating reputational damage and deterring political participation.</p><h2 id="emerging-deepfake-tactics">Emerging Deepfake Tactics</h2><p>Several new tactics have emerged, demonstrating how sophisticated deepfake operations have become:</p><ul><li><strong>Fake Whistleblowers:</strong> Using AI to create deepfakes of third-parties posing as whistleblowers, influence actors seek to manipulate public opinion by fabricating scandals.</li><li><strong>Audio Deepfakes:</strong> A growing trend is the use of fake audio clips to create false statements, like President Biden allegedly urging voters to skip primaries.</li><li>Spoofing Media Assets: Influence actors increasingly use legitimate news branding, such as logos or overlays from France24 and BBC, to give their deepfakes credibility.</li><li>Foreign Leader Impersonation: Videos like those featuring Chinas Xi Jinping or the US&#39;s Donald Trump have been repurposed to influence domestic elections in Taiwan and South Africa, respectively.</li><li>Family Member Impersonation: Deepfakes are even targeting family members of political figures, adding another layer of disinformation and manipulation.</li></ul><h2 id="the-impact-of-deepfakes-on-elections">The Impact of Deepfakes on Elections</h2><p><a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/aggressive-malign-influence-threatens-us-2024-elections">Deepfakes have become a tool in political warfare</a>. In Slovakia, for example, a deepfake audio emerged just before elections, spreading disinformation about electoral fraud, while Turkey saw a candidate withdraw from its presidential race after the release of an alleged deepfake sex tape.The disinformation potential of deepfakes, especially in volatile political climates, is vast. The risk of discrediting political candidates and spreading false narratives makes the need for advanced countermeasures more urgent.</p><h2 id="countering-the-deepfake-threat">Countering the Deepfake Threat</h2><ul><li><strong>Speed and Accuracy:</strong> When deepfakes go viral, its essential to act quickly. Public figures should release authentic content to debunk false claims swiftly.</li><li><strong>Familiarity Campaigns:</strong> Encourage public figures to increase their visibility, allowing people to become familiar with their true likenesses.</li><li><strong>Copyright Leverage:</strong> Deepfakes that use copyrighted materials can be taken down via DMCA requests, providing a possible legal avenue to counter AI-generated disinformation.</li><li><strong>Advanced AI Detection:</strong> Governments and media outlets need to invest in AI-powered detection tools to identify and take down deepfakes before they cause significant harm.</li><li><strong>Collaboration with Fact-Checkers:</strong> Collaboration between social media platforms and fact-checking organizations will be essential in curbing the spread of deepfakes and false narratives.</li></ul><p>Deepfakes will likely play a significant role in the 2024 US elections and global political processes, impacting outcomes by damaging reputations and eroding trust in elections. Regulations struggle to keep up with the evolving technology, especially in foreign interference and election manipulation. Research suggests that deepfakes, beyond a certain quality, don&#39;t necessarily need to be highly sophisticated to cause harm. Therefore, focusing on response and mitigation strategies is more effective, including exposing audiences to the real likeness of impersonated individuals and fact-checking narratives swiftly.</p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/ta-2024-0924.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Learn how DORA enhances operational resilience for financial institutions in the EU, focusing on ICT risk management, third-party oversight, and more.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Globally, regulations and directives are significantly altering the way organizations address cyber resilience, emphasizing the necessity for a more proactive stance. This is evident in both the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) and the second version of the Network and Information Systems Directive (NIS2).</p><h2 id="what-is-dora">What is DORA?</h2><p>DORA <a href="https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/digital-operational-resilience-act-dora_en">establishes</a> technical standards for EU member states to adopt as it relates to covered entities and their critical third-party Information &amp; Communications Technology (ICT) providers across EU member states. ICT is considered to be so influential and essential to economic development and business growth that it has been credited with ushering in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. However, this reliance on ICT means that organizations must focus on digital resilience to minimize risk of not being able to deliver critical and important services. </p><h2 id="who-does-dora-apply-to">Who Does DORA Apply To?</h2><p>The measures detailed by DORA will be applicable to both traditional and non-traditional financial entities operating in the EU and their ICT providers. ICT is broad and covers tools like cloud computing, software, hardware, transactions, communications, data, internet access, and more. </p><h2 id="why-is-dora-being-implemented">Why is DORA Being Implemented?</h2><p>The increasing reliance on digital technologies in the financial sector has been heard loud and clear - thus DORA was proposed. DORA aims to make sure that financial institutions can withstand, respond to, and recover from ICT-related disruptions and threats. Ultimately the Act aims to elevate the operational resilience of financial entities, safeguard financial stability, and protect consumers from the adverse impacts of digital disruptions. </p><h2 id="impact-of-cyber-attacks-on-financial-sector">Impact of Cyber Attacks on Financial Sector</h2><p>The financial sector saw a dramatic increase in Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, with a 154% rise from 2022 to 2023. In EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) the financial services sector accounted for 66% of all DDoS attacks, compared with 28% in North America. This surge in DDoS attacks against EMEA financial services institutions is likely due to geopolitical tensions and hacktivist activities related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, making the financial sector the most targeted by these types of attacks. (<a href="https://www.fsisac.com/newsroom/pr-akamai-ddos-report-2024">FS ISAC</a>) </p><p>Though not specifically against the Financial Sector, the MOVEit transfer attack highlights the impact of ICT. In 2023, a ransomware group named CL0P exploited a zero-day vulnerability in MOVEit, a managed file transfer software. This attack affected multiple organizations, including financial institutions and healthcare providers. CL0Ps <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/2023-annual-report">MOVEit campaign</a> garnered upwards of $100M in profit for the group, impacting over 2,750 organizations and 94 million individuals. It highlights the far-reaching impact software supply chain attacks can have.</p><h2 id="pillars-of-dora">Pillars of DORA</h2><ul><li><strong>ICT Risk Management and Governance:</strong> DORA will seek to mandate that the managing body of an organization holds ultimate responsibility for overseeing ICT risk. It emphasizes the need for a well-documented ICT risk management framework to swiftly, efficiently, and comprehensively tackle both cyber and physical risks. </li><li><strong>Incident Response and Reporting:</strong> Organizations will be required to maintain documented systems for monitoring, managing, logging, classifying, and reporting ICT-related incidents. This ensures prompt and effective responses to any issues that arise. </li><li><strong>Digital Operational Resilience Testing:</strong> Financial institutions under DORA must regularly test their defenses and identify any vulnerabilities in their ICT systems. This proactive approach helps maintain robust protections against potential threats. </li><li><strong>Third-Party Risk Management:</strong> DORA seeks to impose  requirements not only for financial institutions, but also for their ICT providers. Critical ICT third-party service providers are often subject to oversight from relevant managing bodies. Financial firms should actively manage ICT third-party risks through contractual agreements and diligent oversight, ensuring a comprehensive risk management strategy to ensure compliance.</li></ul><h2 id="what-is-nis2">What is NIS2?</h2><p>NIS2 aims to improve the cybersecurity capabilities across the EU by ensuring a high common level of cybersecurity across member states. NIS2 expands on the previous directive by addressing some gaps and shortcomings identified over the past few years.</p><h2 id="key-changes-introduced-by-nis2">Key Changes Introduced by NIS2</h2><p>NIS2 introduces several significant changes aimed at enhancing cybersecurity measures and ensuring a more uniform implementation across the EU. Some of the key changes include: </p><ul><li><strong>Broader Scope:</strong> NIS2 extends its coverage to more sectors, including public administration, space, manufacturing of critical products, and food supply chains, reflecting the evolving landscape of digital threats. </li><li><strong>Stricter Security Requirements:</strong> The directive sets higher standards for cybersecurity risk management measures, incident reporting, and <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/solutions/supply-chain">supply chain security</a>. Organizations may need to implement a range of technical and organizational measures to protect their networks and information systems. </li><li><strong>Enhanced Cooperation and Information Sharing:</strong>  NIS2 promotes greater cooperation between member states and encourages information sharing among public and private entities to improve the overall security posture.</li><li><strong>Incident Reporting:</strong> Organizations are required to report significant incidents to relevant authorities within 24 hours, ensuring a swift response to potential threats.</li></ul><h2 id="areas-of-focus-for-organizations">Areas of Focus for Organizations</h2><p>Both DORA and NIS2 highlight the importance of risk management, <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/solutions/supply-chain">supply chain security</a>, and development and maintenance of robust incident response plans. In order to adapt to these requirements, there are some key areas for businesses to focus on: </p><h3 id="implementing-both-proactive-and-reactive-processes-towards-mitigating-risk">Implementing both proactive and reactive processes towards mitigating risk</h3><p>Implementing both proactive and reactive processes towards mitigating risk is crucial for true cyber resilience. Proactive measures, such as regular risk assessments, vulnerability scans, and the deployment of security controls, enable organizations to anticipate and prevent potential threats before they materialize. This forward-thinking approach helps to fortify an organizations defenses, ensuring that they are resilient against <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/cyber-threats/emerging-threats">emerging cyber threats</a>. On the other hand, reactive processes, including incident response plans, real-time monitoring, and forensic investigations, can be essential for addressing and mitigating the impact of security incidents when they occur. </p><h3 id="focusing-on-your-third-party-suppliers-as-a-part-of-your-organizations-attack-surface">Focusing on your third-party suppliers as a part of your organizations attack surface</h3><p>Third-party vendors are a critical component to todays modern business, helping to accelerate product deliveries, spur innovation, increase efficiency, and lower average costs. The average company shares confidential information with 583 parties, according to a Ponemon Institute study. Its no surprise why Gartner estimates that by 2025 nearly half of organizations worldwide will have experienced attacks on their software supply chains, a three-fold increase from 2021.  </p><p>The challenge is that more than 2/3 of organizations have a limited, ad hoc understanding, or none at all of their third and fourth party risk. </p><p>Traditionally the primary mechanism for managing down cyber supply chain risk has been through preventative measures: due diligence reviews, lengthy questionnaires, and extensive back and forth communication. These efforts are a blanket approach that is cumbersome, lacks scalability, and is difficult to enforce. Prevention is always an admirable pursuit, but detection is critical, especially in an increasingly connected world.

Key trends include the rise of infostealer malware, which dominated the threat landscape, and a significant 103% surge in Magecart attacks targeting e-commerce platforms. Ransomware groups have also evolved, using new techniques such as passwords to validate execution and prevent analysis. The exploitation of widely used remote access software like Ivanti Secure Connect, PAN-OS, and Microsoft SmartScreen was a focal point for cybercriminals and state-sponsored actors.</p><h2 id="h1-2024-malware-and-vulnerability-trends-report-what-you-need-to-know">H1 2024 Malware and Vulnerability Trends Report: What You Need to Know</h2><p>The first half of 2024 witnessed an escalation in sophisticated cyberattacks, with <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/threat-actors/threat-actor-types">threat actors</a> sharpening their techniques to exploit newly disclosed vulnerabilities, evade detection, and cause greater damage. In this report, we delve into the key trends shaping the cybersecurity landscape and what organizations can do to protect themselves.</p><h2 id="zero-day-vulnerabilities">Zero-day Vulnerabilities</h2><p>Zero-day vulnerabilities, particularly those affecting remote access and security solutions, became prime targets for cybercriminals and state-sponsored groups. Despite the availability of patches, attackers continued exploiting these vulnerabilities, which later became known as n-days. The ease of exploitation, combined with proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code circulating online, made these vulnerabilities attractive to less-sophisticated hackers. The <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/vulnerability-database">top vulnerabilities</a> exploited in H1 2024 included flaws in Ivanti Secure Connect, PAN-OS, and Microsoft Windows SmartScreen.</p><h2 id="infostealers-dominate-the-malware-landscape">Infostealers Dominate the Malware Landscape</h2><p>Infostealers dominated the malware landscape as the most prevalent malware category in the first half of 2024. LummaC2, a stealthy malware designed to harvest sensitive information, became the most active, replacing other well-known <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/shining-light-on-redline-stealer-malware">infostealers like RedLine</a>. These types of malware steal personal information, such as credit card details and login credentials, which are then sold on underground forums. The financial motivation behind these attacks has driven an increase in infostealer activity, posing a severe risk to businesses and individuals alike.</p><h2 id="ransomware-groups-evolve-their-tactics">Ransomware Groups Evolve Their Tactics</h2><p>Ransomware continued to be a significant threat, with groups like Fog, <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/ransomhub-draws-in-affiliates-with-multi-os-capability-and-high-commission-rates">RansomHub</a>, and 3AM adopting tactics to hinder analysis and evade detection. Notably, these ransomware operators began using passwords to validate the execution of their payloads, a technique that prevents security tools from automatically analyzing the malicious code. Additionally, we saw ransomware paired with malware loaders like GuLoader and Remcos, creating attack chains that were more difficult to detect and block.</p><h2 id="magecart-attacks-surge">Magecart Attacks Surge</h2><p><a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/magecart-attacks-the-dark-art-fraudsters-use-to-steal-payment-data">Magecart</a>, a form of cyberattack that targets e-commerce platforms by injecting malicious code to steal customer data, saw a staggering 103% increase in H1 2024. This surge was likely attributed to vulnerabilities in widely used platforms like Adobe Commerce and the appearance of new e-skimming tools, such as &quot;Sniffer by Fleras.&quot; As online retail continues to grow, these attacks present a significant risk to businesses and their customers, highlighting the need for stronger security measures on e-commerce sites.</p><h2 id="how-to-protect-your-organization">How to Protect Your Organization</h2><p>To mitigate the risks posed by these evolving threats, organizations must adopt a layered defense strategy that includes proactive monitoring, patch management, and employee education. Here are key steps to take:</p><ol><li><strong>Improve Patch Management:</strong> Ensure that vulnerabilities, especially in remote access software, are patched promptly. Automating <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/vulnerability-intelligence">patch management</a> can help reduce the window of opportunity for attackers.</li><li><strong>Implement Heuristic and Behavior-Based Detection:</strong> Deploy advanced threat detection systems that can identify suspicious behaviors, such as process hollowing or the use of less-common programming languages, like Lua or NIM.</li><li><strong>Educate Employees:</strong> Social engineering remains a key entry point for malware. Continuous education on phishing tactics and malware distribution methods is critical to reducing human error.</li><li><strong>Strengthen E-commerce Security:</strong> Businesses that rely on e-commerce must prioritize security by regularly auditing third-party integrations, implementing strict content security policies (CSPs), and conducting frequent vulnerability scans.</li></ol><h2 id="looking-ahead-what-to-expect-for-the-rest-of-2024">Looking Ahead: What to Expect for the Rest of 2024</h2><p>The remainder of 2024 will likely see an increase in the exploitation of newly discovered vulnerabilities in widely used enterprise software. Remote access tools and next-generation firewalls are expected to remain key targets due to their widespread use. Additionally, the trend of infostealers dominating the malware landscape will continue as demand for stolen credentials on underground markets persists. Magecart attacks are also expected to remain a serious threat, with attackers continuing to experiment with new e-skimming techniques. </p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2024-0910.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png"></p><p>Following exposure and sanctions by the US government, Intellexas Predator spyware activity appeared to decline. However, recent findings by Insikt Group reveal that Predator&#39;s infrastructure is back with modifications to evade detection and anonymize users. This resurgence highlights Predators ongoing use by customers in countries such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Angola. While Predator continues to pose significant privacy and security risks, especially to high-profile individuals like politicians and executives, new infrastructure changes make tracking users more difficult. Despite these efforts, defenders can mitigate risks by following cybersecurity best practices, including regular device updates, using lockdown mode, and deploying mobile device management systems. As spyware like Predator evolves, global efforts to regulate and curb its use remain crucial.</p><h2 id="predator-spyware-resurfaces-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-threat">Predator Spyware Resurfaces: What You Need to Know About the Threat</h2><p>After Intellexa, the creators of the infamous Predator spyware, faced sanctions and exposure, a noticeable reduction in Predator activity was observed. However, according to recent analysis by the Insikt Group, Predator is far from disappearing. The spyware infrastructure has resurfaced, posing renewed risks to privacy and security. With its return, operators have implemented new methods to obscure their activities, complicating efforts to trace and attribute their attacks.</p><p><strong>The Resurgence of Predator Spyware Infrastructure</strong></p><p>In 2024, public reporting and US government sanctions led to a sharp decline in Predator spyware activity. At the time, it appeared that global political efforts aimed at curbing spyware abuse were making significant progress. However, Insikt Groups recent findings point to a re-emergence of Predators infrastructure. New infrastructure tied to Predator was detected in multiple countries, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Angola.</p><p>This sophisticated spyware, primarily used by government actors, allows operators to infiltrate devices, gaining access to sensitive data like messages and contacts and even activating cameras and microphones without the users knowledge. </p><p><strong>Changes in Infrastructure and Evasion Tactics</strong></p><p>Predator&#39;s operators have significantly enhanced their infrastructure, adding layers of complexity to evade detection. The new infrastructure includes an additional tier in its multi-tiered delivery system, which anonymizes customer operations, making it even harder to identify which countries are using the spyware. This change makes it more difficult for researchers and cybersecurity defenders to track the spread of Predator.</p><p>Despite these changes, the mode of operation remains largely the same. The spyware likely continues to use both one-click and zero-click attack vectors, exploiting browser vulnerabilities and network access to install itself on targeted devices. Even though there are no reports of fully remote zero-click attacks, like those associated with Pegasus, Predator remains a dangerous tool in the hands of those targeting high-profile individuals.</p><p><strong>High-Profile Targets Remain at Risk</strong></p><p>One of the most concerning aspects of Predators return is its likely continued targeting of high-profile individuals. Politicians, executives, journalists, and activists are at the highest risk due to the intelligence value they hold for governments or other malicious actors. The costly licensing of Predator further suggests that operators reserve its use for strategic, high-value targets.</p><p>This widespread use of mercenary spyware, particularly against political opposition, has sparked concern in regions like the European Union. Investigations in Greece and Poland have already revealed how spyware has been used against opposition figures and journalists, raising serious questions about the legality and ethics of such surveillance.</p><p><strong>Best Practices for Defense</strong></p><p>Given Predator&#39;s renewed presence and the sophistication of its infrastructure, individuals and organizations must stay vigilant. Insikt Group has outlined several defensive measures that can help mitigate the risk of Predator spyware infiltration:</p><ol><li><strong>Regular Software Updates </strong> Keeping devices up to date with the latest security patches is crucial for reducing vulnerabilities that spyware like Predator exploits.</li><li><strong>Device Reboots </strong> Periodically rebooting devices can disrupt spyware operations, though it may not completely eliminate advanced spyware.</li><li><strong>Lockdown Mode </strong> Activating lockdown mode on devices can help block unauthorized access and exploitation attempts.</li><li><strong>Mobile Device Management (MDM) </strong> Implementing MDM systems allows organizations to manage and secure employee devices, ensuring they adhere to security protocols.</li><li><strong>Security Awareness Training </strong> Educating employees about spearphishing and other social engineering tactics can reduce the likelihood of falling victim to spyware attacks.</li></ol><p>These measures are particularly important for individuals in sensitive roles, such as those working in government, civil society, or corporate leadership positions.</p><p><strong>The Future of Spyware and Global Regulations</strong></p><p>Despite efforts to curb the use of spyware, the market for mercenary spyware is expected to grow. As demand for surveillance tools continues, more companies will likely emerge, developing new products and finding ways to bypass security defenses. The profitability of spyware and the competition within the industry make it likely that we will see even more sophisticated tools in the future.</p><p>In response to these threats, global efforts to regulate spyware continue. Investigations like those underway in the European Union may lead to stricter regulations on spyware sales and use. However, until significant international action is taken, Predator and similar tools will remain a persistent threat.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>The re-emergence of Predator spyware is a stark reminder of the growing dangers posed by mercenary spyware. While initial sanctions and public exposure seemed to have diminished its presence, recent developments show that Predator is still very much active. Its infrastructure has evolved, making it harder to track and identify users, but with the right cybersecurity practices in place, individuals and organizations can reduce their risk of becoming targets.</p><p>As the spyware market continues to expand, it is essential for governments and cybersecurity professionals to stay ahead of these threats. Public reporting, ongoing research, and stronger regulations are critical in minimizing the damage caused by tools like Predator.</p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2024-0905.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p><h2>Appendix A  Indicators of Compromise</h2><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td style="font-family:Courier New;background-color:#ffffff;"><strong>Domains:</strong><br>happytotstoys[.]com<br>holidaypriceguide[.]com<br>lesautreseux[.]com<br>masoloyakati[.]com<br>noisyball[.]com<br>nyirangongovrai[.]com<br>toysfourtots[.]com<br>yokananu[.]net<br><br><br><strong>IP Addresses:</strong><br>169.239.129[.]76<br>185.123.102[.]40<br>185.235.137[.]6<br>185.243.113[.]169<br>185.243.113[.]169<br>193.29.56[.]252<br>193.29.59[.]164<br>45.86.163[.]178<br>98.142.253[.]18<br></td></tr></tbody></table><p><br><br></p><h2>Appendix B  Mitre ATT&CK Techniques</h2><table>  <tr>   <td style="background-color:#0071CE;color:#ffffff;font-weight: 700;"><strong>Tactic: Technique</strong></td>   <td style="background-color:#0071CE;color:#ffffff;font-weight: 700;"><strong>ATT&CK Code</strong></td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td><strong>Resource Development: Acquire Infrastructure: Domains</strong></td>   <td><a href="https://app.recordedfuture.com/live/sc/entity/mitre:T1583.003">T1583.001</a></td>  </tr>    <tr>   <td><strong>Resource Development: Acquire Infrastructure: Virtual Private Server</strong></td>   <td><a href="https://app.recordedfuture.com/live/sc/entity/mitre:T1584">T1583.003</a></td>  </tr>    <tr>   <td><strong>Resource Development: Acquire Infrastructure: Server</strong></td>   <td><a href="https://app.recordedfuture.com/live/sc/entity/mitre:T1595.002">T1583.004</a></td>  </tr>    <tr>   <td><strong>Initial Access: Spearphishing Link</strong></td>   <td><a href="https://app.recordedfuture.com/live/sc/entity/mitre:T1190">T1566.002</a></td>  </tr></table>]]></content:encoded>

Targeting US political and government entities, GreenCharlie utilizes sophisticated phishing operations and malware like GORBLE and POWERSTAR. The group&#39;s infrastructure, which includes domains registered with dynamic DNS (DDNS) providers, enables the groups phishing attacks.</p><p><strong>GreenCharlies Persistent Threat</strong></p><p>Since June 2024, Insikt Group has tracked infrastructure linked to GreenCharlie, an Iran-nexus cyber threat group with connections to Mint Sandstorm, Charming Kitten, and APT42. Insikt Group analysis linked GreenCharlie infrastructure to malware which is reported to have been used to target US political campaign officials, government entities, and strategic assets. </p><p>GreenCharlie is associated with malware, including POWERSTAR (also known as CharmPower and GorjolEcho) and GORBLE, the latter of which was identified by Google-Mandiant. Both GORBLE and POWERSTAR are variants of the same malware family, designed to enable espionage activity via spearphishing campaigns. </p><p>Iran and its associated cyber-espionage actors have consistently demonstrated both the intent and capability to engage in influence and interference operations targeting US elections and domestic information spaces. These campaigns are likely to continue utilizing hack-and-leak tactics aimed at undermining or supporting political candidates, influencing voter behavior, and fostering discord.</p><p>The groups infrastructure is meticulously crafted, utilizing dynamic DNS (DDNS) providers like Dynu, DNSEXIT, and Vitalwerks to register domains used in phishing attacks. These domains often employ deceptive themes related to cloud services, file sharing, and document visualization to lure targets into revealing sensitive information or downloading malicious files.</p><p>Recorded Futures Network Intelligence has identified multiple Iran-based IP addresses communicating with GreenCharlies infrastructure. The use of ProtonVPN and ProtonMail further indicates an attempt to obfuscate the groups activities, a common tactic among Iranian APTs.</p><p>GreenCharlies phishing operations are highly targeted, often employing social engineering techniques that exploit current events and political tensions. The group has registered numerous domains since May 2024, many of which are likely used for phishing activities. These domains are linked to DDNS providers, which allow for rapid changes in IP addresses, making it difficult to track the groups activities.</p><p>The malware deployed by GreenCharlie, including GORBLE and POWERSTAR, follows a multi-stage infection process. After initial access through phishing, the malware establishes communication with command-and-control (C2) servers, enabling the attackers to exfiltrate data or deliver additional payloads.</p><p>To

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png"></p><p>Chinas military and defense industry have prioritized the development of amphibious armored vehicles with high water speed (HWS) capabilities in preparation for potential Taiwan <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/navigating-2024s-geopolitical-fault-lines">invasion scenarios</a>. Following the successful development of the Type-05 family of HWS amphibious armored vehicles in the early 2000s, Chinas military and defense industry have continued to develop amphibious armored vehicles with new or improved capabilities, maintaining their focus on HWS. The <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/peoples-liberation-army-south-china-sea-organizational-guide">Peoples Liberation Army</a> (PLA) very likely believes that such vehicles would be instrumental in securing beachheads and ensuring the success of initial landing operations during an invasion of <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/from-coercion-to-invasion-the-theory-and-execution-of-china-cyber-activity">Taiwan</a>. </p><h2 id="the-type-05">The Type-05</h2><p>In 2009, China publicly unveiled the Type-05 amphibious armored vehicle, recognized as the world&#39;s fastest, with water speeds reported between 27 and 45 kilometers per hour. The Type-05 family includes variants designed for different battlefield roles, such as assault, infantry fighting, command, reconnaissance, medical, and obstacle-clearing. Both the PLA Army (PLAA) and the PLA Navy Marine Corps (PLANMC) utilize these vehicles, though the PLAA would likely operate the majority in a large-scale operation against Taiwan.</p><h2 id="continuous-development-and-innovation">Continuous Development and Innovation</h2><p>Since the Type-05s introduction, China has continued to develop new variants of existing vehicles and entirely new amphibious armored vehicles. Open-source reporting, our analysis of over 100 patents filed between 2014 and 2023, and procurement data reveal a consistent effort to increase water speeds. Engineers in China have also sought to streamline transitions between water and land, optimize maintenance, reduce corrosion, increase land mobility, and improve operational safety, among other areas of interest. In recent years, prototypes and experimental tests have reportedly achieved water speeds of 50 kilometers per hour or faster.</p><h2 id="operational-challenges">Operational Challenges</h2><p>The PLA very likely views joint island landing campaigns as contests of speed, requiring rapid and continuous assaults to establish defensible beachheads. This perspective drives the PLAs prioritization of HWS amphibious armored vehicles. The development of the Type-05 required novel solutions to various technical challenges, such as designing dynamically adjustable bow and (possibly) stern flaps to generate lift and reduce water resistance.</p><p>However, the effectiveness of these vehicles in a Taiwan invasion scenario is not guaranteed. The PLANs sealift capacity, weather conditions, the sea state in the Taiwan Strait, and Taiwans geography pose significant challenges. Current estimates suggest the PLAN cannot generate enough sealift for the number of vehicles operated by the PLAAs amphibious combined arms brigades, and supplementing the PLANs fleet with PLAA landing craft and civilian merchant vessels would very likely create additional challenges.</p><h2 id="outlook">Outlook</h2><p>Chinas defense industry will almost certainly continue researching and developing amphibious armored vehicles, with HWS remaining a priority. This ongoing development will very likely include incremental improvements to existing vehicles and the introduction of new variants. Despite these vehicles&#39; advanced capabilities, external factors such as limited sealift capacity and challenging geographic conditions may diminish their operational effectiveness.</p><p>China&#39;s development of amphibious armored vehicles, particularly the Type-05, demonstrates significant advancements in military technology aimed at enhancing the PLA&#39;s capabilities in potential invasion scenarios of Taiwan. For defense planners in Taiwan, the United States, and other concerned countries, it is essential to monitor Chinas advancements in amphibious armored vehicles. Understanding these developments can inform preparations and strategies to counter potential cross-strait invasion scenarios.</p><p>The author, Zoe Haver, thanks Joshua Arostegui and Jake Vartanian of the US Army War Colleges China Landpower Studies Center for their generous support. </p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/ta-2024-0815.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>]]></content:encoded>

These activities are reminiscent of previous attempts to influence elections in France and other democratic countries. Insikt Group has identified three major thematic trends: exploiting protests related to the Israel-Hamas conflict to undermine trust in US institutions, reducing support for military aid to US allies, and influencing voter perception of political candidates. Domestic violent extremists (DVEs) also pose a significant threat by targeting election personnel and echoing foreign narratives.</p><h2 id="malign-influence-threats-mount-ahead-of-us-2024-elections">Malign Influence Threats Mount Ahead of US 2024 Elections</h2><p>The US 2024 presidential elections are approaching, and with them comes a heightened risk of foreign and domestic influence operations. These operations are designed to shape public opinion, disrupt the electoral process, and ultimately achieve strategic geopolitical goals. The Insikt Group has been closely monitoring these developments and has identified key trends and threats.</p><h3 id="foreign-influence-operations">Foreign Influence Operations</h3><p><strong>Russia</strong></p><p>Russia remains highly active in conducting malign influence operations ahead of the US elections. The Doppelgnger and CopyCop networks, along with assets previously associated with the Internet Research Agency (IRA), are using sophisticated tactics to impersonate US citizens and media outlets. These networks aim to exploit socio-political divisions in the US and undermine public trust in the electoral process. Despite high levels of activity, these operations likely have not yet significantly impacted voter behavior.</p><p><strong>China</strong></p><p>China&#39;s Empire Dragon network is amplifying content on polarizing domestic issues such as racial inequality and campus protests. Although these operations have achieved little organic engagement, they continue to produce high volumes of content with the aim of sowing discord. China&#39;s approach to the US elections is likely cautious, avoiding large-scale cyber-enabled influence to protect its international reputation.</p><p><strong>Iran</strong></p><p>Iran is using a cyclical approach to spread anti-US propaganda related to the elections. This includes developing covert social media accounts and utilizing the International Union of Virtual Media (IUVM) network to disseminate content. While Iran&#39;s efforts have seen minimal engagement so far, they pose a threat to US political stability.</p><p><strong>Domestic Violent Extremists (DVEs)</strong></p><p>DVEs in the US are contributing to the threat landscape by physically threatening election officials and infrastructure. These actors are motivated by various ideological beliefs and are likely to increase their activities as the elections draw near. The attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump has exacerbated tensions, with DVEs potentially seeking to use violence to influence political outcomes.</p><p><strong>Mitigation Strategies</strong></p><p>To counter these threats, a whole-of-government approach is needed, integrated with private industry and social media platforms. Key strategies include:</p><ul><li><strong>Proactive Monitoring:</strong> Utilizing tools like the Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud to identify emerging threats in the information environment.</li><li><strong>AI-Driven Analysis:</strong> Leveraging AI to process large volumes of influence content, extract narratives, and draw analytical conclusions.</li><li><strong>Public Awareness:</strong> Media organizations and the public sector should continue to inform the public about the tactics, intents, and impact of foreign influence operations.</li></ul><p>The 2024 US elections are set against a backdrop of increased influence operations. While these activities have not yet significantly impacted the electoral process, they pose a serious threat to public trust and democratic institutions. A coordinated effort involving government, private sector, and media organizations is essential to counter these threats and protect the integrity of the elections. </p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/ta-2024-0813.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png"></p><p>The physical threat of Iranian-made unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, has been evident in conflict zones over Israel, the Red Sea, and Ukraine. Irans burgeoning drone industry also poses significant challenges to global businesses and Western governments. Insikt Group identifies five primary risks: compliance violations due to illicit procurement networks, reputational harm from the use of Western components in drones, technology transfer through reverse engineering, global proliferation of drone technology, and heightened cybersecurity threats. Despite international sanctions, Irans drone production and export have expanded, involving partnerships with countries like Russia.</p><h2 id="a-global-security-threat">A Global Security Threat</h2><p>Iranian UAVs have proliferated as a global security threat over the past year. In April 2024, Tehran launched an unprecedented direct attack on Israel involving the launch of 170 drones, and by the start of 2024, Russia had reportedly launched over 3,700 Iranian-made Shahed drones to devastating effect on the front lines in Ukraine. Iran and its proxies have used these unmanned aircraft across the Middle East, including targeting United States military bases in the region, striking critical infrastructure in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and attacking Western naval ships and international commercial vessels from the Red Sea to the Persian Gulf. The broad use of Iranian drones across regional conflicts almost certainly reflects the strategic prioritization  at the highest levels of the Iranian government  of developing, producing, and proliferating these systems.</p><h2 id="compliance-and-reputational-risks">Compliance and Reputational Risks</h2><p>Irans production of drones relies heavily on an evolving global network to procure foreign-made components. This network exposes Western defense and manufacturing companies to <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/governance-risk-compliance-challenges">compliance violations</a> and reputational harm. By acquiring components through illicit means, Iran circumvents international sanctions and integrates Western technology into its drones. Businesses must therefore maintain robust compliance programs and stay vigilant about the red flags associated with Iranian procurement tactics.</p><h2 id="technology-transfer-and-cybersecurity-risks">Technology Transfer and Cybersecurity Risks</h2><p>Irans ability to domestically reproduce foreign technology poses a significant threat. By reverse-engineering Western components, Iran undermines the effectiveness of export controls and sanctions. Moreover, Iranian cyber-espionage capabilities present an ongoing threat to Western defense contractors. <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/iran-cyber-operations-structure">Iranian APT groups</a> are likely targeting companies involved in aerospace and drone technology to advance their own capabilities.</p><h2 id="global-proliferation-of-iranian-drones">Global Proliferation of Iranian Drones</h2><p>The global expansion of Iranian drone exports and production is particularly concerning. Irans partnerships, notably with Russia, enhance the capabilities of both countries drone programs. Iran&#39;s drones have been used in conflicts across European, African, and South American theaters, demonstrating their strategic importance. Most notably, the collaboration between Iran and Russia in drone production has significantly boosted Moscows ability to destroy critical infrastructure in Ukraine.</p><h2 id="mitigation-strategies-for-businesses-and-governments">Mitigation Strategies for Businesses and Governments</h2><p>To counter these threats, businesses should implement comprehensive compliance programs, educate employees on illicit procurement practices, and strengthen cybersecurity measures. Governments must enhance their analytical resources to identify and target entities supporting Irans drone industry. International collaboration and consistent enforcement of export controls are crucial to mitigating the proliferation and development of Iranian drones.</p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/TA-IR-2024-0801.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Explore the latest challenges faced by CISOs, from data breaches to evolving regulations. Learn why resilience is now a critical business imperative.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="recent-incidents-have-cisos--and-everyone-else--talking">Recent Incidents Have CISOs  and Everyone Else  Talking</h1><p>Unfortunately, we regularly see companies digitally compromised with associated massive data breaches. More recently, while not a cyber attack, the world has watched a defective software update cause widespread global system outages. And without fail, regardless of the event type, we subsequently observe threat actors immediately launch social engineering campaigns to trick people seeking technology fixes into sharing sensitive information. For example, and to ensure that threat actors arent able to do even more harm after calamity, Recorded Future identified approximately 25 new malicious phishing domains using the recent CrowdStrike incident as a lure which weve published to all of our customers as an indicator note.</p><p>Looking ahead, as the Paris Olympics began last week, <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/hurdling-over-hazards-multifaceted-threats-to-the-2024-paris-olympics">Recorded Futures Insikt Group identified three key risks</a>: cybercriminals targeting critical sectors with ransomware, hacktivists attempting disruptions due to geopolitical conflicts, and state actors engaging in espionage and influence operations.</p><p>While these events or risks might seem unique, they have two things in common. They all have global repercussions, and were sure to see events on a similar scale happen again in the future. Thats why, when a cyberattack or IT incident occurs, organizations need to think beyond the immediate event and its resolution to identify the potential trickle-down effects that can occur. What are the second- and third-level ramifications of these types of global events? </p><h2 id="whats-keeping-cisos-up-at-night">Whats keeping CISOs up at night?</h2><p>With every new security breach, IT incident, ransomware campaign, or social engineering attack that hits the news cycle, boards of directors and other business leaders naturally reach out to their CISOs with questions. In addition, these recent high-profile incidents have exposed a stark reality: our drive for efficiency and standardization has created a landscape riddled with potential single points of failure.</p><p>For example, as weve seen companies grappling with data exposures, the implications of breaches extend far beyond a companys immediate operations. The unauthorized disclosure of customer data, internal documents, intellectual property, and strategic plans can have long-lasting effects on competitiveness and reputation. Board members want to know details about whats happening, all the possible ways the business might be affected, and how the security team plans to beef up defenses and mitigate similar risks. They want to feel confident that theyre doing their due diligence, asking the right questions, and helping the executive team appropriately time investments.</p><p>In addition to managing the technical aspects of security, CISOs <a href="https://intelligence2risk.substack.com/p/navigating-the-shifting-sands-of">increasingly</a> must navigate a complex patchwork of local, national, and international regulatory and compliance regimes. </p><p>This regulatory landscape is in flux, adding another layer of complexity to the CISO&#39;s role. Case in point: two weeks ago, a judge struck down much of the US Security and Exchange Commission&#39;s (SEC) fraud case against the former CISO of SolarWinds. This ruling adds to the increasing uncertainty about how cybersecurity is regulated in the US.</p><p>With all this uncertainty, theres no shortage of potential questions keeping CISOs up at night. The answers lie not in reactionary measures, but in a fundamental shift towards resilience.</p><h2 id="resilience-is-the-word-of-the-year">Resilience is the Word of the Year</h2><p>Today&#39;s CISOs are navigating uncharted waters, facing unprecedented professional and personal risks. They need to clearly articulate the new landscape of risks to leadership, emphasizing the need for comprehensive resilience strategies. Key considerations include:</p><ul><li>All-hazards planning: Assess and rank various hazards based on their likelihood and potential impact. </li><li>Data mapping: locate, with confidence, all protected data, both structured and unstructured, local and cloud, encrypted and not yet encrypted. </li><li>Comprehensive dependency mapping: Identify direct service providers and underlying infrastructure dependencies.</li><li>Cascading impact analysis: Model potential &quot;splash damage&quot; from major provider failures, including second and third-order effects.</li><li>Communication continuity: Establish backup channels independent of potentially compromised systems</li><li>Trust and reputation management: Develop strategies for rebuilding trust after breaches.</li></ul><p>As we chart this new reality with higher technical complexity and global uncertainty, CISOs must lead the charge in reframing the conversation. It&#39;s no longer just about preventing breaches or minimizing downtime. It&#39;s about building organizations that can adapt, evolve, and thrive in the face of cyber disruptions. In a world where a single point of failure can have cascading global effects, resilience isn&#39;t just an IT issue  it&#39;s a business imperative.</p><p>For more expert insights, <a href="https://predict.recordedfuture.com/">join us at Predict.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

This campaign, detected on April 17, 2024, involves 608 fraudulent websites using brand impersonation and malvertising tactics to steal personal and financial data. Notably, the scam websites were accessible only via mobile devices and ad lures, likely to evade automated scanners. Recorded Future recommends blocklisting suspicious merchant accounts and closely monitoring customer transactions. The use of advanced screening techniques in this campaign suggests a growing trend that might challenge current detection technologies.</p><h2 id="eriakos-scam-campaign-unveiling-a-complex-web-of-fraud">ERIAKOS Scam Campaign: Unveiling a Complex Web of Fraud</h2><p>On April 17, 2024, Recorded Futures <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/payment-fraud-intelligence">Payment Fraud Intelligence</a> team uncovered a network of 608 scam e-commerce websites, orchestrated by a single threat actor or group, targeting Facebook users. Named the ERIAKOS campaign after the CDN used (oss[.]eriakos[.]com), these scam sites employed brand impersonation and malvertising tactics to steal victims&#39; financial and personal data. These fraudulent sites were accessible only through mobile devices and ad lures, a tactic aimed at evading automated detection systems and our first direct observation of such a TTP.This sophisticated campaign exclusively targeted mobile users who accessed the scam sites via ad lures on Facebook. This strategic move significantly reduced the likelihood of detection by automated scanners. Merchant accounts linked to these scam websites processed payments through major card networks and Chinese PSPs, adding another layer of complexity to the fraud.</p><p><a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/threat-intelligence-for-financial-services">Financial institutions are at risk of financial fraud</a>, including chargeback disputes and irrecoverable losses.

I was recently in Singapore, engaging in a fireside chat with the esteemed <a href="https://www.nets.com.sg/newsroom/nets-appoints-john-yong-as-non-executive-independent-director">John Yong</a>. John, a seasoned expert in security practice, policy, and administration, currently serves in multiple oversight/governance roles. During our conversation, John emphasized that any threat report or narrative that fails to adequately capture volume and velocity is, in his view, a C- at best. As he put it, its a $10 story. The security industry, he believes, needs better resources to consistently develop $1M stories. </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/939e3fca_764d_48a5_8f68_acb2ce2076c9_1600x1331_03e7875171.webp" alt="939e3fca-764d-48a5-8f68-acb2ce2076c9_1600x1331.webp"></p><h2 id="volume--velocity">Volume &amp; Velocity</h2><p>Johns grading assessment underscores the importance of volume and velocity in convincing readers of the necessity for action. Simply put, volume represents the magnitude of change, while velocity highlights how quickly the change has occurred. As cybersecurity professionals, our data-driven discussions are powerful influencers toward a desired outcome, often leading to buy-in on new security control investments. </p><p>Volume and velocity are the two variables that underpin a compelling threat implication. Great cyber intelligence will provide this context, similar to the business intelligence financial traders require to execute trades while monitoring financial markets. Professional traders who ignore volume and velocity do so at their peril. The same applies to cyber security and intelligence leaders, whether they know it or not. </p><p>Lets review a few examples where volume and velocity create different enterprise recommendations. </p><h2 id="arm-exploit-volume">Arm Exploit Volume</h2><p>In a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCMJdAkzQE0">Bloomberg interview</a>, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella revealed that Microsoft is all in on manufacturing hardware (personal computers) optimized for GenAI to enable local/edge-accessible capabilities. Others, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcOhAvWF0cc">like Dell</a>, echo their intent to move quickly to the same destination. While this is good news for Wall Street favorites like Nvidia, CIOs should look for the second-order business, technology, and security implications of the proliferation of GenAI-enabled hardware. </p><p>One apparent second-order effect is the increased adoption of Arm semiconductors, which is potentially less considered in this local AI hardware movement. What are the potential security considerations as workstations move from using Intels traditional <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/arm-vs-x86-key-differences-explained-568718/">x86 architected semiconductors to Arm</a>? Are CISOs developing recommendations? How do volume and velocity factor in? Lets find out.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/97a1458d_6ba1_4483_91e6_ee56f4fc6323_1024x1024_b0f802b937.webp" alt="97a1458d-6ba1-4483-91e6-ee56f4fc6323_1024x1024.webp"></p><p>When performing Recorded Future platform searches, <a href="https://azeria-labs.com/arm-data-types-and-registers-part-2/">specific memory registers</a> and <a href="https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/ROPgadget">exploit framework library</a> syntax enable differentiated selectors between Arm and x86 semiconductor architectures.

Now, more discovery/analysis is needed to understand context and velocity.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/c253f5eb_5764_44f2_abc0_912d9986bfe2_1600x364_c3d6f0150b.webp" alt="c253f5eb-5764-44f2-abc0-912d9986bfe2_1600x364.webp"></p><p><em>Image: Recorded Future LLM summarization of Arm exploit results.</em></p><p>The results primarily derive from <a href="https://github.com/giladreti/pwnable/commit/d5e9f7c0216f78487680b9ca507192ee33da611c">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://hackyx.io/#2098">Hackyx</a>, as well as a smattering of different foreign language forums and chat channels. </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/8c44249f_102e_4f78_a9f7_086605030c0e_1280x1148_ca71415ec5.webp" alt="8c44249f-102e-4f78-a9f7-086605030c0e_1280x1148.webp"></p><p><em>Image: A 1000 yard stare meme overlaid on a <a href="https://lightfootlabs.io/resources/Learn-Buffer-Overflows-through-Visuals">buffer overflow</a> example, possibly derived from code found at <a href="https://deephacking.tech/buffer-overflow-32-bits-en-slmail-5-5/">deephacking.tech</a>.</em></p><p>As referenced in the <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/introducing-intelligence-to-risk-pyramid">Intelligence to Risk (I2R) framework</a>, broad consumption of different event types creates more confidence in volume and velocity, which influences a threat implication and potential future associated risk recommendation. Open and closed-sourced code references provide an initial volume signal in this example. Additional data sourcing might also include honeynets and malware sample analysis. </p><p>A ninety-day search through <a href="https://tria.ge/240417-lpnl1abc26">Triage</a> for files that match Linux and Arm tags returns roughly 6000 results. Thats a relatively small number in the pantheon of daily malware processed, but file verdicts provide a different event source to track over time for significant changes in volume and velocity. </p><p>Arm taking a greater market share of global computing wont happen overnight. However, we can already see threat actors taking an interest in exploits, and the volume will likely increase as Arm chips proliferate in mainstream computing platforms. The gradual shift could create security implications that organizations want to proactively address, starting with endpoint defense and a review of commercial solutions. </p><h2 id="network-exploit-velocity">Network Exploit Velocity</h2><p>Quantifying velocity is as much about pattern recognition as the time change state between data points. As <a href="https://intelligence2risk.substack.com/p/cyber-silk-road-tracing-chinas-stealth">previously mentioned</a>, China is actively exploiting network appliances for multiple reasons, and more defender effort is required as traditional host-based security solutions (i.e., AV/EDR/XDR) are rendered impotent. </p><p>The velocity component is relevant to address as it drives the movement level in attack proximity for any of the <a href="https://intelligence2risk.substack.com/p/five-risk-categories">five risk impacts</a>. A more significant <a href="https://intelligence2risk.substack.com/p/charting-new-terrain-the-shift-to">east/west move in the proximity &amp; resilience graph</a> may drive more operational urgency, depending on the corresponding level of resilience. </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/25fc129b_23cc_48ee_9386_3aac42b7b03d_1600x1009_e9f390cea0.webp" alt="25fc129b-23cc-48ee-9386-3aac42b7b03d_1600x1009.webp"></p><p><em>Image: An example of a Proximity &amp; Resilience Graph</em></p><p><a href="https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nxos-cmd-injection-xD9OhyOP">Cisco network appliances</a> are a recent example of <a href="https://www.sygnia.co/threat-reports-and-advisories/china-nexus-threat-group-velvet-ant-exploits-cisco-0-day/">Chinas zero-day exploit targeting</a>.

In the subsequent graph, a volume change is represented across two different categories of vulnerabilities. A comprehensive search and verified results for applicable vulnerabilities with associated exploitation are a starting point, and ongoing signals from telemetry like darknets/honeypots can also provide more current and timely data toward an accurate velocity representation. Audiences should quickly identify the potential urgency attached to the threat, which dictates the speed of I2R pyramid traversal to ultimately implement recommendations. </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/184d77f3_1aac_459d_bc5d_537c51cd3695_1600x796_57b2d9bda2.webp" alt="184d77f3-1aac-459d-bc5d-537c51cd3695_1600x796.webp"></p><p><em>Image: A 2023 - 2024 timeline containing samples of network equipment exploitation courtesy of Recorded Future.</em></p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/acf6eebb_4735_4b9c_9f1b_9c899bbec413_1200x742_003d920b07.webp" alt="acf6eebb-4735-4b9c-9f1b-9c899bbec413_1200x742.webp"></p><p><em>Image: Cumulative cyber attack and exploit references to vulnerabilities divided between network appliances and enterprise software, courtesy of <a href="https://www.dylandavis.net/2022/12/d-squared-musings/">Dylan Davis</a> and Recorded Future.</em></p><p>Similarly, Recorded Futures Insikt Group recently released a <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/tag-100-uses-open-source-tools-in-suspected-global-espionage-campaign">report on Threat Actor Group 100</a> (TAG-100, which is likely a state-sponsored group from a country that begins with  and ends with ), which has compromised organizations in over ten countries.

Based on anecdotal feedback, EDR/XDR software sometimes lacks robust detections for offensive open-source resources. </p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>As a security professional, how can you persuade executives to smartly invest? Your role is crucial in this process. Envision a typical enterprise environment: the breaches making the latest rounds of headlines are in different industries. Wheres the fire? The metaphorical moat seems to be holding. Audits passed. The GRC/ERM organization is documenting the risks. The organization has previously invested in substantial security controls. Your insights can help shape the narrative and drive action where needed the most (and sometimes, inaction is an equally valid risk management decision). </p><p>Intelligence should be sourced from data that creates proactive opportunities to evaluate and communicate threat volume and velocity. These two factors move emerging threats from theoretical to practicalwhat separates a $1M story from just another presentation slide. As an industry, we need more $1M stories to help build confidence in aligning cyber risk management strategies with business needs and objectives.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png"></p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>Between Q4 2023 and Q1 2024, cybercriminals increasingly used QR codes and AI-generated phishing tactics to target executives, exploiting AWS SNS for malicious SMS and VAST tags for malvertising. These sophisticated methods enable threat actors to bypass security measures, capture multi-factor authentication (MFA) tokens, and deceive users more effectively. The report highlights a 433% increase in references to QR code phishing and a 1,265% rise in phishing attacks potentially linked to AI tools like ChatGPT. To protect against these threats, organizations should increase employee training, deploy advanced security tools, and ensure oversight of corporate and personal devices.</p><h3 id="security-challenges-rise-as-qr-code-and-ai-generated-phishing-proliferate">Security Challenges Rise as QR Code and AI-Generated Phishing Proliferate</h3><p>Phishing threats continue to evolve as cybercriminals adopt innovative techniques. Between Q4 2023 and Q1 2024, Insikt Group&#39;s research reveals a surge in QR code and <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/adversarial-intelligence-red-teaming-malicious-use-cases-ai">AI-generated</a> phishing attacks targeting executives and leveraging sophisticated methods to bypass security measures.</p><p>QR code phishing, also known as &quot;quishing,&quot; involves using manipulated or fake QR codes for malicious purposes. This technique has become prevalent, with a 433% increase in QR code scans between 2021 and 2023. Phishing-as-a-service platforms like Tycoon 2FA and <a href="https://therecord.media/phishing-as-a-service-tool-greatness-used-by-hackers-cisco">Greatness</a> now incorporate QR codes to steal credentials and MFA tokens. Executives are particularly targeted, receiving 42 times more QR code attacks than other employees due to their broader access to company resources.</p><p>The rise of large language models (LLMs) like <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/i-chatbot">ChatGPT</a> has almost certainly facilitated the creation of highly believable phishing emails that are devoid of grammatical errors, more convincing, and harder to detect. Threat actors can generate 1,000 phishing emails in under two hours for as little as $10, with LLMs likely contributing to a 1,265% increase in phishing attacks. <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/threat-actors/threat-actor-types">Threat actors</a> have also started using Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Notification Service (SNS) to automate smishing attacks and Video Ad Serving Templates (VAST) tags for malvertising. These methods allow cybercriminals to scale their operations and evade detection. SNS Sender scripts enable bulk malicious SMS delivery, while VAST tags deliver malicious links through video players, redirecting victims to phishing pages.</p><p><strong>Mitigations</strong></p><p>To counter these evolving threats, organizations should implement several measures:</p><ol><li>Employee Education: Regular training and phishing simulations, including QR code-based scenarios, can help users identify and report suspicious activities.</li><li>Secure QR Code Scanning Apps: Use QR code scanning apps with security features like URL filtering to detect malicious codes.</li><li>Endpoint Security Solutions: Enhance mobile device security with comprehensive endpoint security solutions and MDM systems.</li><li>Advanced Machine Learning Detection: Employ advanced ML systems for detecting AI-generated phishing emails.</li><li>SMS Filtering Technology: Use SMS filtering to identify and block malicious SMS messages.</li><li>VAST Tag Validation: Validate VAST tags before integration to detect malicious content.</li></ol><p>The future of cybersecurity will likely see continued use of <a href="https://therecord.media/phishing-campaign-used-qr-codes-to-target-energy-firm">QR code phishing</a>, AWS SNS smishing, and VAST tags malvertising due to their effectiveness in bypassing security measures. However, as security solutions evolve and user awareness improves, the popularity of these techniques may decline. Meanwhile, the increasing use of LLMs for phishing is expected to persist, making it essential for organizations to stay ahead with advanced security measures and continuous employee education.</p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2024-0718.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This includes Apple, Samsung, and Huawei devices, as well as various social media platforms. A notable finding is the increased use of obfuscation services like VPNs and proxies to circumvent censorship and surveillance. These activities demonstrate North Koreans&#39; growing operational security awareness and highlight the regime&#39;s ability to acquire foreign technology, potentially undermining the effectiveness of sanctions.</p><h3 id="despite-sanctions-north-koreans-continue-to-use-foreign-technology">Despite Sanctions, North Koreans Continue to Use Foreign Technology</h3><p>Despite stringent international sanctions, <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/north-korea-internet-behavior">North Koreans continue to use foreign technology</a> to access the internet for personal and professional use. Findings based on Insikt Groups recent analysis of Recorded Future Network Intelligence data associated with North Korea, building on previous analyses between 2017 and 2020, show individuals in North Korea leverage devices and services from Apple, Samsung, Huawei, and others, showcasing a sophisticated approach to bypassing government censorship and maintaining global connectivity.</p><p>The analysis reveals <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/north-korea-internet-activity">North Koreans are not as isolated</a> as commonly perceived. Even with sanctions in place, a select group of individuals can access the internet and utilize various technologies to stay connected. This includes using smartphones, laptops, and tablets from well-known international brands. Despite the sanctions, North Korea continues to import foreign technology, often through its trade relationships with China and Russia. </p><p>A select subset of North Koreans engage in activities similar to those in other parts of the world, such as browsing social media, streaming content, and playing video games. Facebook, Instagram, and WeChat are commonly used. This trend persists despite the government&#39;s efforts to control information and restrict internet access.</p><p>A significant finding from the report is the increased use of obfuscation services. <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/north-korea-internet-usage">North Koreans are now more frequently using VPNs and proxy services</a> to evade domestic surveillance and censorship. This marks a shift towards greater operational security awareness among users who seek to avoid detection by the regime.</p><p>The findings suggest that organizations need to exercise due diligence when dealing with markets that may indirectly supply sanctioned entities. Companies should be vigilant about where their products end up, as there could be legal and financial repercussions if their technology is found in North Korea.</p><p>North Koreans are expected to continue using foreign technology despite sanctions due to ongoing trade with China and a growing relationship with Russia. Russia&#39;s recent veto against UN sanctions monitoring further complicates the imposition of new sanctions. North Koreans are likely to maintain global internet browsing patterns, use VPNs to mask activities, and rely on official news sources. These behaviors highlight the regime&#39;s resilience in accessing global technology.</p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/CTA-NK-2024-0718.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>]]></content:encoded>

TAG-100 exploited internet-facing devices and used open-source tools like the Go backdoor Pantegana. The campaign compromised two Asia-Pacific intergovernmental organizations and targeted multiple diplomatic and trade entities.</p><h3 id="tag-100-uses-open-source-tools-in-suspected-global-espionage-campaign-compromising-two-asia-pacific-intergovernmental-bodies">TAG-100 Uses Open-Source Tools in Suspected Global Espionage Campaign, Compromising Two Asia-Pacific Intergovernmental Bodies</h3><p>TAG-100 employs open-source remote access capabilities and exploits various internet-facing devices to gain initial access. This activity highlights the increasing trend of <a href="https://therecord.media/tag/cyber-espionage">cyber-espionage</a> using open-source tools, making it easier for less capable threat actors and reducing the need for customized capabilities. Two major Asia-Pacific intergovernmental organizations, along with multiple diplomatic, trade, and private sector entities globally, were likely compromised by TAG-100.</p><p><strong>Key Findings</strong></p><ul><li>TAG-100 has compromised organizations in at least ten countries across Africa, Asia, North America, South America, and Oceania.</li><li>The group used open-source Go backdoors Pantegana and <a href="https://therecord.media/tag/sparkrat">SparkRAT</a> post-exploitation.</li><li>TAG-100 targeted various internet-facing products, including Citrix NetScaler, F5 BIG-IP, Zimbra, Microsoft Exchange, SonicWall, Cisco ASA, Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect, and Fortinet FortiGate.</li><li>Following the release of a PoC exploit for Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect firewall vulnerability <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/vulnerability-database/CVE-2024-3400">CVE-2024-3400</a>, TAG-100 conducted reconnaissance and attempted exploitation against dozens of US-based organizations.</li></ul><p><strong>Impact and Implications</strong></p><p>The exploitation of vulnerable internet-facing devices by TAG-100 is particularly concerning due to the limited visibility and logging capabilities of these devices. This reduces the risk of detection post-exploitation and exposes organizations to operational downtime, reputational damage, and regulatory fines. The use of open-source tools also allows state-sponsored threat actors to outsource cyber operations to less capable groups, increasing the intensity and frequency of attacks on enterprise networks.</p><p><strong>Mitigations</strong></p><p>Organizations should:</p><ul><li>Configure intrusion detection and prevention systems to alert on and block suspicious IP addresses and domains.</li><li>Ensure security monitoring for all external-facing services and devices.</li><li><a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/vulnerability-management-prioritization">Prioritize patching vulnerabilities</a>, especially those exploited in the wild.</li><li>Implement network segmentation and multi-factor authentication.</li><li>Use the <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/threat-intelligence">Recorded Future Threat Intelligence</a> module to detect and block malicious infrastructures like Pantegana, SparkRAT, and Cobalt Strike command-and-control (C2) servers in real-time.</li><li><a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/third-party-intelligence">The Recorded Future Third-Party Intelligence</a> module helps monitor real-time outputs to identify suspected intrusion activities involving key vendors and partners.</li><li>Monitoring Malicious Traffic Analysis (MTA) enables Recorded Future clients to proactively alert and monitor infrastructure involved in communication with known TAG-100 C2 IP addresses.</li></ul><p><strong>Outlook</strong></p><p>TAG-100s activities highlight a persistent threat to internet-facing devices, with both financially motivated and state-sponsored threat actors likely to continue exploiting these vulnerabilities. The US and UK governments are working to improve security, but vulnerable network edges remain a significant risk.

They use malicious Android applications to steal credentials and gather intelligence, potentially to control aid distribution. Notable organizations affected include CARE International and the Norwegian Refugee Council. This report highlights the ongoing threat and suggests mitigation strategies, such as social engineering awareness, strong passwords, and multi-factor authentication.</p><h4 id="oilalpha-malicious-applications-target-humanitarian-aid-groups-operating-in-yemen">OilAlpha Malicious Applications Target Humanitarian Aid Groups Operating in Yemen</h4><p>In May 2023, <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/oilalpha-likely-pro-houthi-group-targeting-arabian-peninsula">Insikt Group first shared research on OilAlpha</a>, a pro-Houthi group that targets humanitarian organizations in Yemen using malicious Android applications. A year later, new findings reveal that OilAlpha remains active and poses a significant threat to humanitarian efforts in the region.</p><p>Our recent research identifies a fresh cluster of malicious mobile applications and infrastructure linked to OilAlpha. These applications target employees of globally recognized humanitarian organizations, including CARE International, the Norwegian Refugee Council, and the Saudi Arabian King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre.</p><p>In June 2024, we discovered a suspicious Android file named Cash Incentives.apk, connected to OilAlpha&#39;s infrastructure. The app requests invasive permissions, including access to the camera, audio, SMS, contacts, and more, classifying it as a remote access trojan (RAT). Subsequent analysis identified two more malicious applications targeting the Norwegian Refugee Council and CARE International, all attempting to steal credentials and gather sensitive information.</p><p>OilAlpha&#39;s operations include a credential theft portal hosted on the domain kssnew[.]online. This portal impersonates humanitarian organizations&#39; login pages, redirecting users to input their credentials, which are then harvested by the attackers.</p><p>To combat this threat, organizations should implement information security policies and conduct social engineering and anti-phishing awareness exercises. Strong passwords and multi-factor authentication (MFA) can significantly reduce the risk of credential theft.</p><p>Moreover, users should be cautious of direct messaging on social media and encrypted chats, verifying the authenticity of messages when possible. <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/third-party-intelligence">Recorded Future&#39;s Third-Party Intelligence module</a> can help identify and monitor OilAlpha&#39;s activities in real time. Install the <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform/browser-extension">Recorded Future Threat Intelligence Browser Extension</a> for instant access to threat intelligence, faster alert processing in SIEM, and prioritizing vulnerabilities.</p><p>For suspicious files, <a href="https://tria.ge/dashboard">Recorded Future&#39;s Malware Intelligence sandbox</a> provides detailed analysis. It observes the file&#39;s behavior in a controlled environment to understand its network connections and system changes.</p><p>OilAlpha&#39;s activities suggest an ongoing effort to control humanitarian aid distribution in Yemen. The group&#39;s focus on targeting humanitarian organizations is likely to continue, potentially expanding beyond Yemen. Recorded Future remains committed to monitoring and reporting on these threats to help safeguard humanitarian operations in the Middle East and beyond.</p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2024-0709.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Approximately 3,300 unique users were found with accounts on known CSAM sources. A notable 4.2% had credentials for multiple sources, suggesting a higher likelihood of criminal behavior. The study reveals how infostealer logs can aid investigators in tracking CSAM activities on the dark web. Data was escalated to law enforcement for further action.</p><h4 id="caught-in-the-net-using-infostealer-logs-to-unmask-csam-consumers"><strong>Caught in the Net: Using Infostealer Logs to Unmask CSAM Consumers</strong></h4><p><strong>Background</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/cybercriminal-campaign-spreads-infostealers-highlighting-risks-to-web3-gaming">Infostealer malware</a> steals sensitive <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/credential-stuffing-attacks">user information such as login credentials</a>, cryptocurrency wallets, payment card data, OS information, browser cookies, screenshots, and autofill data. Common distribution methods include phishing, spam campaigns, fake update websites, SEO poisoning, and malvertising. A popular infection vector is cracked software marketed to users seeking to obtain licensed software illegally. Stolen data, known as infostealer logs, often ends up on dark web sources where cybercriminals can purchase it, potentially gaining access to networks or systems.</p><p>The anonymity provided by Tor-based websites with <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/dark-web-reality">.onion domains</a> fosters the production and consumption of CSAM. Studies show that although only a small percentage of .onion websites host CSAM, the majority of dark web browsing activity targets these sites.</p><p><strong>Methodology</strong></p><p>In this proof-of-concept report, <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/identity-intelligence">Recorded Future&#39;s Identity Intelligence</a> leveraged infostealer malware data to identify consumers of child sexual abuse material (CSAM), surface additional sources, and uncover geographic and behavioral trends. Our high-confidence assessments stem from the nature of the infostealer log data and subsequent research. </p><p>Sample investigations of three individuals with accounts on multiple CSAM sources suggest that having multiple CSAM accounts may indicate a higher likelihood of committing crimes against children. This study demonstrates that infostealer logs can help law enforcement track child exploitation on the dark web, a challenging area to trace. All relevant findings have been reported to authorities.</p><p>Our research involved creating a list of known high-fidelity CSAM domains and querying Recorded Future Identity Intelligence data to identify users with credentials to these domains. Collaborating with non-profit organizations like World Childhood Foundation and the Anti-Human Trafficking Intelligence Initiative (ATII), Insikt Group expanded this list by querying the <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform/intelligence-cloud">Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud</a>. This iterative process helped identify additional CSAM sources.</p><p>Insikt Group then queried Recorded Futures Identity Intelligence, which offers real-time access to infostealer log information, for authentication records linked to known CSAM sources from February 2021 to February 2024. De-duplication was performed by comparing OS usernames and PC names.</p><p><strong>Findings</strong></p><p>Insikt Group identified 3,324 unique credentials used to access known CSAM websites. This data allowed us to gather statistics on individual sources and users, including their usernames, IP addresses, and system information. This granular data helps law enforcement understand the infrastructure of CSAM websites, uncover techniques used by CSAM consumers to mask their identities, and identify potential CSAM consumers and producers.</p><p>In three case studies, Insikt Group used the data contained in infostealer logs and open-source intelligence (OSINT) to identify two individuals and found further digital artifacts, including cryptocurrency addresses, belonging to a third individual. </p><p>The PoC study showcases that infostealer logs can be used to identify CSAM consumers and new sources and trends in CSAM communities.</p><p>As the cybercriminal demand for infostealer logs and malware-as-a-service (MaaS) ecosystems continues to grow, Insikt Group anticipates that infostealer log datasets will continue to provide current and evolving insights into CSAM consumers.  </p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2024-0702.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Russia-linked Doppelgnger network uses cloned websites and social media bots to promote pro-Russian content, while the CopyCop network leverages AI to disseminate pro-Russia narratives. Iran&#39;s involvement is limited, likely in response to Frances support for Israel. Despite the assessed minimal impact, continuous monitoring is crucial to mitigate these foreign operations. </p><h2 id="russian-and-iranian-influence-networks-target-french-elections">Russian and Iranian Influence Networks Target French Elections</h2><p>As the French elections draw near, Insikt Group&#39;s latest research has identified ongoing influence operations linked to Russia and Iran. These foreign malign influence actors are attempting to shape public opinion and voter behavior, though their impact remains minimal. </p><h3 id="russias-doppelgnger-network">Russia&#39;s Doppelgnger Network</h3><p>The most prominent of these operations is the Russia-linked <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/russian-influence-network-doppelgangers-ai-content-tactics">Doppelgnger</a> network, which targets French audiences with content that impersonates legitimate French media outlets. Using cloned websites, this network spreads pro-Russian, eurosceptic, and populist political positions. The network employs automated coordinated inauthentic behavior (CIB) on social media to amplify its reach, though authentic engagement appears low.</p><p>Doppelgngers narratives often portray French President Macron as ineffective and criticize his domestic and foreign policy. The network frames the National Rally (RN) party as a preferable alternative that offers practical solutions to France&#39;s challenges.</p><h3 id="copycops-ai-driven-influence">CopyCop&#39;s AI-Driven Influence</h3><p>Another Russia-linked network, <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/copycop-expands-to-cover-us-elections-target-political-leaders">CopyCop</a>, is also active in targeting French audiences. Using large language models (LLMs), CopyCop promotes pro-Russia content and undermines President Macrons administration. This network is notable for using AI-generated content to plagiarize and manipulate articles from legitimate French media sources. CopyCop recently registered two new websites, <em>veritecachee[.]fr</em> and <em>franceencolere[.]fr</em>, to continue its operations. One of them has an article likely trying to portray President Macron and his Renaissance party in a negative light by using an inauthentic website impersonating the presidential coalition Ensemble Pour La Rpublique to falsely promise Ensemble voters a 100 reward.</p><h3 id="irans-limited-involvement">Iran&#39;s Limited Involvement</h3><p>Irans influence operations are more limited but still present. The International Union of Virtual Media (IUVM) has been linked to efforts to undermine France due to its support for Israel. These activities are opportunistic and focus on amplifying negative narratives about Frances political landscape.</p><h3 id="mitigations">Mitigations</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud:</strong> Media organizations can use <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/brand-intelligence">Recorded Future Brand Intelligence</a> to identify and monitor potential forms of brand abuse, including typosquats, logotype detection, and other potential forms of brand abuse.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cyber threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated and frequent, making it imperative for organizations to leverage cyber threat intelligence to stay ahead of potential cyber attacks. Organizations across all industries are recognizing the importance of implementing robust threat intelligence solutions to stay ahead of cybercriminals and protect their valuable assets.</p><h2 id="the-role-of-threat-intelligence">The Role of Threat Intelligence</h2><p>Organizations need to be vigilant and proactive in their approach to security to protect sensitive information and maintain business continuity. And this is where <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence">threat intelligence</a> comes in. But what is threat intelligence?</p><p>Threat intelligence is the <strong>information an organization uses to understand the threats</strong> that have, will, or are targeting the organization. This intelligence is gathered from various sources such as <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/open-source-intelligence-definition">open sources (OSINT)</a>, social media, technical data, and <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/dark-web-monitoring">dark web monitoring</a>. The primary objective of threat intelligence is to provide actionable insights to prevent, detect, and respond to cyber threats.</p><br><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/what_is_threat_intelligence_definition_7bc657ef2e.webp" alt="What is Threat Intelligence?"></p><br><p>Threat intelligence can be broadly categorized into four main types:</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/strategic-threat-intelligence">Strategic threat intelligence</a></strong> - provides a high-level overview of the threat landscape, including emerging trends, geopolitical events, and major threat actors.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/tactical-threat-intelligence">Tactical threat intelligence</a></strong> - focuses on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by threat intelligence actors. </li><li><strong><a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/operational-threat-intelligence">Operational threat intelligence</a></strong> - more immediate and actionable, detailing specific incidents and campaigns that are currently active or imminent.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/technical-threat-intelligence">Technical threat intelligence</a></strong> - includes data on specific indicators of compromise (IOCs) such as IP addresses, domain names, file hashes, and malware signatures.</li></ul><p>By leveraging these various types of threat intelligence, organizations can build a comprehensive and layered defense against potential cyber threats.</p><h3 id="why-is-threat-intelligence-important">Why is Threat Intelligence Important?</h3><p>According to the <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/2024-data-breach-investigations-report-vulnerability-exploitation-boom-threatens-cybersecurity-1033310225">Markets Insider Report</a>, there was a staggering increase of 3 times invulnerability exploitation in 2023. This significant rise highlights the critical need for effective threat intelligence to protect sensitive information.</p><p>The importance of threat intelligence is that it converts raw data into meaningful information that security teams can use to make informed decisions. By understanding the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of the threat actors, organizations can defend better against potential attacks. Threat intelligence also helps in identifying <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/cyber-threats/emerging-threats">emerging threats</a>, prioritizing the latest vulnerabilities, and overall security posture.</p><h3 id="the-components-of-threat-intelligence">The Components of Threat Intelligence</h3><p>Effective threat intelligence is built on <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/intelligence-sources-collection/information-gathering">data gathering</a> and sophisticated analysis. It involves a multi-faceted approach that ensures the collected information is relevant, accurate, and actionable. Here are several key components:</p><ul><li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Gathering raw data from various sources, including network logs, security incidents, and external <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/intelligence-sources-collection/threat-intelligence-feeds">threat intel feeds</a>.</li><li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Processing and analyzing the collected data to identify patterns, trends, and indicators of potential threats.</li><li><strong>Dissemination:</strong> Sharing the analyzed intelligence with relevant stakeholders within the organization to inform security decisions and actions.</li><li><strong>Actionable Insights:</strong> Turning the analyzed data into actionable insights that can be used to mitigate risks and enhance security measures.</li></ul><h2 id="how-can-threat-intelligence-use-cases-help-organizations-against-cyber-threats">How Can Threat Intelligence Use Cases Help Organizations Against Cyber Threats?</h2><p>Threat intelligence plays a pivotal role in helping organizations defend against the ever-evolving landscape of emerging cyber threats. Because threat intelligence solutions can be used in a wide variety of ways, it is important to identify your potential use cases before you choose a <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com">threat intelligence platform</a>, rather than picking a solution and then trying to conform your use cases to the strengths of that solution.</p><p>Threat intelligence use cases can streamline the incident response process. In its recent <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/5037731">Market Guide</a>, the technology research company Gartner suggests that end users of cyber threat intelligence solutions identify their best solution by <strong>taking a use-case-centric approach</strong>.</p><p>For example, you may wish to gain insights into the identity, methods, and motives of threat actors targeting you so that you can avoid future threats and adjust or update your security; you may wish to create case studies for use in training exercises; or you may wish to gather more threat data so that you can <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/vulnerability-intelligence">prioritize vulnerability management based on the risks</a> that your organization is particularly vulnerable to  Gartner provides a long list of possible use cases that are important to consider before choosing a solution.</p><p>Before making expensive and informed security decisions on how to improve your security operations and programs, review Gartners five examples below on the most effective uses of threat intelligence platforms.</p><br><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/5_threat_intelligence_use_cases_f78bcb495e.webp" alt="Threat Intelligence Use Cases"></p><br><h3 id="1-enriching-other-security-technologies-by-integrating-threat-intelligence">1. Enriching Other Security Technologies by Integrating Threat Intelligence</h3><p>These are the basics  integrating cyber threat intelligence into your already existing security processes improves decision-making for incident response and enhances your security policy. According to Gartner, cyber threat intelligence has recently begun to be widely incorporated into most security technology verticals, including security information and event management (SIEM), firewalls and unified <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/integrations/threat-intelligence-management">threat management systems</a>, intrusion detection and prevention, secure web gateways and secure email gateways, endpoint protection, web application protection, distributed denial of service, vulnerability management, security orchestration, and more.</p><p>If your organization does not already include threat intelligence in its security program, a good place to start is by <strong>looking at what you are already using and seeing how threat intelligence can make it more effective</strong>. Many threat intelligence solutions offer machine-readable intelligence that can integrate frictionlessly with the security products you already use, and an increasing number of solutions are using open-source standards, making it easier than ever to share data across platforms.</p><h3 id="2-vulnerability-prioritization-for-security-teams">2. Vulnerability Prioritization For Security Teams</h3><p>One of the best uses for an effective <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/threat-intelligence-program">threat intelligence program</a> is to gather data and perform analysis that will help your organization create a simple metric for evaluating vulnerabilities. This metric should be a measure of the overlap between the problems you can fix and the solutions that will make the biggest difference, given the time and resources available to you.</p><p>The traditional approach to prioritizing vulnerabilities comes from the attitude that the best security approach is to patch everything, all the time, everywhere. Achieving this goal would, in theory, lead to a perfectly impenetrable system  but it sets an impossibly high standard. So organizations that follow this approach will inevitably make compromises and go after the biggest problems first.</p><p>But, contrary to popular belief, the biggest problems (based on how much damage they actually cause) are not issues like zero-day threats or clever new exploits, but the same old vulnerabilities that continue to be exploited, precisely because so many organizations prioritize new threats within their threat hunting instead of focusing on improving their fundamentals.</p><p><a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/threat-actors/threat-actor-types">Threat actors</a> are just as limited  if not more so  by time and the resources available to them as you are. They naturally will tend to use the simplest, least resource-intensive exploit as long as it continues to provide results.</p><p>In its analysis of vulnerabilities discovered over the last decade, Gartner found that <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/vulnerability-database">new CVEs</a> were found at a mostly steady rate, while the number of exploits grew exponentially over the same period. This indicates that the vast majority of new exploits were variations on old ones  making it clear that any organizations top priority should be patching already-known vulnerabilities rather than worrying about new threats.</p><h3 id="3-open-deep-and-dark-web-monitoring">3. Open, Deep, and Dark Web Monitoring</h3><p>A <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/threat-intelligence">threat intelligence solution</a> should gather its threat data from both open and closed sources on the internet.</p><p>Open sources, in short, are publicly available to everyone on the internet. This includes all the data that is indexed on search engines, which is sometimes called the surface web. Although this comprises some 4.56 billion pages, the public part of the internet only makes up about four percent of all data online.</p><p>The other 96 percent is divided between the deep web and the dark web. The deep web, which makes up about 90 percent of that data, refers to those parts of the internet that are locked away behind secure logins or paywalls, leaving them out of the reach of search engine crawlers. Most of this information includes scientific, academic, or government reports, personal information like financial records or medical histories, and private company databases.</p><p>The dark web, which makes up the remaining six percent of all the data on the internet, is made up of websites that can only be reached through browsers like Tor, which provide encryption and anonymity. Although this is not exclusively the case, many websites provide marketplaces for illegal goods and services.</p><p><a href="https://recordedfuture.com/cvss-score-vulnerabilities">Vulnerabilities and their exploits</a> are commonly discussed and traded in spaces on both the dark and deep web, both by parties that would wish to keep them safe, and by threat actors. That makes it essential to gather threat data from these <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/intelligence-sources-collection/threat-intelligence-sources">threat intelligence sources</a> to maintain a more comprehensive and up-to-date picture of what threats are out there.</p><p>Because accessing these spaces requires more skill and comes with higher risks, one of the principal values of certain threat intelligence solutions is that they will do it for you. According to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/5037731">Gartners Market Guide</a>, it can take many years of experience to effectively infiltrate these spaces and provide effective and timely analysis, and the most effective threat intelligence program will come with expert analysis that cannot be replicated by any algorithm.</p><h3 id="4-brand-monitoring">4. Brand Monitoring</h3><p>Although discussions about vulnerabilities and exploits will mostly take place in the closed parts of the internet, there is still great value in choosing an actionable threat intelligence platform that will monitor open sources as well, particularly for emerging <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/intelligence-sources-collection/social-media-threat-intelligence">cyber threats on social media channels</a>. Identifying threats in this arena is a skill in itself, requiring an awareness of your organizations brand and the many ways a threat actor may seek to exploit it.</p><p>Because these threats appear in public spaces and are subject to wider scrutiny, they can be more subtle, often relying on social engineering techniques instead of software exploits, and take a degree of expertise to recognize.</p><p>For example, a <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/brand-intelligence">threat intelligence solution that includes brand monitoring</a> may look for fake or malicious social media profiles that have been accepted by your staff or even mimic your staffs profiles, identify malicious links that have been posted to your social media profiles, or even evaluate intellectual property loss and theft.</p><p>Cyber attacks that can be identified through social media and brand monitoring include phishing, false flag schemes, domain fraud, or activist or trolling attacks. Professionally developed threat intelligence solutions are much more efficient and will generate fewer false positives than open-source tools or ad hoc approaches.</p><h3 id="5-threat-indicator-investigation-enrichment-and-response">5. Threat Indicator Investigation, Enrichment, and Response</h3><p>Not every attack can be prevented, of course, and one of the values of many threat intelligence solutions is their ability to improve the speed and accuracy of your incident response through operational threat intelligence. In its guide, Gartner advocates shifting away from focusing on prevention toward a more balanced approach that also equally includes both <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/incident-response-information">threat detection and response</a>.</p><p>Part of this framework includes rethinking how to prioritize vulnerabilities, as detailed above. It can also be helpful to have a threat intelligence solution that allows on-demand access to submit files or objects and looks for indicators of compromise like suspicious file hashes, domain names, or addresses, and compares them to the large datasets that some solutions maintain, enriching your organizations data.</p><p>Some solutions even have the ability to go on the hunt for threats proactively. Whereas incident response is, by definition, a reactive process, more advanced solutions can seek out threats before they are actually implemented against your organization.</p><p><a href="https://recordedfuture.com/blog/cyber-threat-hunting">Threat hunting</a> takes a mature organization that already maintains the fundamentals of its security stance, like keeping its systems up to date and closely monitoring its own network, but provides an invaluable additional layer of security for those organizations that can do it effectively.</p><h2 id="another-framework-for-evaluating-use-cases">Another Framework for Evaluating Use Cases</h2><p>Gartners Market Guide also provides an easy way to evaluate different threat intelligence services based on where they fall on two scales:</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/threat_intelligence_use_cases_1_ce5cbae3ff_29f1a5614a.webp" alt="Threat Intel Use Cases Examples by Time Frame or Type of Risk"></p><ul><li><strong>Tactical - Strategic</strong>: This scale is a measurement of time. In rough terms, a tactical threat intelligence solution may be more effective in the short term, while a strategic solution will be better in the long term. For example, a solution might be considered more tactical if its strengths lie in its ability to quickly process threat data and identify potential threats, whereas a solution that offers a deeper analysis that lends itself to long-term planning for the future could better be defined as strategic.</li><li><strong>Technical - Business</strong>: This scale is a measurement of risk type. In general terms, a technical threat intelligence solution will be more focused on security operations, while a strategic threat intelligence approach will deal with <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/solutions/digital-risk">digital risk management</a>. For example, a more technical solution might focus on indicators of immediate compromise like bad IP addresses or domains, but a solution that measures the risk from an emerging tactic or to a particular industry vertical is more aligned with business risk.</li></ul><h2 id="implementing-cyber-threat-intelligence-is-necessary">Implementing Cyber Threat Intelligence Is Necessary</h2><p>Incorporating threat intelligence into an organization&#39;s cybersecurity strategy is crucial for staying ahead of evolving cyber threats.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png"></p><p>Insikt Group&#39;s report reveals that CopyCop, a likely Russian government-aligned influence network, has shifted its focus to the 2024 US elections. Using AI and inauthentic websites, CopyCop creates and spreads political content. The network registered 120 new websites between May 10 and May 12, 2024, amplifying targeted content through platforms like YouTube. Despite a focus shift to US elections, CopyCop&#39;s AI-generated content has seen limited social media amplification. </p><p><strong>Russia-Linked CopyCop Expands to Cover US Elections, Target Political Leaders</strong></p><p>On May 9, 2024, Insikt Group published an <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/russia-linked-copycop-uses-llms-to-weaponize-influence-content-at-scale">initial report on CopyCop</a>, a likely Russian government-aligned influence network. CopyCop uses <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/russian-influence-network-doppelgangers-ai-content-tactics">inauthentic websites and generative artificial intelligence (AI)</a> to create and spread political content. Between May 10 and May 12, 2024, the network registered 120 new websites using similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). CopyCop has shifted its focus primarily to the 2024 United States (US) presidential election, disseminating targeted content through YouTube videos aimed at political leaders in France, Ukraine, and the European Union (EU).</p><p>CopyCop has expanded its sources for influence content to include mainstream news outlets in the US and UK, conservative-leaning US media, and Russian state-affiliated media. Within 24 hours of the original articles being posted, CopyCop scrapes, modifies, and disseminates them to US election-themed websites using over 1,000 fake journalist personas. Despite the rapid content generation, the AI-generated content has seen limited amplification on social media.</p><p>The network has adapted to recent scrutiny by moving its infrastructure to US-based hosts, likely to minimize Russian government connections. Additionally, fewer traces of generative AI use indicate an attempt to obscure the use of large language models (LLMs).</p><p><strong>Key Findings</strong></p><ul><li>CopyCop now targets the 2024 US elections, reducing content on other topics like <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/russias-war-against-ukraine-disrupts-cybercriminal-ecosystem">Russias war against Ukraine</a> and domestic politics in France and the UK.</li><li>CopyCop registered 120 new websites between May 10 and May 12, 2024, focusing on US elections.</li><li>The network uses AI-generated content and fake journalist personas to spread modified articles from mainstream and conservative-leaning US media, as well as Russian state-affiliated outlets.</li><li>New French-themed and US election websites are publishing targeted, likely human-crafted content.</li><li>As of early June 2024, CopyCop&#39;s new AI-generated content has seen little to no amplification on social media.</li><li>Over 1,000 distinct author profiles and LLM-generated text in article headlines indicate extensive use of AI.</li></ul><p><strong>Mitigations</strong></p><ul><li>Use <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform/intelligence-cloud">Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud</a> to track and summarize emerging narratives across CopyCop websites.</li><li>Monitor the spread of CopyCop content on social media and messaging platforms like Telegram.</li><li>News organizations should track and counteract plagiarized content to safeguard their reputation.</li><li>Utilize <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/brand-intelligence">Recorded Future Brand Intelligence</a> to identify and address typosquatting domains and infringing content.</li></ul><p>Influence networks using generative AI, like CopyCop, are likely to become more prominent ahead of the 2024 US elections, although they may not gain significant attention initially. Amplification of CopyCop content by existing influence networks is helping bring its content to existing audiences. Once these websites have established persistence, CopyCop will likely publish more targeted content hidden among the high volume of AI-generated content, making them harder to identify and parse out. To mitigate the impact, public organizations, news entities, and AI providers should proactively enforce sanctions, intellectual property laws, and terms of service before these networks gain traction and influence.</p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-ru-2024-0624.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Discover how RedJuliett, a Chinese state-sponsored group, targets Taiwan's government, academia, and tech sectors via network perimeter exploitation.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png"></p><p>From November 2023 to April 2024, Insikt Group identified cyber-espionage activities conducted by RedJuliett, a likely Chinese state-sponsored group, primarily targeting government, academic, technology, and diplomatic organizations in Taiwan. RedJuliett exploited known vulnerabilities in network edge devices such as firewalls, virtual private networks (VPNs), and load balancers for initial access. The group likely operates from Fuzhou, China, aligning with its persistent targeting of Taiwan. RedJulietts activities likely aim to support Beijing&#39;s <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/from-coercion-to-invasion-the-theory-and-execution-of-china-cyber-activity">intelligence collection</a> on Taiwans economic and diplomatic relations, as well as critical technology development. </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/Red_Juliett_infographic_02_8dada06f0b.jpg" alt="RedJuliett infographic-02.jpg"></p><p><strong>Chinese State-Sponsored RedJuliett Intensifies Cyber Espionage Against Taiwanese Government, Academic, and Technology Sectors</strong></p><p>RedJulietts focus on targeting Taiwanese entities aligns with the groups past activity. Insikt Group also observed RedJuliett expand its operations to compromise organizations in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Laos, South Korea, the United States, Djibouti, Kenya, and Rwanda.</p><p>In addition to targeting vulnerabilities in internet-facing devices, RedJuliett also used structured query language (SQL) injection and directory traversal exploits against web and SQL applications. Organizations should complement routine patching with defense-in-depth strategies focused on detecting post-exploitation persistence, discovery, and lateral movement activity to counter these threats. Organizations should also regularly audit internet-facing devices and reduce their attack surface where possible. RedJuliett closely overlaps with public reporting under the aliases Flax Typhoon and Ethereal Panda.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/Red_Juliett_infographic_01_1_03c33ce6d8.jpg" alt="RedJuliett infographic-01 (1).jpg"></p><p><strong>Key Findings</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Victim Organizations:</strong> RedJuliett compromised 24 organizations, including government organizations in Taiwan, Laos, Kenya, and Rwanda. The group also conducted network reconnaissance or attempted exploitation against over 70 academic, government, think tank, and technology organizations in Taiwan, as well as multiple de facto embassies operating on the island.</li><li><strong>Exploitation Techniques:</strong> RedJuliett created a SoftEther VPN bridge or client in victim networks. Additionally, the group conducted reconnaissance and attempted exploitation activity using Acunetix Web Application Security Scanners. RedJuliett also attempted SQL injection and directory traversal exploits against web and SQL applications. Post-exploitation, the group used open-source web shells and exploited an elevation of privilege vulnerability in the Linux operating system.</li><li><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> RedJuliett administers operational infrastructure using SoftEther VPN, leveraging both threat actor-controlled leased servers and compromised infrastructure belonging to Taiwanese universities.</li><li><strong>Implications for Taiwan:</strong> RedJuliett&#39;s activities align with Beijing&#39;s objectives to gather intelligence on Taiwans economic policy, trade, and diplomatic relations. The group also targeted multiple critical technology companies, highlighting the strategic importance of this sector for Chinese state-sponsored threat actors.</li></ul><p><strong>Recommendations for Organizations</strong></p><p>Organizations likely to be targeted by RedJuliett should adopt the following measures:</p><ol><li><strong>Network Segmentation:</strong> Practice network segmentation by isolating internet-facing services in a demilitarized zone (DMZ).</li><li><strong>Security Monitoring:</strong> Ensure security monitoring and detection capabilities for all external-facing services and devices. Monitor for follow-on activities such as the use of web shells, backdoors, or reverse shells and lateral movement within internal networks.</li><li><strong>Review Public Guidance:</strong> Review public guidance on mitigating common TTPs used by Chinese state-sponsored groups and Insikt Groups <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/charting-chinas-climb-leading-global-cyber-power">report</a> on trends and recommendations for mitigating Chinese APT activity more broadly.</li><li><strong>Risk-Based Patching:</strong> Ensure a risk-based approach for patching vulnerabilities, prioritizing high-risk vulnerabilities and those being exploited in the wild, as identified by <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/license-options/">Recorded Future Vulnerability Intelligence</a>.</li><li><strong>Prioritize RCE Vulnerabilities:</strong> Focus on addressing remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in popular VPN, mail server, firewall, and load-balancing appliances, particularly F5 BIG-IP, Fortinet FortiGate, and ZyXEL ZyWALL devices.</li><li><strong>Malicious Traffic Analysis:</strong> Monitor Malicious Traffic Analysis (MTA) to proactively detect and alert on infrastructure communicating with known RedJuliett command-and-control (C2) IP addresses.</li><li><strong>Monitor Supply Chains:</strong> <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/license-options/">Use Recorded Future Third-Party Intelligence</a> to monitor real-time output and identify suspected intrusion activities involving key vendors and partners.</li><li><strong>Threat Intelligence Extension:</strong> Install the <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform/browser-extension">Recorded Future Threat Intelligence Browser Extension</a> for instant access to threat intelligence from any web-based resource, enabling faster alert processing within security information and event management (SIEM) and prioritizing vulnerabilities for patching.</li></ol><p>Insikt Group anticipates that RedJuliett and other Chinese state-sponsored threat actors will continue to target Taiwan for intelligence-gathering, focusing on universities, government organizations, think tanks, and technology companies. Chinese state-sponsored groups are expected to continue their reconnaissance and exploitation of public-facing devices, a tactic that has proven effective in scaling their operations to gain initial access to a broad range of global targets. </p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-cn-2024-0624.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p><h2>Appendix A  Indicators of Compromise</h2><table><tbody><tr><td style="font-family:Courier New;background-color:#ffffff;"><strong>Active RedJuliett servers as of May 21, 2024:</strong><br>38.147.190[.]192 (since 2024-04-07)<br>61.238.103[.]155 (since 2024-02-23)<br>122.10.89[.]230 (since 2024-01-24)<br>137.220.36[.]87 (since 2024-05-09)<br>140.120.98[.]115 (since 2023-11-14)<br>154.197.98[.]3 (since 2023-11-14)<br>154.197.99[.]202 (since 2023-12-16)<br>176.119.150[.]92 (since 2024-04-01)<br>    <br><strong>Known RedJuliett SoftEther TLS Certificates (SHA-1 Fingerprint)</strong><br>7992c0a816246b287d991c4ecf68f2d32e4bca18<br>5437d0195c31bf7cedc9d90b8cb0074272bc55df<br>cc1f0cdc131dfafd43f60ff0e6a6089cd03e92f1<br>2c95b971aa47dc4d94a3c52db74a3de11d9ba658<br>0cc0ba859981e0c8142a4877f3af99d98dc0b707<br>9f01fc7cad8cdd8d934e2d2f033d7199a5e96e4a<br>    <br><strong>Domains:</strong><br>cktime.ooguy[.]com<br>www.sofeter[.]ml<br>www.dns361[.]tk<br></td></tr></tbody></table>            <p><br><br></p><h2>Appendix B  Mitre ATT&CK Techniques</h2><table>  <tr>   <td style="background-color:#0071CE;color:#ffffff;font-weight: 700;"><strong>Tactic: Technique</strong></td>   <td style="background-color:#0071CE;color:#ffffff;font-weight: 700;"><strong>ATT&CK Code</strong></td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td><strong>Resource Development:</strong> Acquire Infrastructure: Virtual Private Server</td>   <td><a href="https://app.recordedfuture.com/live/sc/entity/mitre:T1583.003">T1583.003</a></td>  </tr>    <tr>   <td><strong>Resource Development:</strong> Compromise Infrastructure: Server</td>   <td><a href="https://app.recordedfuture.com/live/sc/entity/mitre:T1584">T1584</a></td>  </tr>    <tr>   <td><strong>Reconnaissance:</strong> Active Scanning: Vulnerability Scanning</td>   <td><a href="https://app.recordedfuture.com/live/sc/entity/mitre:T1595.002">T1595.002</a></td>  </tr>    <tr>   <td><strong>Initial Access:</strong> Exploit Public-Facing Application</td>   <td><a href="https://app.recordedfuture.com/live/sc/entity/mitre:T1190">T1190</a></td>  </tr>    <tr>   <td><strong>Persistence:</strong> External Remote Services</td>   <td><a href="https://app.recordedfuture.com/live/sc/entity/mitre:T1133">T1133</a></td>  </tr>    <tr>   <td><strong>Persistence:</strong> Server Software Component: Web Shell</td>   <td><a href="https://app.recordedfuture.com/live/sc/entity/mitre:T1505.003">T1505.003</a></td>  </tr>    <tr>   <td><strong>Privilege Escalation:</strong> Exploitation for Privilege Escalation</td>   <td><a href="https://app.recordedfuture.com/live/sc/entity/mitre:T1068">T1068</a></td>  </tr></table>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) is the practice of gathering, analyzing, and disseminating information from publicly available sources to address specific intelligence requirements</strong>.</p><p>Of all the <a href="https://recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence">threat intelligence</a> subtypes, open source intelligence (OSINT) is perhaps the most widely used, which makes sense. After all, its mostly free, and who can say no to that?</p><p>Unfortunately, much like the other major subtypes  human intelligence, signals intelligence, and geospatial intelligence, to name a few  open source intelligence is widely misunderstood and misused.</p><p>This widespread use and the growing sophistication of OSINT are reflected in market projections. In fact, according to a <a href="https://futuremarketinsights.com/reports/open-source-intelligence-market">report</a> by Future Market Insikt, the OSINT industry is predicted to reach a staggering $58 billion by 2033, highlighting its increasing importance and integration into various sectors.</p><p>If you have ever asked yourself What does OSINT stand for? What is open source intelligence (OSINT)? Or whats the OSINT meaning? Keep reading to find out.</p><p>In this blog post, were going to cover <strong>the fundamentals of Open Source Intelligence, or OSINT</strong>, including how its used, and the <a href="https://recordedfuture.com/blog/tactical-threat-intelligence">tools and techniques</a> that can be employed to gather and analyze it. Well delve into what is OSINT, exploring the OSINT meaning and the significant role it plays in the realm of intelligence gathering.</p><h2 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h2><ul><li><strong>Open source intelligence is derived from data and information that is available to the general public</strong>. Its not limited to what can be found using Google, although the so-called surface web is an important component.</li><li><strong>As valuable as open source intelligence can be, information overload is a real concern</strong>. Most of the tools and techniques used to conduct open source intelligence initiatives are designed to help security professionals (or threat actors) focus their efforts on specific areas of interest.</li><li><strong>There is a dark side to open source intelligence: anything that can be found by security professionals can also be found (and used) by threat actors</strong>.</li><li><strong>Having a clear strategy and framework in place for open source intelligence gathering is essential</strong>  simply looking for anything that could be interesting or useful will inevitably lead to burnout.</li><li><strong>Using OSINT tools to discover and protect sensitive data from potential attackers is crucial</strong> to reduce the risk of cybersecurity threats.</li></ul><h2 id="osint-meaning">OSINT Meaning</h2><p>Before we look at common sources and applications of open source intelligence, its important to understand what it actually is.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title50/html/USCODE-2011-title50-chap15-subchapI-sec403-5.htm">According</a> to U.S. public law, open source intelligence:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Is produced from publicly available information</strong></li><li><strong>Is collected, analyzed, and disseminated in a timely manner to an appropriate audience</strong></li><li><strong>Addresses a specific intelligence requirement</strong></li></ul><p>The important phrase to focus on here is publicly available.</p><p><strong>The term open source refers specifically to information that is available for public consumption</strong>. If any specialist skills, tools, or techniques are required to access a piece of information, it cant reasonably be considered open source.</p><br><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/what_is_osint_definition_0d760cc7c0.webp" alt="What is OSINT? (Open Source Intelligence)"></p><br><p>Crucially, open source information is not limited to what you can find using the major search engines. Web pages and other resources that can be found using Google certainly constitute massive sources of open source information, but they are far from the only sources.</p><p>For starters, a huge proportion of the internet (<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=_V8MGzvJEXY">over 99 percent, according to former Google CEO Eric Schmidt</a>) cannot be found using the major search engines. This so-called deep web is a mass of websites, databases, files, and more that (for a variety of reasons, including the <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/dangers-of-exposed-login-panels">presence of login pages</a> or paywalls) cannot be indexed by Google, Bing, Yahoo, or any other search engine you care to think of. Despite this, much of the content of the deep web can be considered open source because its readily available to the public.</p><p><strong>OSINT tools can be used to access and analyze information from sources beyond traditional search engines</strong>. These tools, such as Spiderfoot, searchcode, Searx, Twint, and Metagoofil, gather and analyze massive amounts of data from public and open sources, including social media networks and the deep web, to discover and store large quantities of data, find links and patterns among different pieces of information, and collate discovered information into actionable intelligence.</p><p>In addition, <strong>theres plenty of freely accessible information online that can be found using online tools other than traditional search engines</strong>. Well look at this more later on, but as a simple example, tools like <a href="https://securitytrails.com/">SecurityTrails</a> and others can be used to find IP addresses, networks, open ports, webcams, printers, and pretty much anything else thats connected to the internet.</p><p><strong>Information can also be considered open source if it is:</strong></p><ul><li>Published or broadcast for a public audience (for example, news media content)</li><li>Available to the public by request (for example, census data)</li><li>Available to the public by subscription or purchase (for example, industry journals)</li><li>Could be seen or heard by any casual observer</li><li>Made available at a meeting open to the public</li><li>Obtained by visiting any place or attending any event that is open to the public</li></ul><p>At this point, youre probably thinking, Man, thats a lot of information </p><p>And youre right. Were talking about a truly unimaginable quantity of information that is growing at a far higher rate than anybody could ever hope to keep up with. Even if we narrow the field down to a single source of information  lets say Twitter  were forced to cope with <a href="http://internetlivestats.com/">hundreds of millions of new data points every day</a>.</p><p>This, as youve probably gathered, is the inherent trade-off of open source intelligence.</p><h2 id="history-of-osint">History of OSINT</h2><p>The term OSINT refers to the practice of collecting information from <a href="https://osintfoundation.com/osint/Standards.asp">publicly available sources</a> to be used in an intelligence context. This practice has been around for a while, but its the digital era that really propelled OSINT into a league of its own.</p><p><strong>The foundational roots of OSINT are linked to the formation of the <a href="https://cia.gov/readingroom/sites/default/files/FBIS_history_part1_0.pdf">Foreign Broadcast Monitoring Service (FBMS) back in 1941</a></strong>. This organization was charged with the significant role of scrutinizing international broadcast communications to identify any potential dubious activities.</p><p><a href="https://afio.com/publications/Schauer_Storger_Evo_of_OSINT_WINTERSPRING2013.pdf">According</a> to the Association of Former Intelligence Officers (AFIO): <strong>The US military first coined the term OSINT in the late 1980s.</strong> This development stemmed from the recognition that intelligence reform was needed to effectively meet the rapidly changing informational demands, particularly at the tactical battlefield level.</p><p>Initially, OSINT was a tool used primarily by intelligence agencies and law enforcement to gather publicly available information to assist in national security and <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/threat-actors/cybercriminals">cybercriminal</a> investigations. The methods involved were time-consuming, often requiring individuals to manually sift through public records, newspapers, and other documents to find relevant information. This manual gathering of information was often difficult due to the vast amount of data one had to sift through. However, <strong>as the web evolved, so did the methods of collecting and analyzing publicly available data</strong>.</p><p>The advent of the internet significantly amplified the means through which information could be collected. <strong>Suddenly, a wide range of data became publicly available and easily accessible online, from government reports to academic papers, and everything in-between</strong>. Websites became a primary data source for OSINT practitioners. These developments led to a boom in the creation of <a href="https://recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/tools-and-technologies/osint-tools">OSINT tools</a> designed to automate the process of data collection and analysis. These tools could quickly gather information from various sources, including publicly accessible databases, social media platforms, and many other tools available in the digital realm.</p><p><strong>As the field of cybersecurity experienced rapid growth, the application of OSINT expanded. Cybersecurity professionals began to see the value in utilizing OSINT to identify vulnerabilities, assess potential security threats, and bolster organizational security</strong>. OSINT tools became essential in monitoring publicly accessible web servers, analyzing metadata, and assessing security vulnerabilities. The data gathered became invaluable in understanding the security posture of an organization, identifying potential threats, and developing strategies to mitigate risks.</p><p>One notable trend is <strong>the integration of machine learning and analytics in OSINT tools to enhance the process of identifying patterns and trends from the collected data</strong>. This integration has not only made OSINT tools more effective but has also expanded the range of applications in which they can be utilized. For instance, security researchers now use OSINT to perform penetration tests, while businesses use it to gain insights into their competitors and the market environment.</p><p>Moreover, <strong>the community of OSINT researchers has grown over time, with forums, conferences, and groups forming to share knowledge, discuss best practices, and develop new OSINT techniques</strong>. Many OSINT tools, including frameworks like Recon-ng, have communities of developers on platforms like GitHub, working to improve, customize, and create modules to extend the capabilities of these tools. The collective effort of these communities has played a significant role in refining the OSINT practice, making it a vital component in intelligence gathering and cybersecurity.</p><h2 id="how-is-open-source-intelligence-used">How Is Open Source Intelligence Used?</h2><p>Now that weve covered the basics of open source intelligence, we can look at <a href="https://recordedfuture.com/blog/open-source-intelligence-future">how it is commonly used for cybersecurity</a>. The intelligence community plays a crucial role in utilizing OSINT for national security and cybersecurity efforts. </p><br><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/osint_how_is_open_source_intelligence_used_991120581e.webp" alt="How is Open Source Intelligence Used?"></p><br><p>There are two common use cases:</p><h3 id="1-ethical-hacking-and-penetration-testing">1. Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing</h3><p>Security professionals use open source intelligence to identify potential weaknesses in friendly networks so that they can be remediated before they are exploited by threat actors. Commonly found weaknesses include:</p><ul><li>Accidental leaks of sensitive data, like through <a href="https://recordedfuture.com/blog/social-media-threat-intelligence">social media</a>. Identifying and protecting sensitive data is crucial to reduce the risk of cybersecurity threats.</li><li>Open ports or unsecured internet-connected devices</li><li>Unpatched software, such as websites running old versions of common CMS products</li><li>Leaked or exposed assets, such as proprietary code on pastebins</li></ul><h3 id="2-identifying-external-threats">2. Identifying External Threats</h3><p>As weve discussed many times in the past, the internet is an excellent source of insights into an organizations most pressing <a href="https://recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/cyber-threats/emerging-threats">emerging threats</a>. From identifying which new <a href="https://recordedfuture.com/blog/exploiting-old-vulnerabilities">vulnerabilities are being actively exploited</a> to intercepting threat actor chatter about an upcoming attack, open source intelligence enables security professionals to prioritize their time and resources to address the most significant current threats.</p><p>In most cases, this type of work requires an analyst to identify and correlate multiple data points to validate a threat before action is taken. OSINT tools are used to gather and analyze data from public and open sources, including social media networks and the deep web, to identify and correlate multiple data points for threat validation. For example, while a single threatening tweet may not be cause for concern, that same tweet would be viewed in a different light if it were tied to a threat group known to be active in a specific industry.</p><p>One of the most important things to understand about open source intelligence is that it is often used in combination with other intelligence subtypes. Intelligence from closed sources such as internal telemetry, closed <a href="https://recordedfuture.com/blog/dark-web-networks">dark web communities</a>, and external intelligence-sharing communities is regularly used to filter and verify open source intelligence. There are a variety of tools available to help analysts perform these functions, which well look at a bit later on.</p><h2 id="the-dark-side-of-open-source-intelligence">The Dark Side of Open Source Intelligence</h2><p>At this point, its time to address the second major issue with open source intelligence: <strong>if something is readily available to intelligence analysts, its also readily available to threat actors.</strong></p><p><strong>Threat actors use open source intelligence tools and techniques to identify potential targets and exploit weaknesses in target networks.</strong> Once a vulnerability is identified, it is often an <a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-i-hacked-40-websites-in-7-minutes-5b4c28bc8824">extremely quick and simple process</a> to exploit it and achieve a variety of malicious objectives. They also seek out sensitive data that can be exploited for malicious purposes, such as launching targeted attacks or selling the information on the dark web.</p><p>This process is the main reason why so many small and medium-sized enterprises get hacked each year. It isnt because threat groups specifically take an interest in them, but rather because vulnerabilities in their network or website architecture are found using simple open source intelligence techniques. In short, they are easy targets.</p><p>And open source intelligence doesnt only enable technical attacks on IT systems and networks. <strong>Different <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/threat-actors/threat-actor-types">types of threat actors</a> also seek out information about individuals and organizations that can be used to inform sophisticated social engineering campaigns using <a href="https://recordedfuture.com/blog/podcast-episode-31">phishing</a> (email), vishing (phone or voicemail), and SMiShing (SMS).</strong> Often, seemingly innocuous information shared through social networks and blogs can be used to develop highly convincing social engineering campaigns, which in turn are used to trick well-meaning users into compromising their organizations network or assets.</p><p>This is why using open source intelligence for security purposes is so important  It gives you an opportunity to find and fix weaknesses in your organizations network and remove sensitive information <em>before</em> a threat actor uses the same tools and techniques to exploit them.</p><h2 id="open-source-intelligence-techniques-and-osint-tools">Open Source Intelligence Techniques and OSINT Tools</h2><p>Now that weve covered the uses of open source intelligence (both good and bad) its time to look at some of the techniques that can be used to gather and process open source information.</p><br><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/osint_techniques_c41b559086.webp" alt="OSINT Techniques"></p><br><p>First, <strong>you must have a clear strategy and <a href="https://recordedfuture.com/blog/analytical-threat-intelligence-frameworks">framework</a> in place for acquiring and using open source intelligence. Its not recommended to approach open source intelligence from the perspective of finding anything and everything that might be interesting or useful</strong>  as weve already discussed, the sheer volume of information available through open sources will simply overwhelm you.</p><p>It is also crucial to select the right OSINT tool for your specific intelligence gathering goals. These tools, such as Spiderfoot, searchcode, Searx, Twint, and Metagoofil, can help discover and store large quantities of data, find links and patterns among different pieces of information, and collate discovered information into actionable intelligence.</p><p>Instead, <strong>you must know exactly what youre trying to achieve</strong>  for example, to identify and remediate weaknesses in your network  and focus your energies specifically on accomplishing those goals.</p><p>Second, <strong>you must identify a set of tools and techniques for collecting and processing open source information</strong>. Once again, the volume of information available is much too great for manual processes to be even slightly effective.</p><h3 id="passive-vs-active-osint">Passive vs. Active OSINT</h3><p>Broadly speaking, collection of open source intelligence falls into two categories: passive collection and active collection.</p><p><strong>Passive collection</strong> often involves the use of <a href="https://recordedfuture.com/blog/threat-intelligence-platform">threat intelligence platforms (TIPs)</a> to combine a variety of <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/intelligence-sources-collection/threat-intelligence-feeds">threat feeds</a> into a single, easily accessible location. While this is a major step up from manual intelligence harvesting, the risk of information overload is still significant.</p><p>More advanced threat intelligence solutions like Recorded Future solve this problem by using artificial intelligence, <a href="https://recordedfuture.com/blog/machine-learning-threat-intelligence">machine learning</a>, and natural language processing to automate the process of prioritizing and dismissing alerts based on an organizations specific needs. Additionally, using an OSINT tool can further streamline this process by gathering and analyzing massive amounts of data from public and open sources, <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/intelligence-sources-collection/social-media-threat-intelligence">including social media networks</a> and the deep web.</p><p>In a similar manner, organized threat groups often use botnets to collect valuable information using techniques like traffic sniffing and keylogging.</p><p><strong>Active collection</strong> is the use of a variety of techniques to search for specific insights or information. For security professionals, this type of collection work is usually done for one of two reasons:</p><ol><li>A passively collected alert has highlighted a potential threat and further insight is required.</li><li>The focus of an intelligence gathering exercise is very specific, such as a penetration testing exercise.</li></ol><p>To close things out, well take a look at some of the most commonly used tools for collecting and processing open source intelligence.</p><p>While there are many free and useful tools available to security professionals and threat actors alike, <strong>some of the most commonly used (and abused) open source intelligence tools are search engines like Google</strong>  just not as most of us know them.</p><p>As weve already explained, <strong>one of the biggest issues facing security professionals is the regularity with which normal, well-meaning users accidentally leave sensitive assets and information exposed to the internet</strong>. There are a series of advanced search functions called <a href="https://recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/threat-analysis-techniques/google-dorks">Google dork</a> queries that can be used to identify the information and assets they expose.</p><p>Google dork queries are based on the search operators used by IT professionals and hackers on a daily basis to conduct their work. Common examples include filetype:, which narrows search results to a specific file type, and site:, which only returns results from a specified website or domain.</p><p>The Public Intelligence website offers a <a href="https://publicintelligence.net/feds-google-dorking">more thorough rundown of Google dork queries</a>, in which they give the following example search:</p><p><em>sensitive but unclassified filetype:pdf site:publicintelligence.net</em></p><p>If you type this search term into a search engine, it returns only PDF documents from the <a href="http://publicintelligence.net/">Public Intelligence website</a> that contain the words sensitive but unclassified somewhere in the document text. As you can imagine, with hundreds of commands at their disposal, security professionals and threat actors can use similar techniques to search for almost anything.</p><p>Moving beyond search engines, there are literally hundreds of tools that can be used to identify network weaknesses or exposed assets. For example, you can use<a href="https://wappalyzer.com/"> Wappalyzer</a> to identify which technologies are used on a website, and combine the results with<a href="https://sploitus.com/"> Sploitus</a> or the <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/">National Vulnerability Database</a> to determine whether any relevant vulnerabilities exist. Taking things a step further, you could use a more advanced threat intelligence solution like Recorded Future to determine whether any <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/vulnerability-database">recent vulnerabilities</a> are being actively exploited, or included in any active exploit kits.</p><h2 id="osint-faq">OSINT FAQ</h2><h3 id="is-osint-legal">Is OSINT legal?</h3><p>Yes, OSINT is generally legal since it involves <a href="https://recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/intelligence-sources-collection/information-gathering">gathering information</a> that is publicly available. However, the legality can become a gray area depending on how the information is used or if attempts are made to access restricted or private data under the guise of OSINT. It is crucial to ensure that while gathering information, sensitive data is protected to prevent it from being exploited by attackers.</p><h3 id="what-is-the-dark-side-of-osint">What is the dark side of OSINT?</h3><p>The dark side of OSINT emerges when sensitive data is gathered and misused for malicious purposes. This can include stalking, harassment, doxxing, or even planning cyber-attacks. While OSINT itself is a valuable tool for many positive uses, like any tool, it can be misused in the wrong hands.</p><h3 id="how-is-osint-utilized-to-gather-intelligence-from-the-dark-web-and-what-precautions-should-be-taken">How is OSINT utilized to gather intelligence from the dark web, and what precautions should be taken?</h3><p>OSINT is employed to uncover hidden services and forums on the dark web, aiding in <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/incident-response-management/cyber-crime-investigation">cybercrime investigations</a> or threat detection. The use of OSINT tools, such as Spiderfoot and Twint, is crucial in uncovering and analyzing data from these hidden sources. However, venturing into the dark web requires precautions:</p><ol><li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> Ensure actions comply with legal and ethical guidelines.</li><li><strong>Privacy Protection:</strong> Avoid infringing on individual privacy.</li><li><strong>Secure Browsing:</strong> Use tools like Tor for secure browsing.</li><li><strong>Malware Protection:</strong> Employ robust malware protection to guard against malicious software.</li><li><strong>Data Verification:</strong> Verify the accuracy of the information collected through multiple sources.</li></ol><p>These measures help ensure the safe and lawful use of OSINT in gathering intelligence from the dark web.</p><h2 id="start-with-the-end-in-mind">Start With the End in Mind</h2><p>The most important factor in the success of any open source intelligence initiative is the presence of a clear strategy  once you know what youre trying to accomplish and youve set objectives accordingly, identifying the most useful tools and techniques will be much more achievable.</p><p>To learn more about how Recorded Future can help organizations better understand and prevent threats, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/demo?utm_campaign=rf-blog-bottom-book-a-demo-text-cta&utm_source=recordedfuture&utm_medium=webiste&utm_content=rf-blog-bottom-book-a-demo-text-cta&utm_term=rf-blog-bottom-book-a-demo-text-cta">request a personalized demo</a> today.</p><p><em>This article was originally published February 19, 2019, and last updated on Jun 24, 2024.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

Its high 90% commission rate attracts seasoned affiliates, leading to a surge in infections. RansomHub&#39;s affiliates have impacted 45 victims across eighteen countries, primarily targeting the IT sector. The ransomware leverages cloud storage backups and misconfigured Amazon S3 instances to extort victims. Insikt Group identified code overlaps with ALPHV and Knight Ransomware, suggesting potential connections. Immediate and long-term security measures are recommended for organizations.</p><p><strong>RansomHub Draws in Affiliates with Multi-OS Capability and High Commission Rates</strong></p><p>RansomHub is a new ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) first advertised in early February 2024. First advertised by a user named koley on the underground forum Ramp, RansomHub has quickly drawn attention due to its versatile malware written in Go and C++. This ransomware targets Windows, Linux, and ESXi systems, a feature that significantly expands the range of potential victims. Such multi-OS targeting aligns with a broader trend where malware designed to attack various operating systems increased sevenfold between 2022 and 2023.</p><p><a href="https://therecord.media/christies-cyberattack-ransomhub-claims">RansomHub</a> offers affiliates a 90% commission rate, which is on the higher end of the typical 80-90% range seen in the RaaS market. This lucrative rate is likely to attract seasoned affiliates from other platforms, leading to a surge in RansomHub-related infections and victims.</p><p>Since its launch, RansomHub has claimed 45 victims across 18 countries, with the IT sector being the most frequently targeted. This pattern suggests that RansomHubs affiliates are engaging in big game hunting, where attackers focus on high-value targets that are more likely to pay substantial ransoms due to the severe financial implications of operational downtime.</p><p>In one notable incident, RansomHub affiliates leveraged <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/your-aws-presence-growing-attack-surface-faster">misconfigured Amazon S3 instances</a> to access backups not only of their primary target but also of other clients using the same backup provider. This tactic allowed them to extort the backup solutions provider by threatening to leak client data, exploiting the trust relationship between providers and their clients. Recently, RansomHub gained attention for selling 4TB of data stolen from Change Healthcare, a US-based healthcare technology company.</p><p>Insikt Groups analysis revealed code overlaps between RansomHub and other ransomware groups, such as <a href="https://therecord.media/an-alphv-blackcat-representative-discusses-the-groups-plans-for-a-ransomware-meta-universe">ALPHV (BlackCat)</a> and Knight Ransomware. These similarities suggest possible connections or shared resources among these groups. RansomHubs strategy of using passwords to decrypt embedded configurations makes it challenging for threat researchers to analyze the malware dynamically.</p><p>RansomHubs ESXi version employs a unique tactic by creating a file named <em>/tmp/app.pid</em> to prevent multiple instances from running simultaneously. Modifying this file can halt the ransomwares operations, presenting a potential mitigation strategy for affected systems.</p><p><strong>Mitigations</strong></p><p>Insikt Group has created YARA and Sigma rules that can be used to detect the presence or execution of RansomHub ransomware files in your environment. These rules cover ESXi, Linux, and Windows variants. Additionally, analysts can search endpoint logging for command-line invocations used by RansomHub to stop virtual machines (VMs), delete shadow copies, and stop the Internet Information Service (IIS) service.</p><ul><li><em>powershell.exe -Command PowerShell -Command &quot;&quot;Get-VM | Stop-VM -Force&quot;&quot;</em></li><li><em>cmd.exe /c iisreset.exe /stop</em></li><li><em>powershell.exe -Command PowerShell -Command &quot;&quot;Get-CimInstance Win32_ShadowCopy | Remove-CimInstance&quot;&quot;</em></li></ul><p>In addition to the above detections, the following general recommendations should be followed to <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/solutions/ransomware">reduce the risk of ransomware infections</a> effectively</p><ul><li><strong>Network Isolation:</strong> Segment your network to limit ransomware&#39;s lateral movement.</li><li><strong>SIEM:</strong> Implement Security Information and Event Management for centralized logging and detection.</li><li><strong>Endpoint Detection:</strong> Use Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) services with YARA and Sigma rules.</li><li><strong>Least Privilege Access:</strong> Implement least privilege access and multi-factor authentication for remote access services.</li><li><strong>Data Backup and Recovery:</strong> Regularly back up data and store backups offline or in isolated segments.</li><li><strong>Evaluate Solutions Providers:</strong> Collaborate with providers for consistent system audits.</li><li><strong>Patch Management:</strong> Keep all applications and operating systems up to date with the latest patches and updates.</li><li><strong>Recorded Future Hunting Packages:</strong> Implement YARA and Sigma rules like the ones found in Recorded Future Hunting Packages to identify malware via signature-based detection or Snort rules for endpoint-based detections.</li></ul><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/mtp-2024-0620.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>]]></content:encoded>
