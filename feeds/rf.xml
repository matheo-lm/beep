            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="langflow-cve-2025-3248">Langflow: CVE-2025-3248</h2><h3 id="what-is-cve-2025-3248">What is CVE-2025-3248?</h3><p><a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/vulnerability-database/CVE-2025-3248">CVE-2025-3248</a> is a critical missing authentication vulnerability affecting Langflow versions before 1.3.0. Langflow is a widely used tool for building and deploying AI-powered agents and workflows. On May 5, 2025, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/">CISA</a>) also added CVE-2025-3248 to its <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog">Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog</a>. Exploiting the vulnerability can allow remote, unauthenticated attackers to send crafted HTTP requests and execute arbitrary code by abusing Python decorators and default arguments. </p><p>Given the high risk associated with this vulnerability and ongoing exploitation attempts, it is imperative to prioritize patching CVE-2025-3248 on your company&#39;s assets to prevent unauthorized access and attackers potentially taking control of affected systems.</p><h4 id="insikt-groups-assessment-of-cve-2025-3248">Insikt Groups Assessment of CVE-2025-3248</h4><p>CVE-2025-3248 arises from Langflows failure to implement appropriate input sanitization and execution control at the &quot;<span style="font-family:courier;">/api/v1/validate/code</span>&quot; endpoint, where it insecurely uses Pythons &quot;<span style="font-family:courier;">compile</span>&quot; and &quot;<span style="font-family:courier;">exec()</span>&quot; function to process user-supplied code. Specifically, the vulnerability results from Langflows approach of validating function definitions by parsing them into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and executing specific components.</p><p>The endpoint parses the user-submitted code field using &quot;<span style="font-family:courier;">ast.parse()</span>&quot; to construct an AST. Langflow then uses Pythons compile function to convert the parsed AST into executable bytecode. During AST processing, Python evaluates argument default values and decorators immediately upon compilation. This evaluation occurs when the AST node representing the function is processed, not strictly during the <span style="font-family:courier;">ast.parse()</span> step. If these components contain malicious payloads, they are executed as part of the compilation and execution phase.</p><p>Unauthenticated attackers can therefore craft malicious payloads embedded within argument defaults or decorators. Since Langflow does not enforce input validation or sandboxing, these payloads are compiled and executed within the server context, leading to remote code execution (RCE). In vulnerable versions, remote threat actors can submit specially crafted POST requests to the endpoint, potentially deploying reverse shell commands, data exfiltration scripts, or other malicious code without authentication or adequate restriction.</p><p>At the time of writing, there were 1,050 exposed Langflow instances on Shodan. However, not all of these are necessarily vulnerable as their specific versions are unknown. Additionally, cybersecurity firm Greynoise observed 361 malicious IP addresses attempting to exploit CVE-2025-3248, primarily targeting systems in the US, Australia, Singapore, Germany, and Mexico.</p><table>  <tr>    <th>Malicious IP Address</th>    <th>Source Location</th>    <th>Target Location</th>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>45.33.95[.]165</td>    <td>US</td>    <td>Germany, Singapore, UK, India, US, Netherlands, Canada, Australia, France, Bahrain, Brazil, Italy, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, South Korea, Thailand, Finland, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Israel, UAE, Belgium, Malaysia, Taiwan</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>3.35.37[.]70</td>    <td>South Korea</td>    <td>France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Netherlands, US</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>139.59.223[.]9</td>    <td>Singapore</td>    <td>Lithuania</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>35.221.194[.]209</td>    <td>Taiwan</td>    <td>Germany</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>204.216.147[.]144</td>    <td>Brazil</td>    <td>Taiwan, Turkey</td>  </tr></table><p><em><strong>Table 1:</strong> Example malicious IP addresses attempting to exploit CVE-2025-3248 (Source: <a href="https://viz.greynoise.io/query/CVE-2025-3248%20tags:%22Langflow%20Code%20Injection%20CVE-2025-3248%20RCE%20Attempt%22">Greynoise</a>)</em></p><p>Multiple proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits were also shared on GitHub; public PoC exploits often increase the likelihood of continued active exploitation.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt group logo"></p><p><em>Note: The analysis cut-off date for this report was March 24, 2025.</em></p><h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2><p>From January to February 2025, Insikt Group detected a phishing campaign targeting Tajikistan that Insikt Group attributes to TAG-110, a Russia-aligned threat actor that overlaps with UAC-0063 and has been linked to APT28 (BlueDelta) with medium confidence by CERT-UA. In this campaign, TAG-110 leveraged Tajikistan government-themed documents as lure material, consistent with its historical use of trojanized legitimate government documents, though the authenticity of the current samples could not be independently verified. These documents were distinct from those used in previous campaigns (<a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/russia-aligned-tag-110-targets-asia-and-europe">1</a>, <a href="https://www.bitdefender.com/en-us/blog/businessinsights/uac-0063-cyber-espionage-operation-expanding-from-central-asia">2</a>, <a href="https://cert.gov.ua/article/6280129">3</a>, <a href="https://blog.sekoia.io/double-tap-campaign-russia-nexus-apt-possibly-related-to-apt28-conducts-cyber-espionage-on-central-asia-and-kazakhstan-diplomatic-relations/">4</a>), notably lacking an embedded <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/ms536495(v=vs.85)">HTA</a>-based payload HATVIBE within them, which TAG-110 has deployed since at least 2023. In this campaign, TAG-110 has shifted to using macro-enabled Word template files (.dotm files) rather than HATVIBE for the initial payload. Given TAG-110s historical targeting of public sector entities in Central Asia, this campaign is likely targeting government, educational, and research institutions within Tajikistan.</p><p>Russias Central Asian policy centers on preserving a postSoviet sphere of influence by embedding itself at the core of the regions security, economic, and political architecture. TAG-110&#39;s activities continue to bolster this policy through intelligence-gathering operations. Insikt Group anticipates TAG110 will sustain regional operations against government ministries, academic and research bodies, and diplomatic missions, particularly those involved in upcoming elections, military operations, or other events the Kremlin wishes to influence.</p><h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2><ul><li>TAG-110 has changed its spearphishing tactics in recent campaigns against Tajikistan, as they now rely on macro-enabled Word templates (.dotm files).</li><li>This campaign has been attributed to TAG-110 based on its reuse of VBA code found in lures from previous campaigns, overlap in C2 infrastructure, and use of suspected legitimate government documents for lure material.</li><li>TAG-110s persistent targeting of Tajik government, educational, and research institutions supports Russias strategy to maintain influence in Central Asia. These cyber-espionage operations likely aim to gather intelligence for influencing regional politics or security, particularly during sensitive events like elections or geopolitical tensions.</li><li>TAG-110s recent use of macro-enabled Word templates (.dotm), placed in the Microsoft Word STARTUP folder for automatic execution, highlights a tactical evolution prioritizing persistence. Organizations should monitor the Word STARTUP directory for unauthorized additions and enforce strict macro security policies.</li></ul><h2 id="background">Background</h2><p>TAG-110 is a Russia-aligned threat actor overlapping with UAC-0063, which has been linked to APT28 (BlueDelta) with medium confidence by CERT-UA. TAG-110 has conducted cyber-espionage campaigns primarily targeting Central Asia since <a href="https://cert.gov.ua/article/4697016?fbclid=IwAR1B5gj0v-Ve9Q5299ydM5lrInLuKVmvPRosQkUucq6YzcjuTgVnM_x3LjQ">at least 2021</a>. Historically, this group has been known for its use of macro-enabled Word documents to deliver malicious payloads such as HATVIBE, an HTA-based malware designed for initial access and persistence. In November 2024, Insikt Group <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/russia-aligned-tag-110-targets-asia-and-europe">highlighted</a> TAG-110s use of HTA-embedded spearphishing attachments in emails tailored for Central Asian diplomatic entities. TAG-110s operations have been documented by organizations such as <a href="https://cert.gov.ua/article/4697016?fbclid=IwAR1B5gj0v-Ve9Q5299ydM5lrInLuKVmvPRosQkUucq6YzcjuTgVnM_x3LjQ">CERT-UA</a>, <a href="https://www.bitdefender.com/en-us/blog/businessinsights/uac-0063-cyber-espionage-operation-expanding-from-central-asia">BitDefender</a>, and <a href="https://blog.sekoia.io/double-tap-campaign-russia-nexus-apt-possibly-related-to-apt28-conducts-cyber-espionage-on-central-asia-and-kazakhstan-diplomatic-relations/">Sekoia</a>, with recent campaigns targeting entities in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and other Central Asian states. TAG-110 continues to use a variety of custom malware families to conduct espionage activities, including CHERRYSPY (DownExPyer), LOGPIE, and PyPlunderPlug.</p><h2 id="threat-analysis">Threat Analysis</h2><p>Beginning in January 2025, Insikt Group detected new TAG-110 first-stage payloads, which suggested the threat actors were evolving their tactics. Previously, TAG-110 leveraged macro-enabled Word documents to deliver HATVIBE, an HTA-based malware, for initial access. The newly detected documents do not contain the embedded HTA HATVIBE payload for creating a scheduled task and instead leverage a global template file placed in the Word startup folder for persistence.</p><h3 id="document-analysis">Document Analysis</h3><table>  <tr>    <td>SHA256 Hash</td>    <td>d60e54854f2b28c2ce197f8a3b37440dfa8dea18ce7939a356f5503ece9e5eb7</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>Document Name(s)</td>    <td>documents.php</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>Document Creation Time</td>    <td>2024-12-24 06:47:00 UTC</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>First Seen</td>    <td>2025-01-27 09:18:33 UTC</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>First Seen Triage</td>    <td>2024-01-31 18:16:00 UTC</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>C2 Host</td>    <td>http://38.180.206[.]61:80/engine.php</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td>File Type</td>    <td>MS Word 2007+ Macro-Enabled Template (.dotm)</td>  </tr></table><p><strong>Table 1:</strong> Metadata of <span style="font-family:courier;">d60e54854f2b28c2ce197f8a3b37440dfa8dea18ce7939a356f5503ece9e5eb7</span> (Source: Recorded Future)</p><p>The first document (<strong>Figure 1</strong>) appears to be a notice to the armed forces of Tajikistan themed on ensuring radiation safety.

For example, merchant data indicates that PETHOUSEN LLC is associated with pethousen[.]com rather than the three scam domains we linked it to (biliability[.]com, dknyonlineuk[.]com, outletmalleu[.]shop). Inaccurately associated merchant URLs often indicate that a merchant is engaging in transaction laundering.</p><br><hr><p><strong>Transaction laundering allows threat actors to conceal high-risk or illegal activity by processing payments for an entity, goods, or services unknown to the merchants acquiring bank or payment provider.</strong> While the transactions are disguised as low-risk or legitimate purchases, they are often transactions for illegal activities. In this sense, all purchase scam transactions that defraud victims are inherently a form of transaction laundering.</p><hr><br><p><strong>It is unclear whether the scam network identified in this report is controlled by a single threat actor or various threat actors acting in concert.</strong> Merchant account abuse for purchase scams frequently overlaps between networks of linked domains, as shown in Figure 2. While merchant accounts dispersed throughout scam networks network can have similarities that suggest a common origin or operator, the networks of scam domains linked to the merchant accounts are often distinct (for example, in their abuse of different ad platforms for propagation to victims)</p><p>Because of this, we consider the two following scenarios equally likely regarding attribution of the scam network to an operator:</p><ul><li>Multiple networks of scam domains operated by different threat actors may be using the same merchant accounts, whose services are rented out as part of a third-party, dark web-based cash-out offering.</li><li>A single threat actor may be controlling the domain and merchant infrastructure for the entire network, intentionally rotating the domain/merchant combinations in an attempt to obscure attribution.</li></ul><br><hr><p><strong>An ecosystem of illicit dark web services likely supports <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/how-cybercrime-gets-monetized">fraud-focused threat actors</a>.</strong> These threat actors leverage third-party services for a variety of scam use cases, including the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Fraud-based malvertising services:</strong> Threat actors organize illicit advertising services by compromising advertiser accounts for online ad platforms or by purchasing advertising campaigns using stolen financial data.</li><li><strong>Cash-out services:</strong> Threat actors purvey merchant accounts under their control to other threat actors to monetize stolen card data.</li><li><strong>Traffic services:</strong> Threat actors drive traffic to artificially boost malicious advertisements, including for scam websites, in search results. Alternatively, they partner with cash-out service providers to monetize existing victim traffic to scam domains.</li></ul><hr><br><p><strong>Card issuers and merchant acquirers with access to merchant data can likely leverage merchant analysis for threat actor attribution of this scam network.</strong> Commonalities in merchant registration would likely indicate that the accounts are operated by a single threat actor, whereas discrepancies would indicate that the accounts are operated by various threat actors. Identical company data is an example of a commonality that we would expect to see in linked merchant accounts operated by a single threat actor.</p><p>Note that since scam domains are easier to acquire and less resilient to detection and mitigation than merchant accounts (and therefore more expendable as infrastructure), we consider domain analysis less likely to enable threat actor attribution of this scam network.</p><h2 id="mitigations-for-fraud-prevention">Mitigations for Fraud Prevention</h2><p>Purchase scams present financial fraud risks to card issuers and compliance risks to merchant acquirers, especially in cases where linked scam merchant accounts are also abused to support transaction laundering activity. To reduce these risks, apply the mitigation strategies described below.</p><h3 id="card-issuers">Card Issuers</h3><ul><li>To prioritize fraud prevention over potential customer friction, immediately decline transactions with the identified scam merchant accounts and track customer card accounts that have transacted with the merchant for additional fraud signals before taking action.<ul><li>Escalate the fraud risk score of customer accounts that attempt transactions with the merchants or flag the account for additional review.</li><li>Consider the presence of additional fraud signals on flagged accounts as a high-confidence basis to reissue the customer card or apply other remediations.</li></ul></li><li>To minimize customer friction, assess transaction data within your cardholder portfolio with the identified scam merchant accounts before taking action against either the merchant accounts or customer card accounts.<ul><li>Bucket all customer transactions with the identified merchants.</li><li>Determine a fraud incidence threshold in accordance with your organizations risk tolerance. This threshold should be higher than the baseline fraud incidence rate observed across your portfolio.</li><li>If customer transactions within the bucket exceed the fraud incidence threshold, automatically block all customer transactions with the identified merchant accounts and consider card reissue.</li></ul></li><h3 id="merchant-acquirers">Merchant Acquirers</h3><ul><li>Analyze linked merchant domains to identify other likely fraudulent merchant accounts operated within the scam network. Card network acquirer data lookup APIs may enable merchant acquirers to search for merchant accounts based on domain.</li><li>Scan merchant acquirer BIN and MCC combinations within your merchant portfolio to identify other likely fraudulent merchant accounts registered with similar merchant data or within a short period of time. Card network APIs may enable merchant acquirers to search for merchant account registrations based on acquirer BIN and MCC. </li><li>Flag suspected fraudulent merchant accounts for enhanced due diligence, investigation, suspension, or termination in accordance with your risk tolerance.</li></ul><h2 id="outlook-for-purchase-scam-networks">Outlook for Purchase Scam Networks</h2><p>Our analysis has confirmed that the likely purchase scam network identified in this report has been operational since February 2025. Because we continue to confirm new scam domains within the group are operational, the scam operation appears to be ongoing. By extension, the scam operator will likely continue deploying new domains and online ad campaigns to support their scam activity, especially as old domains and ad campaigns are taken offline.</p><p>These new scam domains will likely use the merchant accounts identified in this report. Termination or suspension of scam merchant accounts by their acquirers is unlikely to halt all scam activity by the operator. However, this kind of remediation would almost certainly place additional time and resource demands on the scam network operator to acquire new merchant account infrastructure.</p><h2

            <description><![CDATA[Explore Insikt Group's in-depth 2025 report on the US-China AI race—comparing funding, talent, regulation, compute capacity, and model benchmarks. Discover why China trails the US and what could change before 2030.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2><p>China has stated its ambition to become the world leader in artificial intelligence (AI) by 2030, a goal that encompasses not only the performance of individual AI models that often attract significant media attention but also AI innovation broadly and widespread adoption of AI for economic and geopolitical benefit. Based on an analysis of key industry pillars informing the US-China competition for AI supremacy  including government and venture capital (VC) funding, industry regulation, talent, technology diffusion, model performance, and compute capacity  Insikt Group assesses that China is unlikely to sustainably surpass the United States (US) on its desired timeline. Currently, China either trails behind or does not clearly lead the US in any of these pillars. The US-China AI competition is likely to become tighter, with China&#39;s AI industry likely being a close second to the US globally and its AI models possibly outperforming the US at times or in some sectors. Chinese generative AI models likely lag behind US competitors by approximately three to six months as of this writing, based on Insikt Group analysis of publicly available Elo benchmarks, but potential new algorithmic breakthroughs along with agentic and collaborative AI systems could significantly sway the competitiveness of US or Chinese models before 2030.</p><p>Chinas government has sought to accelerate the development of a world-leading, globally influential AI industry since 2017, when authorities adopted a dedicated plan for achieving this goal. DeepSeeks unveiling of R1 in January 2025 was a key milestone in this endeavor. R1s capabilities reflect  and support continuing  noteworthy advances and lines of effort within Chinas AI ecosystem. Chinas AI research community is very likely benefiting from the governments supportive policy environment, government-led investment initiatives, access to an increasingly high-quality talent pool, and increasing links between academia and industry. Chinese AI companies like DeepSeek have realized performance gains by innovating and embracing open source. These companies have also become proficient at adopting techniques implemented by US peers and domestic rivals and prioritizing cost efficiency to remain competitive in domestic markets. Chinese open-source models are being adopted domestically and abroad, while inventors and organizations in China are filing more patents for generative AI applications in many key industries such as software, finance, and energy.</p><p>Despite this progress, Chinas AI industry faces important challenges. Total private sector investment in AI lags far behind the US, and central government funding likely trails US federal investment by a small margin. Chinas access to domestic AI-relevant talent is improving and the attractiveness of its domestic industry is increasing, but it is still insufficient, and the US likely retains its historical advantages. Chinas regulations, although pioneering, likely create a drag on innovation for teams with any interest in making their products public. Moreover, Chinas semiconductor industry  while achieving notable advances in spite of international export controls on specialized technology  is still unlikely to meet the rapidly growing demand for AI accelerator chips. </p><p>Maintaining leadership in the race to artificial general intelligence (AGI) is almost certainly perceived in China and the US as critical to their national security. To this end, China is almost certain to continue applying its kit of licit and illicit tools for advancing national development, to include economic espionage and foreign talent recruitment. The US and allied governments should closely monitor major developments by Chinese generative AI companies and public and private investment in research and development (R&amp;D), in addition to monitoring indicators of AI diffusion, such as applications and patents. Western AI companies should consider proactively protecting themselves from model distillation and intellectual property (IP) theft. Western hardware manufacturers subject to export controls should continue improving end-customer due diligence processes to remain compliant and avoid selling to proxies of entities sanctioned by the US. Western government, academic, and corporate entities should adopt policies that facilitate the recruitment and retention of global AI talent. </p><h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2><ul><li>Chinas rapidly maturing AI ecosystem is very likely increasingly fostering collaboration between government, industry, and academia, and is supported by steady advances in semiconductor manufacturing.</li><li>Government funding for AI-related technologies is likely on an upward trajectory in both the US and China as of early 2025, and Chinas overall government-led funding likely exceeds investment by US federal and state governments; however, total private-sector investment in AI companies in the US vastly outmatches private-sector investment in China.</li><li>Chinas regulatory scheme likely hampers Chinese AI capabilities and extends development and deployment timelines  but only among developers aiming for public-facing products, meaning frontier advancements are unlikely to be impeded.</li><li>The international AI talent pool likely continues to favor the US due to a continuing  though declining  immigration advantage and the quality of elite educational institutions, but the practical implications of this lead for AI competition are likely eroding.</li><li>AI diffusion rather than innovation will very likely determine the winner in the competition to economically and geopolitically benefit from the technology, but whether the US or China has greater levels of diffusion is unclear, with one metric (patents) nevertheless showing China has a lead in many industries.</li><li>According to Insikt Group&#39;s analysis of model benchmarks, Elo scores, and industry expert assessments, Chinese generative AI models likely now have a three to six-month performance gap behind US rivals, though this time lag is shortening.</li><li>Closing the performance gap while being cost-competitive is very likely to pay off for China by driving the adoption of Chinese generative AI models domestically and abroad. </li><li>Access to high-quality training data and IP is an increasingly contested domain where the US likely retains a competitive advantage; companies in both countries are likely leveraging user-generated content (UGC) to train generative AI models.</li><li>Adopting open source is more prevalent among Chinese AI companies and likely enables China to diffuse its models more broadly than US proprietary models.</li><li>US export controls have also almost certainly prompted the Chinese government to accelerate funding for its AI hardware and semiconductor industries and high-performance computing infrastructure for training and hosting AI models. </li><li>Chinas semiconductor industry likely still faces a bottleneck in producing sub-7 nanometer (nm) chips, and it is almost certainly attempting to develop its own extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography tools using alternative techniques to advance domestic AI accelerator production.</li><li>Although the current US presidential administration has signalled that maintaining the USs leading position in AI development is a priority, early actions to decrease public funding for science and target international students over alleged visa infractions likely risk undermining this goal.</li></ul><h2 id="background">Background</h2><p>The race to AGI, which is <a href=https://research.aimultiple.com/artificial-general-intelligence-singularity-timing/ target="_blank">estimated</a> by AI experts and industry leaders to be concluded within the next five to ten years, holds considerable stakes for <a href=https://yoshuabengio.org/2024/10/30/implications-of-artificial-general-intelligence-on-national-and-international-security/ target="_blank">national security</a> and <a href=https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/Philip-Trammell-and-Anton-Korinek_economic-growth-under-transformative-ai.pdf target="_blank">economic growth</a>.

Like missile production, the AGI race is not measured solely by <a href=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08956308.2024.2324407 target="_blank">innovation capacity</a> (launching Sputnik) but also <a href=https://www.fpri.org/article/2024/09/explaining-chinas-diffusion-deficit/ target="_blank">diffusion capacity</a>, or the ability of national ecosystems to align capital, talent, and policies to rapidly convert innovations to economically productive processes (winning the Cold War). The missile gap analogy is also accurate insofar as US leaders <a href=https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2011-05/missile-gap-myth-and-its-progeny target="_blank">long possessed</a> inaccurate data on Soviet missile capabilities; it was only by 1961 that innovations in satellite imagery <a href=https://www.thespacereview.com/article/523/1 target="_blank">allowed</a> decision-makers to obtain reliable data on this so-called missile gap. Following the launch of the CORONA satellite project to monitor Soviet ICBM capabilities and Chinese nuclear testing, US President Lyndon Johnson <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20220505011605/https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/12/science/spy-satellites-early-role-as-floodlight-coming-clear.html target="_blank">admitted</a> in 1967: We&#39;ve spent $35 billion or $40 billion on the space program. [...] We were doing things we didn&#39;t need to do. We were building things we didn&#39;t need to build. We were harboring fears we didn&#39;t need to harbor. Similarly, advances (whether real or speculative) in Chinese AI development are very likely fueling funding for AI research in the US, where AI capital expenditure is <a href=https://www.businessinsider.com/big-tech-ai-capex-spend-meta-google-amazon-microsoft-earnings-2025-2 target="_blank">projected to reach over $320 billion</a> in 2025, and influencing <a href=https://cdn.openai.com/global-affairs/ostp-rfi/ec680b75-d539-4653-b297-8bcf6e5f7686/openai-response-ostp-nsf-rfi-notice-request-for-information-on-the-development-of-an-artificial-intelligence-ai-action-plan.pdf target="_blank">opinions</a> on issues like AI regulation.</p><p>Maintaining an accurate threat perception of Chinese AI will almost certainly be key for major business and national security decision-makers in the US and its partners in the coming years. Despite the public perception of sudden and opaque progress via the lens of a Sputnik moment,&quot; the development of Chinas AI ecosystem almost certainly bears the fruit of long-term investments, iterative innovation, and the necessity for efficiency gains in the face of hardened chip export controls. </p><h2 id="chinas-ai-industry-and-landscape">Chinas AI Industry and Landscape</h2><p>In July 2017, Chinas State Council <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20250303185319/http://www.gov.cn/zhengce/content/2017-07/20/content_5211996.htm target="_blank">issued</a> the New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan (AIDP; ), which outlined an ambitious path to <a href=https://digichina.stanford.edu/work/full-translation-chinas-new-generation-artificial-intelligence-development-plan-2017/ target="_blank">achieving</a> world-leading AI theories, technologies, and applications and becoming the worlds primary AI innovation center by 2030. To achieve these goals, the AIDP calls (in part) for the activities listed below. The AIDP also outlined key challenges China faced at the time  and to some extent continues to face  including a lack of breakthroughs in basic AI theory, algorithms, high-end chips, and other resources and outputs. Since that time, Chinese universities and businesses have become increasingly involved in AI conferences at the frontiers of AI research and have released hundreds of generative AI models. At the same time, Chinas semiconductor industry is steadily advancing its capabilities in spite of international restrictions.</p><p>According to the AIDP, China would seek  and in many ways has begun, as documented in this report  to:</p><ul><li>Support a development framework that enables industry, academia, and other sectors to pursue joint and cross-disciplinary innovation</li><li>Seek breakthroughs in R&amp;D, applications, and overall industry, including along the AI-relevant industrial chain</li><li>Improve training and recruitment of talent, focusing on AI specifically as well as AIs application in other fields</li><li>Promote AI applications and AI-related innovations across industries, enterprises, and services</li><li>Coordinate support for AI across Chinas main science and technology (S&amp;T) pillars, including key programs, megaprojects, bases, and talent plans</li><li>Adopt a system of laws, regulations, and norms to aid the development of AI</li><li>Disseminate news of Chinas AI progress to foster a society enthusiastic about, and supportive of, AI development</li></ul><p>Chinas S&amp;T innovation <a href=https://scsp222.substack.com/p/the-missing-piece-in-chinas-innovation target="_blank">apparatus</a> very likely <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20240618141413/https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/NZxXb-LTiM3-PY4M36_VSA target="_blank">emphasizes</a> (though it is perceived to be deficient in) collaboration among government  including laboratories and state-owned enterprises [SOE])  industry, and academia. Accordingly, entities from each of these sectors contribute to Chinas AI development enterprise. Entities from all three sectors are increasingly producing noted contributions to AI R&amp;D and applications. Contributions to theoretical research can be observed in scholarly papers accepted to the prestigious AI-focused Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) since 2021. <strong>Table 1</strong> lists examples of government, industry, and academic entities from among the top fifteen institutions named as the affiliation of one or more co-authors on papers accepted by the conference (20212024).

Faced with explicit efforts by the US to curtail Chinas advances in both AI and semiconductors, Chinas support  including financial support  for the domestic semiconductor industry has almost certainly accelerated. One vehicle of state-led investment, the <a href=https://www.reuters.com/technology/china-sets-up-475-bln-state-fund-boost-semiconductor-industry-2024-05-27/ target="_blank">multi-phase</a> China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund (Big Fund; ) had minority <a href=https://thechinaproject.com/2023/02/03/chinas-top-10-semiconductor-firms/ target="_blank">ownership</a> in at least 74 domestic semiconductor companies as of February 2023.

It would be inaccurate to attribute all progress to this activity, but government-directed and tacitly allowed espionage almost certainly remains an important instrument in Chinas <a href=https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2025-02/Kyle_Chan_Testimony.pdf target="_blank">toolkit</a> for achieving modernization. In October 2023, intelligence leaders of the Five Eyes alliance <a href=https://www.reuters.com/world/five-eyes-intelligence-chiefs-warn-chinas-theft-intellectual-property-2023-10-18/ target="_blank">noted</a> AI as one sector targeted by Chinas illicit actions.

The engineer allegedly intended to use the information to support his own and another early-stage AI-related company. In November 2024, a former employee of South Koreas SK Hynix Inc. was <a href=https://www.asiafinancial.com/sk-hynix-worker-jailed-for-stealing-chip-tech-korea-bizwire target="_blank">convicted</a> of printing and seeking to retain proprietary documents on semiconductor manufacturing solutions in mid-2022, likely to <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20240528140713/https://m.koreatimes.co.kr/pages/article.amp.asp?newsIdx=375511 target="_blank">facilitate</a> her role in a new position at Huawei. Although not always a form of espionage, Chinas AI sector very likely further benefits from concerted efforts to <a href=https://www.trendforce.com/news/2025/02/21/new-ai-talent-race-heats-up-in-china-as-xiaomi-bytedance-and-alibaba-compete-for-experts/ target="_blank">attract</a> and <a href=https://chinatalenttracker.cset.tech/ target="_blank">recruit</a> <a href=https://www.reuters.com/technology/china-quietly-recruits-overseas-chip-talent-us-tightens-curbs-2023-08-24/ target="_blank">foreign</a> <a href=https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/gao-huajian-and-the-china-talent-returnee-question/ target="_blank">talent</a>. Additionally, there is <a href=https://www.theverge.com/news/601195/openai-evidence-deepseek-distillation-ai-data target="_blank">evidence</a> that Chinese companies have circumvented foreign platforms terms of service to enhance their own models through model distillation techniques.<h3 id="government-and-venture-capital-vc-funding">Government and Venture Capital (VC) Funding</h3><p>Funding for AI-related technologies is likely on an upward <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20250317132408/http://www.xinhuanet.com/fortune/20250313/a7cb29ba2b3a49f4a9ac9a7c57dac9eb/c.html target="_blank">trajectory</a> in both the US and China as of early 2025. Direct comparisons are difficult due to definitional issues and  especially with regard to China  data intransparency, but US federal government funding for civilian (non-military) AI likely exceeds the Chinese central governments funding by up to several billion USD per year, especially in light of evidence of declining expenditure by Beijing until approximately 2023 (likely in part due to COVID-19). The balance of government-led investment when including activity at the state and provincial levels likely leans in Chinas favor, where guidance funds combine public and private capital to invest approximately $16 billion annually in likely AI-related companies (broadly defined). Total private-sector investment in AI companies in the US far outstrips private-sector investment in China.</p><p>According to Federal Budget IQ, the US federal government has <a href=https://federalbudgetiq.com/insights/federal-ai-and-it-research-and-development-spending-analysis/ target="_blank">increased</a> its AI and IT R&amp;D spending from $8.2 billion in 2021 to $10.4 billion in 2024, a nearly 27% increase. The 2025 fiscal year budget earmarked $11.2 billion for AI and IT R&amp;D spending. Removing spending by the US Department of Defense (DoD; $2.035 billion) and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA; $1.41 billion), US federal spending on AI and IT R&amp;D for civilian applications represents approximately $7.33 billion. Within this, the budget for core AI ($1.955 billion) is the largest component, though funding for the likely AI-relevant area of high-capacity computing is also rising quickly. The US federal budget for core and cross-cut AI in fiscal year 2025 combined is $2.8 billion (excluding US DoD and DARPA).</p><p>In China, total central government funding for AI is much more opaque. <strong>Figure 2</strong> and <strong>Figure 3</strong> show likely AI-related investment in basic, applied, and experimental R&amp;D over recent years for two of Chinas <a href=https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2024-02/Ngor_Luong_Testimony.pdf target="_blank">largest</a> government-run institutions: the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). Specifically, <strong>Figure 3</strong> presents data from the budgets of three CAS institutes particularly <a href=https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/fueling-chinas-innovation-the-chinese-academy-of-sciences-and-its-role-in-the-prcs-st-ecosystem/ target="_blank">focused</a> on AI. <strong>Figure 4</strong> shows notionally earmarked funds for research to be conducted under Chinas New Generation Artificial Intelligence Megaproject ( 2030). In addition to these data points and trends, the two organizations <a href=https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/chinas-state-key-laboratory-system/ target="_blank">supervising</a> nearly half of Chinas state key labs (SKLs)  the Ministry of Education and CAS  cumulatively budgeted 2.4 billion RMB ($327 million) under associated R&amp;D line items. Of this, approximately 29% would go to SKLs in the information and communications technology field, assuming funds were distributed equally among all SKLs supervised by these organizations and not accounting for other known unknowns. </p><p>Insikt Groups review of the data summarized above and evidence from other central government funding channels leads us to a low-confidence estimate that Chinas central government spends on the order of several billion USD annually on likely AI-related R&amp;D, roughly similar to the US governments <a href="https://federalbudgetiq.com/insights/federal-ai-and-it-research-and-development-spending-analysis/#:~:text=For%20core%20AI%20funding%2C%20the,and%20Agriculture%20(%24104%20million)." target="_blank">spending</a> on core and cross-cut AI (excluding US DoD and DARPA). Because core and cross-cut AI have a clear definition and estimating Chinas funding relies on imperfect visibility into the research program it targets, it is likely that US federal government funding for AI is higher than that of Chinas central government. Total Chinese government-led investment in AI  via guidance funds  likely exceeds US cumulative federal and state investment, however (discussed further below). </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/us_china_ai_002_063c348af2.png" alt="us-china-ai-002.png"><em><strong>Figure 2:</strong> NSFC National Natural Sciences Fund Information Science Department (ISD) R&amp;D expenditures (actual) for AI and automation, 20182024 (RMB all years converted to 2025 dollars) (Source: Insikt Group)</em></p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/us_china_ai_003_ed88293530.png" alt="us-china-ai-003.png"><em><strong>Figure 3:</strong> R&amp;D expenditures (20182023 actual; 2024 budgeted) for AI-focused CAS research institutes, 20182024 (RMB all years converted to 2025 dollars) (Source: Insikt Group)</em></p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/us_china_ai_004_3d4b413b70.png" alt="us-china-ai-004.png"><em><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Annual proposed funding for projects announced under the New Generation Artificial Intelligence Megaproject, 2018 and 20202022 (data not available for 2019; RMB all years converted to 2025 dollars) (Source: Insikt Group)</em></p><p>The declining trend through the early 2020s is likely related to the impact of COVID-19 on Chinas economy, but should also be viewed cautiously given missing data from other central government funding channels. As of early 2025, central government actors have signaled increasing interest in AI. In January 2025, Bank of China <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20250127130750/https://www.bankofchina.com/aboutboc/bi1/202501/t20250123_25254674.html target="_blank">announced</a> a five-year plan for financially supporting the AI industry value chain with a minimum of one trillion RMB ($138 billion). In March 2025, Chinas National Development and Reform Commission <a href=https://archive.ph/7rzg6 target="_blank">announced</a> the establishment of a National Innovation Investment Guidance Fund (). The new fund is being dubbed an aircraft carrier-level () fund and will seek to raise one trillion RMB ($138.2 billion) while focusing investment on start-up, early-stage, small-, and medium-sized enterprises in frontier domains like AI, quantum science, and future energy. Indicating its focus on the concept of patient capital,&quot; the funds duration is being set at twenty years  reportedly about five years longer than most other guidance funds.</p><p>Government guidance funds, such as the one announced in March 2025, have been established at multiple levels of government in China and <a href=https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/understanding-chinese-government-guidance-funds/ target="_blank">mix</a> funds from governmental and non-governmental sources (including corporate sources). This creates a challenge when attempting to isolate just central government funding. However, research published by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) has <a href=https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w32701/w32701.pdf target="_blank">found</a> that more broadly across central, provincial, and local governments, these guidance funds have invested in 9,623 unique AI firms through more than 20,000 transactions, in total 184 billion USD between 2000 and 2023, with the majority of transactions occurring since 2013. Annualizing this estimate over the 20132023 period points to an average spend of $16.7 billion per year, though the NBER studys method of identifying AI companies was very broad and potentially leads to an overestimate. There are state-level initiatives in the US, such as New Yorks Empire AI consortium that has received $565 million in <a href=https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-unveils-fifth-proposal-2024-state-state-empire-ai-consortium-make-new-york target="_blank">funding</a> from public and private <a href=https://govmarketnews.com/new-york-boosts-ai-research-with-165m-funding-package/ target="_blank">sources</a>, but they likely do not match sub-national funding in China, which is steadily increasing. In January 2025, two state-backed Chinese investment <a href=https://archive.ph/cjS4z target="_blank">companies</a> <a href=https://archive.ph/RZBdk target="_blank">announced</a> the creation of a National Artificial Intelligence Industry Investment Fund () with an initial registered capital of 60 billion RMB ($8.2 billion).</p><p>Although Chinas government may be ahead in terms of total AI investment  when the likely small lag in central government spending is compared to the likely larger lead in sub-national investment through guidance funds  total private-sector investment in AI companies in the US vastly outmatches private-sector investment in China. This is seen in data (<strong>Figure 5</strong>) collected by both Stanford Universitys Center for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (Stanford HAI) and the Emerging Technology Observatory (ETO), a project under Georgetown Universitys Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET). Note that there is likely overlap between the aforementioned investments of Chinas guidance funds and the private-sector investment data; that is, this data likely does not exclude investments in AI companies that come from government sources. This private-sector investment data is narrower, however; ETOs data only reflects investments into 2,100 Chinese AI companies compared to the NBER studys over 9,000 companies.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/us_china_ai_005_02e8fac98a.png" alt="us-china-ai-005.png"><em><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Disclosed private-sector investment in China and the US, 20132023 (Sources: <a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2024-ai-index-report" target="_blank">Stanford HAI</a>; <a href="https://cat.eto.tech/?countries=China+%28mainland%29%2CUnited+States&countryGroups=&dataset=Investment&expanded=Summary-metrics%2CChanges-over-time" target="_blank">ETO</a>)</em></p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/ta-2025-0508.pdf" target="_blank">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[There was much to see at RSAC 2025. Read the recap about a few highlights from the expo floor.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 2025 RSA Conference in San Francisco once again showcased the cutting edge of cybersecurity innovation. This year&#39;s expo floor was particularly vibrant, reflecting how the industry continues to evolve in response to increasingly sophisticated threats. As I navigated the bustling halls, I noted key highlights and trends that are notable for the conference and shaping the security market.</p><h3 id="ai-assisted-security-operations">AI Assisted Security Operations</h3><p>The most prominent theme throughout the expo was the integration of advanced AI into security tools. This year&#39;s offerings demonstrated AI assisted capabilities that provide actionable intelligence and simplify complex tasks.Several vendors showcased platforms that went beyond just incorporating AI but now take actions to offload some of the work of security practitioners. When businesses need to do more with less along with the struggle to find security talent, this should go a long way.</p><h3 id="the-spectrum-of-threat-intelligence">The Spectrum of Threat Intelligence</h3><p>One thing that caught my eye when walking the expo floor was the number of vendors and booths displaying Threat Intelligence signage prominently on their displays and TVs. After talking to reps at the booths, it was clear that there is a wide spectrum of threat intelligence available, and it is important to know which type works best for you and asking what sort of threat intelligence the vendor is offering. One one end of the spectrum, you have some vendors are providing true first-party threat (first-party threat intelligencedata collected directly by the vendor through their own sensors, honeypots, and research teamsproviding unique visibility that can&#39;t be found elsewhere) intelligence, while the other end of the spectrum are vendors providing threat intelligence in their products that consists of the ability to take in an open source feed.</p><h3 id="animals-of-cybersecurity-marketing">Animals of Cybersecurity Marketing</h3><p>A big highlight of the expo were two vendors taking a decidedly analog approach to standing out on the crowded RSAC expo floor. Attendees could take a break from technical discussions to spend a few minutes cuddling the puppies who were available for adoption. Just across the room, a small pen of miniature goats complete with hay bales and &quot;Greatest Of All Time (GOAT)&quot; signage, created an effective contrast to the high-tech solutions being pitched. Both animal-themed booths proved that in the battle for attendee attention, sometimes the most effective strategy is simply offering a moment of joy amid the cybersecurity intensity.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/rsac_recap_001_7e1f1ab0cb.jpg" alt="rsac-recap-001.jpg"></p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/rsac_recap_002_b45674d1da.jpg" alt="rsac-recap-002.jpg"></p><h2 id="recorded-futures-branding-and-malware-intelligence-on-the-expo-floor">Recorded Futures Branding and Malware Intelligence on the Expo Floor</h2><p>A highlight for me was seeing Recorded Futures new brand on display front and center on the show floor with the new electric blue and bold red accent colors. The boldness of the brand stood out amid a sea of sameness  dark displays, matrix-like code animations, and ubiquitous hooded figures  and captured what Recorded Future is all about. When organizations are facing increasingly sophisticated threats, they need a bold partner that stands out from the others with clarity, focus, and actionable insights.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/rsac_recap_003_0006170bd7.jpg" alt="rsac-recap-003.jpg"></p><p>Coupling the new brand with the launch of Recorded Futures new Malware Intelligence offerings made the booth one of the must see stops as attendees made their way around the floor. Attendees were able to see demos of the product and see for themselves how Malware Intelligence helped achieve the following outcomes:</p><ul><li>Reduction in time spent analyzing malware samples</li><li>Automated malware detection at scale</li><li>Shift from reactive to proactive and spot emerging threats before they become a problem</li></ul><p><strong>The average team saves 11 hours weekly on threat analysis, hunting, and reporting efforts with Recorded Future Malware Intelligence (<a href="http://uevi.co/6959AEDT">Source</a>)</strong></p><p>The team also discussed the new capabilities available with Malware Intelligence including malware hunting, Auto YARA Rules, and malware Alerts. </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/rsa_recap_004_dc75835b70.png" alt="rsa-recap-004.png"></p><p>Dont worry if you were unable to stop by the booth, you can find more information on Malware Intelligence on the new Recorded Future website at <a href="http://www.recordedfuture.com/malware-intelligence">www.recordedfuture.com/malware-intelligence</a>.</p><h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2><p>As I left the expo floor, it was clear that the cybersecurity industry continues its march toward more integrated, intelligence-driven approaches. The vendors that stood out weren&#39;t those with the flashiest booths or the most aggressive marketingthey were those offering genuine advancements in connecting disparate security data points into coherent, actionable intelligence. As the conference comes to a close, it was great to hear all the new ideas, see the keynotes, and network with other security practitioners. I look forward to RSAC 2026 and I am curious what animals might be on the show floor next year.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Insikt Group reveals two emerging malware strains—TerraStealerV2 and TerraLogger—linked to Golden Chickens, a threat actor behind credential theft and keylogging MaaS platforms. Learn how these tools operate and evolve.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt group logo"></p><h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2><p>Insikt Group identified two new malware families  TerraStealerV2 and TerraLogger  linked to the financially motivated threat actor Golden Chickens (also known as Venom Spider). Golden Chickens is known for operating a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) platform used by cybercriminal groups such as FIN 6, Cobalt Group, and Evilnum. The new families, observed between January and April 2025, suggest ongoing development aimed at credential theft and keylogging.</p><p>TerraStealerV2 is designed to collect browser credentials, cryptocurrency wallet data, and browser extension information. While it targets the Chrome Login Data database to steal credentials, it does not bypass Application Bound Encryption (ABE) protections introduced in Chrome updates after July 2024, indicating the malware code is outdated or still under development. Data is exfiltrated to both Telegram and the domain wetransfers[.]io. The stealer has been observed being distributed via multiple formats, including LNK, MSI, DLL, and EXE files, and leverages trusted Windows utilities, such as regsvr32.exe and mshta.exe, to evade detection.</p><p>TerraLogger, by contrast, is a standalone keylogger. It uses a common low-level keyboard hook to record keystrokes and writes the logs to local files. However, it does not include functionality for data exfiltration or command-and-control (C2) communication, indicating it is either in early development or intended to be a modular part of the Golden Chickens MaaS ecosystem.</p><p>The current state of TerraStealerV2 and TerraLogger suggests that both tools remain under active development and do not yet exhibit the level of stealth typically associated with mature Golden Chickens tooling. Given Golden Chickens history of developing malware for credential theft and access operations, these capabilities will likely continue to evolve. Organizations are advised to follow the mitigation guidance provided in this report to reduce the risk of compromise as these malware families mature.</p><h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2><ul><li>Insikt Group identified two new malware families, TerraStealerV2 and TerraLogger, attributed to the threat actor Golden Chickens. TerraStealerV2 can steal browser credentials and target cryptocurrency wallets, while TerraLogger functions solely as a standalone keylogger module.</li><li>TerraLogger is the first observed use of a keylogging capability within malware developed by Golden Chickens.</li><li>TerraStealerV2 lacks support for decrypting Chrome ABE-protected credentials, indicating the tool is likely outdated or still under development.</li><li>Insikt Group observed ten distinct TerraStealerV2 distribution samples between January and March 2025 that employed varied delivery methods, including MSI, DLL, and LNK files.</li></ul><h2 id="background">Background</h2><p>Golden Chickens, also tracked under the alias Venom Spider, is a financially motivated cyber threat actor known for operating a stealthy and modular malware suite under a MaaS model. Since <a href="https://www.esentire.com/resources/library/unmasking-venom-spider" target="_blank">at least</a> 2018, the Golden Chickens MaaS suite has been deployed in campaigns targeting high-value organizations through social engineering vectors, particularly spearphishing campaigns leveraging fake job offers or resumes. Notably, the malware is used by top-tier cybercrime groups, including Russia-based FIN6 and Cobalt Group, as well as the Belarus-based Evilnum, which has been <a href="https://www.esentire.com/resources/library/unmasking-venom-spider" target="_blank">linked</a> to damages of over $1.5 billion USD globally.</p><p>The core components of the Golden Chickens MaaS suite are VenomLNK and TerraLoader. Initial infections are typically achieved through VenomLNK, a malicious Windows shortcut file, which executes TerraLoader, a loader module responsible for deploying additional Golden Chickens malware. These modules include TerraStealer for credential harvesting, TerraTV for TeamViewer hijacking, and TerraCrypt for ransomware deployment. Additional malware families attributed to the Golden Chickens ecosystem include TerraRecon for reconnaissance, TerraWiper for data wiping, and lite_more_eggs, as depicted in Figure 1 below.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/Terra_Stealer_V2_001_a85a7e73ff.png" alt="TerraStealerV2-001.png"><em><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Previously reported Golden Chickens malware families (Source: <a href="https://quointelligence.eu/2020/01/the-chicken-keeps-laying-new-eggs-uncovering-new-gc-maas-tools-used-by-top-tier-threat-actors/" target="_blank">Quo Intelligence</a>)</em></p><p>Attribution efforts by eSentires Threat Response Unit have <a href="https://www.esentire.com/resources/library/unmasking-venom-spider" target="_blank">linked</a> Golden Chickens to a threat actor known as badbullzvenom, a persona that is believed to be operated jointly by individuals from Moldova and Montreal, Canada. The threat actors development history demonstrates progress from a low-level forum participant to an established MaaS provider. Tools developed by Golden Chickens have been <a href="https://www.esentire.com/resources/library/unmasking-venom-spider" target="_blank">weaponized</a> in several campaigns, including high-profile attacks on British Airways, Newegg, and Ticketmaster UK.</p><p>Between August and October 2024, Zscaler ThreatLabz <a href="https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/unveiling-revc2-and-venom-loader" target="_blank">observed</a> renewed activity attributed to Golden Chickens involving the deployment of two newly identified malware families: RevC2 and Venom Loader. These tools were delivered via VenomLNK campaigns, leveraging social engineering lures like cryptocurrency payment requests and software API documentation. <strong>Figure 2</strong> illustrates the attack chain used to deliver RevC2.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/Terra_Stealer_V2_002_d21c2d4a2a.png" alt="TerraStealerV2-002.png"><em><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Recent Golden Chickens attack chain used to deliver RevC2 (Source: <a href="https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/unveiling-revc2-and-venom-loader" target="_blank">ZScaler</a>)</em></p><p>While the initial delivery vector is not known, the infection sequence begins with the execution of a VenomLNK file. This file downloads a decoy image consistent with the lure theme (in this case, software API documentation) and initiates RevC2 execution. Specifically, the LNK file leverages <span style="font-family:courier;">wmic.exe</span> to invoke <span style="font-family:courier;">regsvr32.exe</span>, which loads a malicious OCX payload hosted on a remote network share.</p><h2 id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis</h2><p>Insikt Group identified two new malware families attributed to the threat actor group Golden Chickens. The first, tracked as TerraStealerV2, is a stealer primarily targeting browser credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, and browser extensions. The second, tracked as TerraLogger, is a keylogger observed as a standalone module. The following subsections provide a detailed technical analysis of each malware family.</p><h3 id="terrastealerv2">TerraStealerV2</h3><p>Insikt Group recently identified a new stealer attributed to Golden Chickens, uploaded to Recorded Future Malware Intelligence on March 3, 2025. A Program Database (PDB) path embedded in the sample (see <strong>Figure 3</strong>) suggests the threat actor refers to the malware as NOK; however, Insikt Group tracks it as TerraStealerV2.</p><table><tbody><tr><td style="font-family:Courier New;background-color:#ffffff;">C:\Users\Admin\source\repos\NOK\NOK\x64\Release\NOK.pdb</td></tr></tbody></table><em><strong>Figure 3:</strong> TerraStealerV2 PDB string (Source: Recorded Future)</em><br><p>The stealer is intended to be delivered as an OCX file and executed via <span style="font-family:courier;">regsvr32.exe</span>, which invokes the <span style="font-family:courier;">DllRegisterServer</span> export function. Upon execution, <span style="font-family:courier;">DllRegisterServer</span> first checks that the provided file has a .ocx extension and that the filename ends with a specific hard-coded character or digit (for example, 0.ocx). It then verifies that the file is being run by <span style="font-family:courier;">regsvr32.exe</span> before proceeding, as illustrated in <strong>Figure 4</strong> below.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/Terra_Stealer_V2_003_e0b3640e79.png" alt="TerraStealerV2-003.png"><em><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Flow chart illustrating TerraStealerV2s anti-analysis checks (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><p>The malware then performs string deobfuscation using an XOR decoding routine with a hard-coded key.

This behavior is likely intended to release any file locks on Chromes browser database files, ensuring unobstructed access during data extraction. Following this, the malware attempts to extract stored credentials and other sensitive data from Chrome and targets specific cryptocurrency wallets and browser extensions.</p><p>The Chrome browser database theft implementation copies the &quot;Login Data&quot; database to <span style="font-family:courier;">C:ProgramData\Temp\LoginData</span> and then extracts saved logins using a statically linked SQLite library to execute the SQL query <span style="font-family:courier;">SELECT origin_url</span>, <span style="font-family:courier;">username_value</span>, <span style="font-family:courier;">password_value FROM logins</span>. TerraStealerV2 uses SQLite version 3.46.0, which is the same version statically linked in RevC2, suggesting possible code reuse or shared development practices. However, the implementation does not bypass Chromes ABE, meaning collected passwords will not be decrypted for any hosts with Chrome-based browsers updated since July 24, 2024. This limitation suggests that the stealer code is outdated or still under active development, as effective stealers typically incorporate ABE bypass techniques to extract decrypted credentials from modern versions of Chrome or Microsoft Edge.</p><p>Exfiltrated browser login data and informational messages are written to <span style="font-family:courier;">C:\ProgramData\file.txt</span> and copied to <span style="font-family:courier;">%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Bay0NsQIzx\p.txt</span> when stealing operations have completed. If found, targeted browser extensions and wallets have their directories copied to <span style="font-family:courier;">%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Bay0NsQIzx</span>, and a Telegram message is sent indicating the number of crypto wallets found.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt group logo"></p><h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2><p>MintsLoader, a malicious loader, was first observed in multiple phishing and drive-by download campaigns as early as 2024. The loader commonly deploys second-stage payloads such as GhostWeaver, StealC, and a modified BOINC (Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing) client. MintsLoader operates through a multi-stage infection chain involving obfuscated JavaScript and PowerShell scripts. The malware employs sandbox and virtual machine evasion techniques, a domain generation algorithm (DGA), and HTTP-based command-and-control (C2) communications.</p><p>MintsLoader has been observed being used by various threat groups; however, operators of TAG-124 (also known as LandUpdate808) have used it extensively. The loader is deployed through multiple infection vectors, including phishing emails targeting the industrial, legal, and energy sectors (TAG-124); compromised websites impersonating browser update prompts (SocGholish); and invoice-themed lures distributed via Italys PEC certified email system.</p><p>MintsLoaders use of obfuscation complicates static detections such as YARA rules, its use of DGA-based C2 infrastructure makes it difficult to maintain up-to-date watchlists or blocklists, and its anti-analysis techniques complicate host-based detections that rely on sandboxes or virtualization. But Recorded Futures Malware Intelligence Hunting identifies new MintsLoader samples and associated C2 domains and provides an up-to-date list for blocklists or threat hunting.</p><p>MintsLoaders persistent use of obfuscation, sandbox evasion, and adaptive infrastructure likely ensures its continued presence within the malware ecosystem, likely leading to increased use by additional threat actors. The malwares role as a versatile delivery mechanism reflects the increasing professionalization and specialization within the cybercriminal community. While this growing sophistication benefits threat actors by enabling more resilient and efficient operations, it may simultaneously provide opportunities for defenders to identify and disrupt malicious activity more effectively and at scale.</p><h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2><ul><li>MintsLoader&#39;s second-stage PowerShell script uses sandbox and virtual environment evasion techniques, reducing its susceptibility to automated analysis and increasing its likelihood of bypassing dynamic detection tools.</li><li>MintsLoader&#39;s use of a DGA to generate daily C2 domains based on the system date complicates infrastructure monitoring activity and domain/IP-based detections. </li><li>Recorded Futures Malware Intelligence Hunting provides up-to-date C2 domains and other artifacts related to MintsLoader that would otherwise be hard to track due to its dynamic infrastructure.</li><li>Insikt Group shows that GhostWeaver is the primary payload deployed by MintsLoader across observed campaigns.</li><li>GhostWeavers self-signed X.509 certificates are similar to those of AsyncRAT and variants of AsyncRAT, leading to initial false associations with other malware families such as AsyncRAT.</li></ul><h2 id="background">Background</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/cert-orangecyberdefense/mintsloader" target="_blank">Orange Cyberdefense</a> first detected MintsLoader in widespread distribution campaigns between July and October 2024. Insikt Group identified earlier campaigns in February 2024, based on Palo Altos Unit42 <a href="https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/Unit42-timely-threat-intel/blob/main/2024-02-21-IOCs-from-SocGholish-AsyncRAT-infection.txt" target="_blank">analysis</a> of a SocGholish infection. </p><p>The loader consists of JavaScript (stage one) and PowerShell (stage two) scripts retrieved from multiple DGA-based domains. The name MintsLoader is derived from its distinctive use of the URL parameter <span style="font-family:courier;">s=mints[NUMBER]</span> (for example, <span style="font-family:courier;">s=mints11</span>). MintsLoader is typically <a href="https://trac-labs.com/dont-ghost-the-socgholish-ghostweaver-backdoor-574154dd9983" target="_blank">observed</a> in campaigns delivering secondary payloads such as GhostWeaver, StealC, and the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) client. </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/malware_hunting_001_49740c53e8.png" alt="malware-hunting-001.png"><em><strong>Figure 1:</strong> MintsLoader profile (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><p>While MintsLoader is believed to be used by multiple threat actors, TAG-124 (also known as LandUpdate808) infections have frequently been observed deploying MintsLoader. Additionally, threat actors using SocGholish were early adopters of MintsLoader, resulting in the initial assessment of MintsLoader campaigns as being exclusively associated with SocGholish. For example, in February 2024, Palo Altos Unit42 <a href="https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/Unit42-timely-threat-intel/blob/main/2024-02-21-IOCs-from-SocGholish-AsyncRAT-infection.txt" target="_blank">released</a> indicators linked to SocGholish (Figure 2); however, Insikt Group&#39;s analysis indicates that the URLs identified as delivering AsyncRAT also align with known MintsLoader URL patterns. </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/malware_hunting_002_3aaff8bc04.png" alt="malware-hunting-002.png"><em><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Palo Alto SocGholish infection IoCs (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><p>Similarly, in July 2024, Huntress Labs <a href="https://www.huntress.com/blog/fake-browser-updates-lead-to-boinc-volunteer-computing-software" target="_blank">reported</a> a SocGholish infection delivering a BOINC client.

Although MintsLoader functions solely as a loader without supplementary capabilities, its primary strengths lie in its sandbox and virtual machine evasion techniques and a DGA implementation that derives the C2 domain based on the day it is run. These features significantly complicate static analysis and host-based detection. Despite this, its C2 communications occur over HTTP, which provides a reliable vector for detecting and identifying new samples. <strong>Figure 8</strong> provides the high-level capabilities of MintsLoader.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/malware_hunting_008_18871d3457.png" alt="malware-hunting-008.png"><em><strong>Figure 8:</strong> MintsLoader high-level capabilities (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><p>This analysis of MintsLoader includes details on the first- and second-stage payloads and MintsLoader infrastructure.</p><h2 id="mintsloader-attack-chain">MintsLoader Attack Chain</h2><p>MintsLoader is commonly delivered via phishing emails containing links to KongTuke or ClickFix pages. When executed, these pages retrieve and run the first stage of JavaScript. The JavaScript is heavily obfuscated, and execution leads to running a PowerShell command to download and execute the second stage of MintsLoader, as shown in <strong>Figure 9</strong>.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/malware_hunting_009_a7599f2c0f.png" alt="malware-hunting-009.png"><em><strong>Figure 9:</strong> First stage of MintsLoader infection (Source: <a href="https://tria.ge/250303-rmy8lsznz9/behavioral2" target="_blank">Recorded Future Malware Intelligence</a>)</em></p><p>This second stage conducts environment checks to determine whether it is running in a sandbox or virtualized setting. Next, the script uses a DGA to produce the next C2 domain. MintsLoader then attempts to contact the generated domain to download the final payload, such as GhostWeaver, StealC, or the BOINC client. Figure 10 shows a high-level overview of this attack chain.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/malware_hunting_010_f7eb608c62.png" alt="malware-hunting-010.png"><em><strong>Figure 10:</strong> Common MintsLoader infection chain (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><h2 id="stage-one-javascript">Stage One: JavaScript</h2><p>The initial stage of MintsLoader consists of a JavaScript file that executes a PowerShell command to retrieve the second stage.

            <description><![CDATA[Recorded Future’s Malware Intelligence rethinks traditional malware analysis to empower organizations to act first against modern threats.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my conversations with security leaders across industries, I hear a consistent theme: traditional approaches to malware detection and analysis are failing to keep pace with the evolving threat landscape. This challenge has become even more pronounced as adversaries increasingly leverage AI to accelerate and enhance their attacks.</p><p>The statistics tell a sobering story. The average dwell time for threats in 2024 remains at approximately 10 days. Nearly half of CISOs report missing data breaches with their existing security tools. And 93% of malware hides in data-in-transit<sup>1</sup>. These aren&#39;t just numbersthey represent real business risk that security teams struggle to address with limited resources and reactive approaches.</p><p>Today, I&#39;m excited to announce a solution that fundamentally transforms how organizations defend against malware: <strong>Recorded Future&#39;s Malware Intelligence</strong>. </p><h2 id="beyond-isolated-analysis">Beyond Isolated Analysis</h2><p>Traditional malware analysis happens in isolationdisconnected from the broader threat landscape. Security teams spend countless hours manually investigating samples without the contextual intelligence needed to understand their true risk or deploy effective protections quickly.</p><p>Malware Intelligence fundamentally changes this approach by connecting every malware sample to our Intelligence Graph&#39;s 15+ years of threat and malware data. This allows security teams to not just analyze what the malware does, but understand its lineage, predict its evolution, and automatically generate protectionsgiving you complete context and automated defenses in seconds rather than days.</p><h2 id="the-power-of-the-intelligence-graph">The Power of the Intelligence Graph</h2><p>What makes this approach possible is the Recorded Future Intelligence Graphthe world&#39;s only threat intelligence repository with over 200 billion nodes of interconnected data built over 15 years. By leveraging this unmatched intelligence foundation, we&#39;ve created capabilities that transform malware defense from a reactive exercise to a proactive strategy:</p><ol><li><strong>Intelligence Graph correlation</strong> with 1.5M+ new malware samples/day providing immediate context about origins, attribution, and potential impact</li><li><strong>Auto YARA rule generation</strong> powered by pattern recognition creates instant protection against identified threats and their variants</li><li><strong>Dynamic alerting</strong> identifies emerging threats through static and behavioral analysis before they target your organization</li><li><strong>Seamless integration</strong> with existing security controls enables immediate protection without workflow disruption</li><li><strong>Advanced Sandbox</strong> empowers security teams to upload and and detonate potential malware in an interactive environment, unlocking deep insights into threat behavior and attack strategies - <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/get-started#free-tools">try it free today</a> and see the difference.</li></ol><h2 id="transforming-cyber-operations">Transforming Cyber Operations</h2><p>For security teams, the impact is transformative. One customer described our approach as making their team &quot;look prophetic&quot;they could get out in front of threats before they materialized rather than constantly reacting to incidents.</p><p>Early adopters are reporting remarkable results including 3x reduction in triage time and ability to run threat hunts automatically.</p><p>These aren&#39;t just efficiency metricsthey represent a fundamental shift in how security teams operate and the level of protection they can provide to their organizations.</p><h2 id="from-manual-to-automated-from-reactive-to-proactive">From Manual to Automated, From Reactive to Proactive</h2><p>What excites me most about Malware Intelligence is how it addresses the critical challenges facing security teams today:</p><ul><li><strong>For resource-constrained teams</strong>, it provides automation that eliminates hours of manual rule-writing and scales threat hunting capabilities without adding headcount</li><li><strong>For organizations struggling with alert fatigue</strong>, it delivers high-confidence intelligence that focuses teams on what matters most</li><li><strong>For security leaders concerned about emerging threats</strong>, it provides predictive capabilities that identify variants before they impact your systems</li></ul><p>Most importantly, it enables security teams to shift from a reactive posturewhere they&#39;re constantly on the back foot against attackersto a proactive strategy where they can anticipate and prevent attacks before they occur.</p><h2 id="the-future-of-intelligence-driven-security">The Future of Intelligence-Driven Security</h2><p>Malware Intelligence represents a significant step in our vision to enable you to know what matters and act first. By connecting the dots between isolated malware samples and the broader threat landscape, we&#39;re enabling security teams to defend at the speed and scale that modern threats demand.</p><p>As attack techniques continue to evolve with the aid of AI, the advantage will belong to those with superior intelligence capabilities. That&#39;s precisely what we&#39;re delivering with Malware Intelligencea capability that transforms how organizations detect, understand, and respond to malware threats that matter most to their business.</p><p>This is available today for all our customers who own our Threat Intelligence Module.

            <description><![CDATA[Drowning in security data but missing real threats? Learn how threat actors exploit this paradox—and how to turn your data into actionable intelligence.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Security teams are drowning in data, yet many struggle to extract actionable insights. As threats grow more complex, the <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/enhanced-visibility-and-hardening-guidance-communications-infrastructure" target="_blank">demand</a> for visibility has never been greater. But more data does not always mean better security outcomes. 63% of daily alerts are low priority or false positives, causing SOC analysts to <a href="https://panther.com/blog/identifying-and-mitigating-false-positive-alerts#:~:text=found%20that%20an%20estimated%20one%2Dthird%20of%20their%20workday%20is%20spent%20on%20incidents%20that%20are%20not%20real%20threats%2C%20with%20FP%20and%20low%2Dpriority%20alerts%20comprising%20roughly%2063%25%20of%20daily%20alerts." target="_blank">report</a> spending nearly a third of their time on incidents that pose no real threat. At the same time, 58% of analysts <a href="https://finitestate.io/blog/industry-report-false-positives-software-security#:~:text=58%25%20said%20false%20positives%20take%20more%20time%20to%20resolve%20than%20true%20positives" target="_blank">report</a> that false positives take more time to resolve than actual threats. Without the right tools and methods to interpret this information, more data just means more noise. This results in a visibility paradox: the more security data that is collected, the harder it becomes to spot real threats.</p><h2 id="how-threat-actors-exploit-the-visibility-paradox">How Threat Actors Exploit the Visibility Paradox</h2><p>Threat actors are capitalizing on this paradox. Recorded Futures analysis of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) shows that threat actors are exploiting everyday traffic patterns and system behaviors to operate undetected, effectively hiding in plain sight.</p><ul><li><strong>250% Spike in Camouflaged Communication:</strong> The use of the application layer protocol (T1071) for command-and-control operations, disguised as routine network traffic, increased by over 250% between 2023 and 2024. Nearly half of all data exfiltration incidents tracked by Recorded Future in 2024 involved this technique.</li><li><strong>Use of Malicious Infrastructure to Blend in with Web Traffic:</strong> Multiple threat actors are taking <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/tag-124-multi-layered-tds-infrastructure-extensive-user-base" target="_blank">advantage</a> of specialized malicious traffic-distribution systems that rapidly rotate URLs to evade static blocking mechanisms. This allows malicious infrastructure to mimic legitimate web activity and bypass conventional defenses.</li><li><strong>33% Increase in System Information Discovery:</strong> Between 2023 and 2024, there was an uptick in the use of discovery tactics that allow threat actors to map and understand the target environment. System information discovery enables defense evasion techniques that commonly appear in ransomware, like disabling or modifying tools or modifying registry.</li></ul><p>Threat actors often rotate through indicators such as IP addresses, file hashes, and domains, reducing the effectiveness of static detections. Without careful tuning, alerts triggered by suspicious discovery or C2 behavior can generate high levels of false positives on legitimate processes or normal network traffic.</p><h2 id="automation-and-specialization-create-even-more-noise">Automation and Specialization Create Even More Noise</h2><p>Two trends are likely to fuel an increase in this activity. First, threat actors are specializing more than ever, allowing for sophisticated exploits across specific areas of the cyber kill chain. The <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/initial-access-brokers-key-to-rise-in-ransomware-attacks" target="_blank">rise</a> of initial access brokers and recent <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/vextrio-tds-biggest-cybercrime-operation-web" target="_blank">discoveries</a> of specialized access and C2 infrastructure highlight this shift. Second, threat actors are increasingly using AI tools. While malware isnt autonomous yet, threat actors are exploiting LLMs and machine learning to automate and randomize delivery infrastructure, such as by <a href="https://blogs.infoblox.com/threat-intelligence/rdgas-the-next-chapter-in-domain-generation-algorithms/" target="_blank">registering</a> thousands of unique domain names daily for malicious use. The volume and randomness make these domains extremely difficult to detect or block.</p><h2 id="beat-the-paradox-by-making-the-most-of-data">Beat the Paradox by Making the Most of Data</h2><p>Behavior-based detection, rather than static indicators, is pivotal to catching these threats. However, collecting enough data to understand behavior can exacerbate the visibility paradox if defenders dont have a strategy for making sense of their alerts. This is where better analytics and intelligence-driven hunting can help:</p><ul><li><strong>Understand what is normal in your systems:</strong> Detecting subtle anomalies requires a deep understanding of baseline network behavior, also known as <a href="https://www.blackfog.com/cybersecurity-101/baselining" target="_blank">baselining</a>. Without this, deviations can go unnoticed.</li><li><strong>Integrate your tools:</strong> Avoid alerting silos. Centralizing and enriching data in a unified platform, such as - Recorded Futures Collective Insights tool, helps surface more meaningful signals.</li><li><strong>Test alerts with intelligence-driven hunts:</strong> Purple teaming, a method of vulnerability assessment that combines data from red- and blue-team exercises to improve network defense, helps to verify detection capabilities. Red teams can use real-world threat intelligence to simulate the most relevant threats to your company based on activity observed in your industry or region.</li></ul><h2 id="the-bottom-line-for-security-leaders">The Bottom Line for Security Leaders</h2><p>The organizations that will succeed in the years ahead won&#39;t be those collecting the most data, instead it will be the ones best equipped to turn that data into action. Recorded Future helps security teams beat the visibility paradox by providing the tools, automation, and intelligence needed to cut through the noise and focus on real threats before they impact your business.

            <description><![CDATA[Discover how cybercriminals use malicious Traffic Distribution Systems like TAG-124 to deliver ransomware and malware to high-value targets in healthcare and critical infrastructure.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coming across highly targeted advertisements online is a common experience for many US consumers. One way advertisers achieve this is by using traffic distribution systems (TDSs), which collect information about potential customers to <a href="https://www.securitee.org/files/tds-www2021.pdf" target="_blank">direct</a> them to highly targeted ads. Using data from the users browser, geolocation, and behavior, a TDS makes rapid decisions on directing traffic to get the most from ad spend. However, cybercriminals also use this infrastructure to deliver highly targeted malware to victims who are most likely to click their links. Malicious TDSs work in much the same way as legitimate TDSs, except they direct victims to the most effective malware instead of the most effective advertisement. Additionally, these TDSs provide a defensive measure to ensure the malware is not delivered to researchers or sandboxes that could analyze the code.</p><p>Insikt Group has been tracking how cybercriminals use these tools and <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/tag-124-multi-layered-tds-infrastructure-extensive-user-base" target="_blank">identified</a> infrastructure linked to a highly active malicious TDS dubbed TAG-124. TAG-124 allows ransomware operators and other cybercriminals to maximize their chances of infecting their intended victims with their respective payloads. At least two ransomware groups have been observed using TAG-124 to infect victims in health care and other critical infrastructure, demonstrating the value of traffic distribution for big game hunting (targeting companies perceived as likely to pay out high extortion demands). While shared infrastructure like TAG-124 helps cybercriminals improve their efficiency and effectiveness, understanding TAG-124 infrastructure can help defenders block or even disable activity from multiple cyber threat actors simultaneously before compromise occurs.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/hidden_01_4f5a2dd0de.png" alt="hidden-01.png"><em><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Multiple threat actors use TAG-124 to direct victims to their malware (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><h2 id="multiple-threat-actors-use-tag-124-infrastructure">Multiple Threat Actors Use TAG-124 Infrastructure</h2><p>Insikt Group has observed multiple threat actors using this malicious TDS, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Rhysida Ransomware:</strong> A sophisticated <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/outmaneuvering-rhysida-advanced-threat-intelligence-shields-critical-infrastructure-ransomware" target="_blank">ransomware-as-a-service</a> operation notable for extorting healthcare organizations and other critical infrastructure. In 2023, the group claimed responsibility for an attack on Prospect Medical Holdings, which <a href="https://www.scworld.com/news/rhysida-claims-responsibility-for-ransomware-attacks-on-prospect-medical-holdings" target="_blank">resulted</a> in the theft of over 500,000 social security numbers and <a href="https://blog.barracuda.com/2024/05/09/rhysida-ransomware--the-creepy-crawling-criminal-hiding-in-the-d#:~:text=The%20Prospect%20Medical%20Holdings%20attack%20impacted%2017%20hospitals%20and%20166%20clinics%20across%20the%20United%20States." target="_blank">impacted</a> operations at seventeen hospitals and 166 clinics. </li><li><strong>Interlock Ransomware:</strong> Another ransomware group targeting primarily <a href="https://www.hipaajournal.com/interlock-ransomware-healthcare/" target="_blank">healthcare organizations</a> and other big game to extort higher payouts through high-impact attacks on large organizations. In December 2024, the group <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/texas-tech-university-system-data-breach-impacts-14-million-patients/" target="_blank">claimed</a> credit for an attack on the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, stealing 2.6 TB of sensitive personal data. Interlock shares many similarities with Rhysida, such as tactics, tools, and encryption behaviors, though the exact relationship between the two is <a href="https://x.com/prodaft/status/1896938856672280591?s=43" target="_blank">unknown</a>.</li><li><strong>TA866 / Asylum Ambuscade:</strong> This cybercrime group <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2023/06/08/asylum-ambuscade-crimeware-or-cyberespionage/" target="_blank">engages in</a> financial targeting and cyber espionage very likely on behalf of the Russian government. The group has targeted bank customers and cryptocurrency traders across North America and Europe and carried out <a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/security-brief-ta866-returns-large-email-campaign" target="_blank">espionage</a> against government entities in Europe, Central Asia, and other areas.</li></ul><p>TAG-124 has also been associated with <a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/part-1-socgholish-very-real-threat-very-fake-update" target="_blank">SocGholish</a> and <a href="https://www.esentire.com/blog/exploring-the-d3f-ck-malware-as-a-service-loader" target="_blank">D3F@ck</a> loader malware, which provide remote access and malware delivery for financially motivated activity. While Insikt Group does not know which criteria TAG-124 uses to filter and direct malicious content, its use of search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning and infecting legitimate sites allows for an enormous number of potential victims. By outsourcing initial infection to TAG-124, groups like Rhysida and Interlock can pursue big game hunting by specializing in techniques implemented during a later stage in the infection kill chain. These special techniques enable more effective extortion campaigns.</p><h3 id="risk-outlook">Risk Outlook</h3><p>Successful big game hunting that results in large payouts allows sophisticated syndicates like Rhysida and Interlock to invest back into services that make their work more effective. This drives the increased specialization of groups like TAG-124, creating a virtuous cycle of cybercrime. As a result, businesses face an increasing risk of high-impact ransomware attacks and espionage-driven data theft: the links between TAG-124 and Asylum Ambuscade suggest that state-sponsored threat actors are also taking advantage of these services in addition to profit-motivated actors.</p><p>Defending against TAG-124 may be challenging due to its early role in the cyberattack life cycle, but missing intrusions early on can still have negative consequences for companies. For example, one of Rhysidas latest victims, Sunflower Medical, is <a href="https://www.hipaajournal.com/sunflower-medical-group-data-breach-lawsuit/" target="_blank">facing</a> a class action lawsuit because of its failure to implement security measures that would have detected the breach early in the infection cycle. According to the company, the intrusion was not discovered for three weeks following the initial breach. While it is unknown whether TAG-124 was used for this intrusion, the legal consequences demonstrate the significant risks of missing early signs of a breach.</p><h3 id="mitigations">Mitigations</h3><p>TAG-124 is not the only TDS operating on behalf of threat actors.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="what-we-can-learn-from-the-recent-news-about-the-unknown-future-of-mitres-cve-database">What We Can Learn From The Recent News About the Unknown Future of MITREs CVE Database</h2><p>Over the last several days, we have received a lot of inquiries from customers and partners about the recent news on the unknown future of the MITRE National Vulnerability (NVD) database. It is another reminder that in today&#39;s rapidly evolving cybersecurity environment, organizations cannot afford to rely on a single stream of intelligence. It also demonstrates why platforms that aggregate multiple intelligence sources are more critical than ever. </p><h2 id="when-critical-vulnerability-information-sources-are-at-risk">When Critical Vulnerability Information Sources Are at Risk</h2><p>We tend to think about supply chain disruptions related to physical goods, but this is a wake up call that information supply chains are equally important to consider. </p><p>So what happened? On April 15, 2025, a memo indicated that MITRE&#39;s contract to support CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) and related programs was set to expire on April 16, 2025. Fortunately, by 9am EDT on April 16, the MITRE contract had reportedly been renewed, and there would be no actual impact or interruptions to vulnerability intelligence services for at least a year- beyond that year is still unknown. While this raised immediate concerns across the cybersecurity community, it also illustrated the importance of diversified <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/vulnerability-intelligence" target="_blank">vulnerability intelligence</a> sources. </p><h2 id="why-multi-source-vulnerability-intelligence-matters">Why Multi-Source Vulnerability Intelligence Matters</h2><p>The MITRE situation perfectly exemplifies why organizations need robust, multi-source intelligence platforms rather than a dependency on single sources, namely:</p><h3 id="resilience-against-source-disruptions">Resilience Against Source Disruptions</h3><p>When a key intelligence source experiences disruption, organizations with diversified sources can maintain operational continuity.</p><h3 id="comprehensive-coverage">Comprehensive Coverage</h3><p>Different intelligence sources often capture different aspects of vulnerabilities. Vendor advisories might contain details not yet reflected in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD).</p><h3 id="timely-intelligence">Timely Intelligence</h3><p>Multiple sources allow for earlier detection of vulnerabilities, as information often appears in specialized forums or vendor bulletins before being officially cataloged.</p><h3 id="contextual-richness">Contextual Richness</h3><p>By aggregating multiple intelligence streams, organizations gain a more nuanced understanding of vulnerabilities, including real-world exploitation status.</p><h2 id="the-evolving-information-supply-chain">The Evolving Information Supply Chain</h2><p>The cybersecurity intelligence landscape has been undergoing a fundamental transformation for some time. In fact, this is the very reason Recorded Future was formed as a company nearly 15 years ago. Centralized information sources need to be complemented by a distributed network of intelligence mirroring the world. This shift represents a new paradigm in how security intelligence flows:</p><h3 id="from-centralized-to-distributed">From Centralized to Distributed</h3><p>Organizations are moving away from reliance on single, authoritative sources toward networks of complementary intelligence.</p><h3 id="from-reactive-to-proactive">From Reactive to Proactive</h3><p>Multi-source intelligence enables earlier detection and faster response to emerging threats.</p><h3 id="from-generic-to-contextual-and-precise">From Generic to Contextual and Precise</h3><p>Diverse sources provide richer context, allowing for more precise risk assessment tailored to specific organizational environments.</p><h2 id="practical-steps-for-security-teams">Practical Steps for Security Teams</h2><p>For security professionals, this shift necessitates adjustments in vulnerability management workflows:</p><h3 id="diversify-cve-sourcing-for-vendor-risk-ratings">Diversify CVE Sourcing for Vendor Risk Ratings</h3><p>Recorded Future automates risk alerting and tracking, including CVEs by severity. Beyond MITRE NVD&#39;s CVSS scores, we incorporate proprietary and open source scoring and data. This has enabled us to alert on vulnerabilities, <strong>an average of 11 days</strong>, before NVD even computes their risk scores, as exemplified in the screenshot from our platform.</p><p><em>The screenshot from our platform below of a Recorded Future alert captured before NVD scoring - providing early warning signals of potential risk.</em></p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/mitre_cve_001_cdc2f7d670.png" alt="mitre-cve-001.png"></p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/mitre_cve_002_bcc5dd14f8.png" alt="mitre-cve-002.png"></p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/mitre_cve_003_db17934b15.png" alt="mitre-cve-003.png"></p><p>Evaluate Source Dependencies</p><p>Review current intelligence sources to identify potential single points of failure in your security information supply chain.</p><p>Implement Resilient Workflows</p><p>Design vulnerability management processes that can adapt to changes in intelligence sources without operational disruption.</p><p>Know How to Action the Data</p><p>Having a robust and resilient information supply chain is important, but equally important is knowing what to action on and how to do it. <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform/demo-center" target="_blank">Actionable intelligence</a> is the only intelligence that matters. Organizations require additional detail on the exposures and tactics along with specific threat hunting packages. (See screen shot below of a TTP validated by our Insikt group research team along with the attached YAML threat hunt package to eradicate it.)</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/mitre_cve_004_b8957d2c05.png" alt="mitre-cve-004.png"></p><h2 id="conclusion-the-power-of-intelligence-integration">Conclusion: The Power of Intelligence Integration</h2><p>The recent MITRE contract situation serves as a timely reminder that in cybersecurity intelligence, diversity and integration are strengths. It is very likely that additional community and open sources will emerge to expose and track this information, which will be great incremental sources. Organizations that leverage platforms capable of aggregating, normalizing, and contextualizing intelligence from multiple sources gain significant advantages in risk identification, prioritization, and mitigation. They are also more protected from disruptions related to any one particular source. This is supply chain management 101. </p><p>Even better is when the platform can automate and proactively take action based on a wide variety of intelligence sourcing. As information supply chains continue to evolve, the most resilient security postures will belong to those organizations that embrace multi-source intelligence platformsensuring that when one source experiences disruption, the flow of critical security intelligence and automation continues uninterrupted. </p><p>Recorded Future will continue help on this mission in every way we can. In addition to CVE information, we track over 4,000 threat actors, including 430 nation-state sponsored groups, and a variety of other sources of threats used in our analysis and recommendations. We actively monitor more than 90,000 command and control servers while scanning 30 million domains and URLs each day. We make some of this available for free in our public vulnerability database site, where you can see trending vulnerabilities and search for CVEs and software: <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/vulnerability-database" target="_blank">https://www.recordedfuture.com/vulnerability-database</a></p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/mitre_cve_006_ba6e6ce748.png" alt="mitre-cve-006.png"></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt group logo"></p><h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2><p>Iran recognizes the vital role artificial intelligence (AI) will play in its future economic viability, regional influence, and national security and has begun to implement a top-down effort to achieve regional technological competitiveness. Since the Supreme Leader issued a directive in 2021, Iran has endeavored to develop a national strategy and oversight mechanism for AI and foster a technological ecosystem to drive domestic research and development. However, two key factors  Tehrans global economic isolation, and its deeply entrenched system of government control and oversight  have almost certainly hindered Irans national AI development. </p><p>In 2024, as Tehrans support for its proxies Hamas and Hezbollah against Israel embroiled Iran in unprecedented regional conflicts and ongoing cyberwarfare, new insights emerged about how Iran has implemented AI technologies in its national security apparatus. Iran has used AI to bolster its capabilities in four main areas: cyberattacks, influence operations, military and intelligence systems, and domestic repression. These priorities will continue to propel Irans development and implementation of AI, almost certainly posing an increasing threat to Irans Western and regional adversaries. In cyberspace, AI will likely augment Iranian threat actors spearphishing and social engineering tradecraft, while AIs implementation in Irans drone and missile arsenal is likely to pose the greatest physical threat from emerging technology.</p><p>Irans approach to AI will likely mirror its broader strategic ambitions  to be a regional power and assert its national sovereignty  by building and implementing advanced technological capabilities. Iranian government initiatives are likely to be the driving force behind Irans AI development priorities, particularly given the absence of a flourishing AI private sector. While Tehran will promote its own technological prowess and indigenous AI development, the Iranian government is likely to leverage its relationship with China and Russia in various security realms to bolster its AI technology capabilities. Private industry, particularly companies in the AI or technology resources industry, should closely monitor end users of their models or materials to ensure Iranian threat actors are not using their products or acquiring controlled technologies. Similarly, governments should invest in identifying and preventing the Iranian defense industry from acquiring AI technologies that enhance its military capabilities. </p><h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2><ul><li>Iran has articulated lofty goals for its AI advancement and seeks to compete in the global AI race, but it is almost certainly hindered by two factors: First, its economic and commercial isolation limits its access to technological resources and human capital. Second, its top-down government control and oversight stifles private innovation in AI.</li><li>To augment its own indigenous research and development (R&amp;D) capabilities in AI, Iran will likely leverage its bilateral and regional relationships for technology engagement with China, Russia, and other non-Western countries.</li><li>Amidst unprecedented domestic upheaval and regional conflict over the last three years, Iran very likely views AI as a key force multiplier for its national security and defense and has sought to integrate AI into its cyber and influence operations, military systems, and domestic surveillance infrastructure.</li><li>It is very likely that Iranian threat actors will increasingly use generative AI and large language models (LLMs) to enhance their influence and cyber operations, increasing risk to adversarial governments, as well as their critical infrastructure, technology companies, and other security-related industries. </li><li>Iran has very likely endeavored to implement AI in its military defense systems and publicly touts the capability, though its operational uses of the technologies remain unproven.</li><li>In the domestic sphere, Iran has very likely increased its efforts to deploy AI for morality enforcement and opposition monitoring, to enhance its control over Iranian society, particularly after the Woman Life Freedom protest movement.</li><li>Companies and governments should maintain vigilance in cybersecurity practices to reduce vulnerabilities to AI-enabled cyber and influence operations and limit Irans access to AI resources and expertise that could increase Tehrans threat to regional security.</li></ul><h2 id="irans-ai-ambitions">Irans AI Ambitions</h2><p>At the highest level of its leadership, Iran has recognized and sought to develop an overarching national focus on AI (   in Persian). In November 2021, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei called AI an important and futuristic issue that will play a role in the future administration of the world, and <a href="https://www.memri.org/reports/irans-supreme-leader-khamenei-we-must-master-all-layers-artificial-intelligence-technology" target="_blank">urged</a> Iran to become a top ten country in the field of AI. In August 2024, Khamenei urged Iran to master and develop the deep and diverse layers of AI technology, warning that a global oversight body (similar to the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]) might regulate its use in the future. Khameneis stated ambition for Irans AI prominence initiated a flurry of government-led activity to develop and implement a national strategy and technological ecosystem to align with the Supreme Leaders intent. Iran subsequently began creating a national AI roadmap that evaluated the strategic documents of 23 countries in the field of AI and developed a plan to realize Khameneis goal by 2032. The goals of the roadmap document were to achieve 80 percent of research to meet the needs of the country, use of 45 percent of AI in industries, $8 billion investment in AI, and a 12 percent share of AI in the GDP.&quot; The document contained fourteen macro policies, 47 micro-policies, 39 general actions, and 155 projects and activities. According to the roadmap, by the Persian year 1410 (starting March 2031), Iran would need to train 600,000 experts in the AI field to accomplish these objectives.</p><p>Irans presidency  specifically, the Vice Presidency for Science, Technology and Knowledge-based Economy  oversees the Iranian governments effort to establish and implement an AI strategy. On December 3, 2023, President Ebrahim Raisi issued an executive order to establish the National Steering Committee and the National Artificial Intelligence (AI) Center, which would focus on creating integrated AI processing and data service providers, aligning with the countrys needs, and implementing large-scale AI projects.&quot;  He appointed Reshad Hosseini as Secretary for the Development of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Headquarters, a role intended to develop a technology development roadmap and to make maximum use of all the internal capacity of the innovation ecosystem.&quot; Irans AI Strategic Council was to be formed of ministers and heads of relevant institutions to implement, coordinate, and monitor a National AI Document.</p><p>After Raisis death in May 2024, the administration of President Masoud Pezeshkian has continued to emphasize Irans AI strategy. The National AI Organization (or the National Organization for AI) was inaugurated in July 2024 in Tehran. Insikt Group identified the organizations physical location in north central Tehran, on Molla Sadra Street (Figures 1-3). During Pezeshkians endorsement ceremony and National Government Week meeting in August 2024, Khamenei advised the new administration that the good initiative begun under deceased President Raisi unfortunately remains unfinished, but advised that the National AI Organization, under the direct supervision of the President, should continue Raisis progress. On October 15, 2024, Irans Information Technology Council issued a decision that within two months, the National Organization of Artificial Intelligence should present to the working group the requirements for creating, developing, maintaining and publishing data and information in the hyper scale database of artificial intelligence.&quot; </p><p>Pezeshkian appointed Hossein Afshin, a professor of mechanical engineering at Sharif University of Technology, as his Vice President for Science, Technology, and Knowledge-based Economy, who also serves as the secretary and vice president of the National AI Organization and serves as the face of AI development within Iran. Pezeshkian also assigned his First Vice President, Dr. Mohammad Reza Aref, as chairman of the National AI Organization and its strategic council. Arefs appointment as First Vice President <a href="https://amwaj.media/en/media-monitor/critics-slam-return-of-lord-of-silence-as-iran-s-first-vice-president" target="_blank">prompted</a> criticism for his political obscurity, likely reflecting Pezeshkians choice for the position was based on his scientific prowess and technical acuity rather than his accomplishments as a reformist politician. The prominent role of Aref  who holds two advanced degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University, has been a professor at two prestigious Iranian universities, and has <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37300306900" target="_blank">published</a> scholarly articles on information technology  as Pezeshkians deputy with oversight of the countrys AI program suggests an increasing recognition of the importance of AI.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/iran_ai_001_6bd6d1d62b.png" alt="iran-ai-001.png"><em><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Inauguration of Irans National Artificial Intelligence Organization in Tehran (Source: Mehr News)</em></p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/iran_ai_002_dc5f600753.png" alt="iran-ai-002.png"><em><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Exterior of the National Artificial Intelligence Organization (Source: <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/GN4RRv5iSHZNqmbT7" target="_blank">Google Maps</a>)</em></p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/iran_ai_003_023523ac12.png" alt="iran-ai-003.png"><em><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Location of the National Artificial Intelligence Organization (Source: <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/GN4RRv5iSHZNqmbT7" target="_blank">Google Maps</a>)</em></p><h2 id="laying-the-foundations-of-an-ai-ecosystem">Laying the Foundations of an AI Ecosystem</h2><p>Insikt Group examined Iranian government statements, press releases, leadership speeches, academic journals, industry websites, and news media, all of which provide key insights into the development and deployment of AI in Iran. However, these sources often provide broad knowledge about Irans ambitions or intentions regarding AI and lack details on the specific models, technology, or deployment of AI in support of national security objectives. Western AI companies, such as OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft, as well as global cybersecurity and military experts, offer additional perspectives and analysis of Irans AI use cases.</p><h3 id="national-ai-strategy-development-and-challenges">National AI Strategy Development and Challenges</h3><p>Following its leaders 2021 directive, the Islamic Republic has striven to develop and integrate AI through the establishment of various bureaucratic entities and industry initiatives. Irans progress in AI advancement is almost certainly limited by two factors: (1) its economic and commercial isolation and (2) its government control and oversight. After years of international sanctions and commercial isolation, Irans technological advancement, particularly in security-related industries such as defense, energy, and maritime shipping, depends on indigenous and domestically engineered capabilities.  Iran <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/iransource/iran-s-troubled-quest-for-food-self-sufficiency/" target="_blank">strives</a> for self-sufficiency in various sectors, including food and energy, and this concept of a resistance economy, which <a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/khamenei-attempts-restore-optimism-and-normality-nowruz-speeches" target="_blank">underpins</a> Iranian strategic culture and economic development priorities, very likely shapes the development of Irans AI ecosystem. The Iranian government almost certainly <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/iranian-studies/article/artificial-intelligence-in-iran-national-narratives-and-material-realities/9D2C33F3F1BC459712651443F1D203FB" target="_blank">disseminates</a> the narrative that Iran is a competitor in an AI global race and seeks to prove its technological prowess. As a result of Irans national ambitions for AI, its development ecosystem is very likely government-driven, in partnership with private industry and academia. Iranian technological leaders very likely understand that foreign advances in AI computing power, including private technology companies, can both benefit and augment Irans own internal efforts and uses. This dynamic  a top-down national strategy and AI technical development framework that is supported rather than driven by Irans own private sector innovation  is likely to limit the potential of Irans AI advances.</p><p>Irans own private sector innovation is likely stifled by its economic isolation and its dependencies on government funding and direction. Iran claims that the governments expanded support to the tech sector resulted in a surge of Iranian venture capital firms, accelerators, and innovation centers between 2019 and 2020, as these firms provided localized solutions amid global supply chain disruption (after the US withdrew from the Iran nuclear agreement and re-imposed sanctions).  However, according to a 2022 United Nations <a href="https://www.undp.org/publications/mapping-existing-innovation-ecosystem-ir-iran" target="_blank">report</a> on Irans innovation landscape, sanctions significantly hampered Irans startup ecosystem and the domestic and foreign appetite for investments in Iranian technology startups after 2018 was reduced substantially. Irans challenges and limitations are reflected in several global indices that analyze and measure AI advances and technological innovation across countries. Stanford Universitys Global AI Vibrancy Tool, which <a href="https://hai-production.s3.amazonaws.com/files/global_ai_vibrancy_tool_08.27.24.pdf" target="_blank">defines</a> AI vibrancy as the level of activity, development, and impact of AI technologies within a country, does not include Iran in its analysis of 36 countries leading AI-related metrics. Iran is ranked 64th in the Global Innovation Index, which <a href="" target="_blank">reflects</a> a notable improvement over the last ten years. However, Irans institutional, regulatory, and business environments ranked 127th, 131st, and 128th, respectively, underscoring the systemic challenges to Irans innovation ecosystem. Oxford Insights <a href="https://www.wipo.int/web-publications/global-innovation-index-2024/assets/67729/2000%20Global%20Innovation%20Index%202024_WEB3lite.pdf" target="_blank">ranked</a> Iran 91st of 193 countries in the 2024 Government AI Readiness Index, a three-position improvement from its 2023 ranking, but scored lowest in the vision, adaptability, and maturity dimensions.</p><p>In 2022, Iran revealed fifteen policies shaping its AI development roadmap. A key theme underpinning these policies was the importance of national research centers, private industries, and universities working together to advance Irans AI development. Notably, two of the policies sought to support the private industrys use of academic plans and to increase private industrys trust in universities, likely suggesting a divide between Irans technical industry and its academic institutions. Another key theme of the policies was increasing foreign engagement and cooperation between Iranian and foreign academic centers. This likely reflects Irans interest in leveraging foreign partnerships, particularly with countries that are adversarial to the West, in the AI field.</p><p>In July 2023, a study from the Journal of Science &amp; Technology Policy found that the artificial intelligence ecosystem in [Iran] has not yet taken shape in the true sense and there is still no relative consensus among actors for dividing tasks and missions.&quot; Less than a year later, the same journal  which is affiliated with Irans National Science Policy Research Center  published a Nowruz 1403 (Persian new year, corresponding with March 2024) special edition entitled Generative Artificial Intelligence: Multiple Perspectives on Opportunities, Challenges, and Implications in Research, Practice, and Policymaking that examined the abundant ethical and legal opportunities and challenges of AI, specifically ChatGPTs practical, ethical, semantic, and policy challenges.&quot; The studys conclusion highlighted the lack of well-developed ethical guidelines and noted that it is vital that new rules be established to govern these instruments, and given their global nature, international coordination is also necessary to maximize their benefits. The 43 expert authors from various business and technological fields disagreed about whether ChatGPT should be restricted or legalized in Iran.</p><p>Irans bureaucratic challenges in the AI realm, including changes in presidential administrations and a plethora of organizational stakeholders with overlapping responsibilities, likely limit the countrys ability to implement an overarching strategy for its AI development. Tehrans policy toward AI is overseen by Irans Supreme Council of the Cultural Revolution (SCCR)  a strategic policy body that answers only to the Supreme Leader  whose approval in June 2024 was required to move forward with the National AI Organization, steering council, and the documents generalities. This approval involved review of the AI organizations statutes and 18,000 supporting documents to ensure the project was not tainted by Western influence. The SCCR established a specialized Commission for AI in September 2022 composed of officials from all armed forces branches, the General Staff of the Armed Forces, the Office of the Supreme Leader, the Ministry of Intelligence, and the Ministry of Higher Education. In January 2025, Pezeshkian noted the importance of AI development in a meeting with the SCCR, asserting that any delay or backwardness in the development of AI in Iran would be damaging and irreparable. Domestic critics of Irans AI policy have raised concerns about the unstable decisions, constant policy changes, and lack of a clear roadmap that has hampered the countrys AI program. For example, in December 2024, Afshin announced that the cabinet was drafting a charter for the National AI Organization that would focus on the organizations role in planning and overseeing AI activities; three months later, semi-official news agency Tasnim News suggested the possibility that the National AI Organization could be dissolved, raising a series of contradictions and unanswered ambiguity.  </p><h3 id="ai-budget">AI Budget</h3><p>Documentation of Irans investment and funding of AI is opaque, but even with conflicting information, Irans lack of significant AI funding compared to its competitors will likely imperil its top-ten AI ambitions. The SCCR reportedly allocated a budget totaling 3.5 trillion Tomans (over 83 million dollars) in its approval; Irans initial operating budget for AI has also been reported as $50 million USD.  According to the Tehran Times, 50 trillion rials (some $100 million) has been allocated for the development of AI operators during Persian year 1403 (between March 2024 and March 2025). In January 2025, Irans National Development Fund  independent of the Iranian government budget  agreed to allocate $15.6 million USD to AI projects in universities and private research centers, while another $100 million USD will be provided in the form of loans. These funding numbers lag significantly behind the AI budgets of regional competitors like the United Arab Emirates (approximately $1.2 billion USD) and Saudi Arabia (approximately $2 billion USD). </p><h3 id="government-entities">Government Entities</h3><p>Insikt Group identified a number of government entities that are involved in the direction, strategic planning, and national coordination for the development of Irans AI capabilities. The protracted process for the formulation of Irans national AI strategy document, which has <a href="https://ideaagency.net/irans-advancements-in-ai-collaboration-on-national-strategy/" target="_blank">involved</a> a cross-agency collaboration process with multiple stakeholders, likely reflects a bureaucratic competition for influence and ownership of AI leadership within the Iranian government.

Iranian armed forces, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), have <a href="https://cira.exovera.com/research-analysis/irgcs-involvement-in-science-technology-parks-blurs-line-between-civilian-military/" target="_blank">affiliated</a> universities and science and technology (S&amp;T) parks and run their own technology parks as incubators. For example, Imam Hossein University  affiliated with the IRGC  has a technology center and hosted The International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and the Future Civilization on January 29, 2025. Irans military branches from the Army and IRGCs ground, naval, and air forces each have their own research and development entity, <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-58649-1_19" target="_blank">referred</a> to as a Research Self-Sufficiency and Jihad Organization (RSSJO), that conducts specialized and tailored R&amp;D for the unique needs of their respective forces. These RSSJOs are likely involved in independent efforts in defense-related R&amp;D and in cooperation with academic institutions; they are likely integrating AI development into those efforts. Irans Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL) also likely has a key role in defense-related AI development, having signed partnership agreements with 80 universities and 800 industrial towns in Iran.</p><h3 id="government-initiatives">Government Initiatives</h3><p>Announcements by the Vice Presidency for Science, Technology and Knowledge-based Economy regarding its AI development initiatives likely suggest Iran is working to develop a sovereign AI capability  meaning an Iranian national capability to <a href="https://aimagazine.com/articles/what-is-sovereign-ai-and-why-is-it-gaining-traction" target="_blank">produce</a> AI using its own infrastructure, data, workforce, and business networks through the development of foundation models trained on local datasets that reflect local language and culture. Hossein Afshin, Irans Vice President for Science, Technology and Knowledge-based Economy, hosted a meeting with the Technology Group from Tarbiat Modarres University on December 1, 2024, during which he reviewed the teams progress, requirements, and support mechanisms for its Project for Designing a Large Native Iranian Language Model. He subsequently announced on December 3, 2024, that a prototype of Irans national AI operating system, which was designed to host AI algorithms locally, was expected in six months. Iran intends to launch the countrys first GPU data center by 2025 and plans to establish its first AI park  to showcase the technological developments of the country and provide practical AI-related services to the people  within the next two years.</p><p>On March 15, 2025, Vice President Afshin unveiled Irans national AI platform and announced a phased rollout of the project, framing it as a strategic move in a global war of chips and algorithms. The platforms initial testing and optimization are planned for the first half of 2025, followed by limited access for technology experts and companies in the third quarter, a public beta release in September 2025, culminating with a public release in approximately March 2026. Over 100 Iranian professors and researchers collaborated on the project, which was developed in cooperation with Sharif University of Technology  an institution that is <a href="https://www.opensanctions.org/entities/NK-nxBVUwhmE8JFVPkiVzKVaS/" target="_blank">sanctioned</a> for its links to the IRGC and MODAFL related to military and ballistic missile technology development.  An expert developer and representative of Sharif University, Hossein Asadi, noted that the AI platform was developed using an open-source framework and specifically highlighted that it would be entirely independent, with no reliance on foreign APIs [application programming interfaces], ensuring the platforms services would continue without disruption even if the countrys internet were to be completely disconnected.</p><p>Iran almost certainly seeks to leverage domestic resources to support these development initiatives. On December 13, 2024, Afshin declared the governments intention to jumpstart domestic chip production for AI through the Sahand National Project (  ). The Sahand National Project is consistent with Irans focus on leveraging its own human and natural resources to deliver indigenous technological solutions and is likely a reaction to an anticipated increase in economic isolation under the US presidential administration of Donald Trump. The US government <a href="https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2025/01/13/fact-sheet-ensuring-u-s-security-and-economic-strength-in-the-age-of-artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank">announced</a> export restrictions on January 13, 2025, which are designed to curtail the sale of chips with high-computational graphics processing unit (GPU) power for AI advanced development (such as Nvidias A100 and H100 chips) to sanctioned countries like Iran. </p><p>According to Iranian media, the projects aim is to manufacture nine-nines (99.9999999%) purity silicon wafers, the first step in setting up a domestic supply chain for microchips, with a view to open Irans first GPU data center by early 2025. While public information on the project remains limited, its reported location  in Sahand, East Azerbaijan province  would likely have been chosen for its proximity to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sahand-industrial-group" target="_blank">Sahand Industrial Group</a> (SIG), Irans leading glass and silica producer, and the Sahand University of Technology, which has specialized laboratories in material and nanomaterial engineering. Using satellite imagery, Insikt Group identified a new two-million-square-foot facility under construction near an existing SIG silica manufacturing plant in Sahand, showing significant investment in the regions industrial capabilities.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/iran_ai_004_ab2b738eab.png" alt="iran-ai-004.png"><em><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Satellite imagery of a two-million square foot facility between May 2020 and May 2024 near an SIG silica plant in Sahand, East Azerbaijan, Iran (Source: <a href="https://earth.google.com/web/@37.98555449,46.05734324,1318.43207051a,2331.38762272d,35y,356.98663711h,0t,0r/data=ChYqEAgBEgoyMDIwLTA1LTEzGAFCAggBMikKJwolCiExRjlFYTB2c1g5MUJONlFrSGlxZUlYTTZKckFvSEpWcGQgAToDCgEwQgIIAEoICJag4dgDEAE" target="_blank">Google Earth</a>)</em></p><p>Another government initiative announced on January 11, 2025, by Afshin aims to establish a hub for AI innovation in the oil and gas industries on Kish Island, Southern Iran, in association with the Persian Gulf Petrochemical Industries Company and the Kish Free Zone Organization. The location choice likely enables the Iranian government to unlock three benefits for the acceleration of AI development: the Kish Free Zones lax foreign investment and fiscal policies to encourage foreign direct investments (FDI); existing infrastructure, including an international airport and ports that can be leveraged for international transit; and lax entry visa requirements on Kish Island that <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Iran.html" target="_blank">enable</a> reputable Iranian academic institutions (such as Sharif University of Technology, which has an international campus in Kish) to attract foreign talent and investment.</p><p>Iran has announced several AI-enabled tools for the benefit of the Iranian government and society. Alongside his announcement of Irans domestic chip production project in December 2024, Afshin also declared that the Iranian government has prioritized the development of AI assistants available to government officials, developed in collaboration with universities with a team of over 70 expert professors. The AI assistants are reportedly expected to help government ministers to extract both laws and regulations and production-related issues from data and make suggestions in decision-making. In August 2024, Irans National Cyberspace Center announced the Arbaeen Artificial Intelligence Assistant (which references Arbaeen, a Shiite holy day, during which Shia Muslims <a href="https://www.newarab.com/features/explainer-what-arbaeen" target="_blank">make</a> a pilgrimage to Iraq) was a guide for pilgrims to access routes and processions, management of information for scheduling ceremonies and events, as well as the status of health and medical services, weather conditions, and even cultural and linguistic guidance online. In November 2024, Irans national religious headquarters, located at Qom Seminary, launched an indigenously developed platform that uses AI to answer questions and remove doubts on religious issues. Dubbed Deendaan, the platform was introduced by the seminarys National Center for Answering Religious Questions. Another entity in Qom, the Noor Computer Centre for Islamic Sciences Research, is seeking to <a href="https://archive.is/npvsM#selection-2349.43-2349.93" target="_blank">incorporate</a> AI in its use of religious texts and data to accelerate the Islamic studies of senior clergy and speed up their communication to the public. </p><h3 id="academia">Academia</h3><p>Irans most globally recognized AI innovation, the Surena IV humanoid robot, was developed by Irans academic sector, underscoring the key role of universities and research institutes in Irans AI ecosystem. Created at the Center of Advanced Systems and Technologies (CAST) at the University of Tehran, the robots fourth generation uses the Robot Operating System for state monitoring, real time implementation of algorithms, and simultaneous running of several programs. The robot was <a href="https://www.asme.org/topics-resources/content/10-humanoid-robots-of-2020" target="_blank">listed</a> as one of the top ten humanoid robots in 2020, according to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. In addition to developing the Surena humanoid, CAST has a portfolio of projects related to various fields, including mechatronics, robotics, and intelligent systems inspired by nature, as well as aquatic inspired robots and those inspired by birds.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/iran_ai_005_ab855d70a9.png" alt="iran-ai-005.png"><em><strong>Figure 5:</strong> Surena IV, developed at the University of Tehran (Source: <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/iran-surena-iv-humanoid-robot" target="_blank">IEEE</a>)</em></p><p>Leading Iranian universities in the field of AI <a href="https://edurank.org/cs/ai/ir/" target="_blank">include</a> the University of Tehran, Amirkabir University of Technology, and Iran University of Science and Technology, all located in Tehran. According to the state-run news outlet Tehran Times, over the last ten years, the most scientific productions in artificial intelligence have been associated with Tehran University, Tabriz University, and Amirkabir University of Technology. However, these universities likely remain low on global rankings for AI research; the University of Tehran, widely recognized as the best higher education institution in Iran, <a href="https://edurank.org/uni/university-of-tehran/rankings/" target="_blank">ranks</a> at number 201 globally for AI. Edurank data suggests that Irans top three universities are ahead or on par with their Russian peers (Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University, and the National Research University) but far behind China (Tsinghua University, Harbin Institute of Technology, and Shanghai Jiao Tong University) in terms of production (number of publications) and influence (number of citations). Iranian national investment in AI research is likely less than Russian investment, but its academic citation numbers are greater than Russias, likely reflecting that Irans AI academics maintain disproportionate influence in their field relative to their Russian counterparts.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/iran_ai_006_8ad8b5bb07.png" alt="iran-ai-006.png"><em><strong>Figure 6:</strong> Top three universities in Iran, Russia, and China by papers and citations in the field of AI (Source: <a href="https://edurank.org/cs/ai/" target="_blank">Edurank</a>)</em></p><p>In the absence of a vibrant private AI sector, the Iranian government is likely reliant on academics specialized in AI for government projects at the expense of cutting-edge research. Iranian media boasted that 70 expert professors were working to design an AI platform for government ministers. Sharif University of Technology, ranked fourth in Iran in AI, is likely a key partner for government projects, such as Irans national AI platform. The government demand for expertise likely represents a misallocation of research talent towards state-mandated engineering projects, which likely impedes Irans research potential. However, Iranian academic centers may also be exploring open-source AI development, which likely encourages innovation. For example, in November 2024, Amirkabir University, in collaboration with AI developer Part AI, announced the development of the most comprehensive and powerful evaluation system for Persian language models, known as <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/PartAI/open-persian-llm-leaderboard" target="_blank">Open Persian LLM Leaderboard</a>, which includes over 40,000 samples and tracks the performance of 25 major open-source models at Persian-language tasks. Part AI has also published six open-source models, including Persian finetunes of Metas Llama 3.1 and Googles BERT models.</p><p>A search of recent and upcoming conferences related to AI suggests Irans academic sector is exploring AI applications in several sectors, including medical sciences, telecommunications, electrical engineering, education, mining, and industry. In 2024, Iran held a number of inaugural national conferences on specific topics, very likely suggesting the concept of how AI can benefit specific industrial sectors is still nascent in Iran. For example, in October 2024, Iran held the first national conference on AI in education and learning; in May 2024, Iran held its first national conference on AI and the Internet of Things; in April 2024, it held its second national conference on Digital Transformation and Intelligent Systems.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/iran_ai_007_cc46a37180.png" alt="iran-ai-007.png"><em><strong>Figure 7:</strong> Poster of international AI conference which notes the cooperation with prestigious universities and scientific centers of Iran and the world (Source: Imam Hossein University)</em></p><p>Iranian universities are very likely driving international engagement by hosting conferences on AI. A review of international AI-related conferences held in Iran in 2024 and planned for 2025 highlights a wide range of foreign academic participants, including academics from Austria, Australia, Canada, China, France, Italy, Iraq, Malaysia, Russia, Spain, Vietnam, and the United Kingdom.   Iranian academic output on AI likely benefits from strong ties with Iranian-American researchers and collaboration with US academic institutions. An Iranian study of domestic output of AI research between 1978 and 2022 found that US researchers were the most frequent international co-authors on Iranian AI research. However, Iranian academic AI research likely remains of limited international influence. 19.9% of Iranian AI papers during this period received no citations, with the majority receiving between one and five citations.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/iran_ai_008_803597413b.png" alt="iran-ai-008.png"><em><strong>Figure 8:</strong> Network map of countries co-authoring with Iranian AI researchers between 1978 and 2022, based on the Scopus database (Source: Shahed University)</em></p><h3 id="private-technology-companies">Private Technology Companies</h3><p>Irans private sector currently faces significant challenges in the face of international sanctions and lack of global competitiveness, including the inability to retain top talent, the absence of foundational AI model companies, low capital expenditures on AI by existing major players in the technology sphere, and a nascent venture capital (VC) ecosystem.</p><p>Iran almost certainly <a href="https://www.mei.edu/publications/escalating-emigration-and-drought-irans-it-industry" target="_blank">suffers</a> from a significant talent outflow of skilled workers in technology and AI. According to a 2021 report by the Iran Migration Observatory, 50% of Iranians <a href="https://www.mei.edu/publications/escalating-emigration-and-drought-irans-it-industry" target="_blank">involved</a> in startup communities and 44% of graduates were planning on emigrating, citing unpredictable internet regulations, censorship, and lack of wage competitiveness as direct factors. In December 2024, Irans Vice President Afshin announced a new regulation offering monthly grants of approximately 15 million Tomans ($3,564 USD) for PhD students to encourage research and scientific activities, stressing the importance of preventing talent migration.</p><p>Despite talent shortages, Indian data provider TraxCN has <a href="https://tracxn.com/d/artificial-intelligence/ai-startups-in-iran/__aWyQstgrq_MtBd_T7d2d9-itkASMubg8G_HbLca8W_8/companies" target="_blank">identified</a> at least 85 companies in Iran advertised as operating in the field of AI, with a majority focusing on developing AI enterprise applications and tools for healthcare, agriculture, and finance. Several companies provide chatbot services and LLMs, including Persian-language chatbots; however, it remains unclear whether they are developing proprietary models rather than deploying existing open-source models. Additionally, TraxCN considers that seventeen (20%) of these companies are currently deadpooled (no longer in business) and 60 (80.5%) remain unfunded, indicating that despite government efforts to incentivize AI startups, the average Iranian AI startup is doomed to fail in raising funds or operating sustainably. Iranian AI website Hooshio published a list of 29 Iranian AI companies, highlighting the Parth AI Research Center as one of the top five companies in the Middle East with more than 150 specialists in AI. The company claims to have Irans biggest AI research center with a department for machine vision, natural language processing (NLP), speech processing, and data analysis, as well as an AI college. </p><p>Irans private tech sector is likely trying to financially motivate AI innovation and engage with Irans developer community. Digikala, Irans <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organizations/location_identifiers/iran" target="_blank">biggest</a> technology and e-commerce company (valued at approximately $500 million USD as of August 2024), <a href="https://archive.ph/c9swn" target="_blank">hosted</a> an AI hackathon in March 2024 with a first-place prize of 60 million Tomans (approximately $14,258 USD). Notably, the hackathons rules <a href="https://archive.ph/c9swn" target="_blank">banned</a> participants from using Western AI models (listing models from Western companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere), likely intending for participants to focus on using open-source models for hackathon entries.</p><p>Unlike their Western and Chinese counterparts, Iranian VC funds are likely limited in their ability to fund and support a domestic AI startup ecosystem to fulfill national security and economic priorities, with startups <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/fmo/capital-raising/traditional-capital-raising/venture-capital/iran" target="_blank">forecasted</a> to raise $28.13 million USD in capital in 2025 across all sectors. Irans Pardis Technology Park (PTP), dubbed Iran Silicon Valley and operating under the auspices of the Vice Presidency for Science, Technology, and Knowledge-based Economy, is the most significant center for developing startups and knowledge-based companies and commercialization of technology and innovations in Iran. PTP, which is part of the Iran International Innovation District, boasts 25.5 million EUR of foreign investments in its companies over the last five years and is also supported by the Iran National Innovation Fund, Irans version of a venture capital and private equity firm. </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/iran_ai_009_300bca3ba4.png" alt="iran-ai-009.png"><em><strong>Figure 9:</strong> Forecasted capital raised by startups for 2025 in China, Russia, and Iran (Source: Statista <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/fmo/capital-raising/traditional-capital-raising/venture-capital/china#:~:text=The%20country%20in%20China%20is,US%2449.17bn%20in%202025." target="_">1<a/>, <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/fmo/capital-raising/traditional-capital-raising/venture-capital/russia#:~:text=Russia%20is%20projected%20to%20see,US%240.27bn%20in%202025." target="_">2</a>, <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/fmo/capital-raising/traditional-capital-raising/venture-capital/iran" target="_">3</a>)</em></p><h3 id="open-source">Open Source</h3><p>Open-source communities <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-opportunities-action-plan-government-response/ai-opportunities-action-plan-government-response" target="_blank">play</a> an important role in the development of AI capabilities, as open-source AI models can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190226132342id_/http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/71bc/34f9611e020e5d673b03af354d45b022018d.pdf" target="_blank">lower</a> research and development costs, present opportunities for technology transfers, and reduce dependency on models developed by foreign companies. Irans open-source community almost certainly lags behind in terms of developing home-grown AI models, finetunes, and datasets. Data from open-source AI model platform HuggingFace shows that Farsi-language models (including multilingual models from US AI companies) are outnumbered by open-source models with language capabilities for Mandarin, Korean, or Russian. Sanctions are almost certainly <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2404.05489v1" target="_blank">throttling</a> the emergence of a strong Iranian open-source software community.

ODISTC was set up to serve as a foundation for increasing scientific, technological and innovation communications with other countries, as well as securing a significant share of the regional and global trade of knowledge-based products. Among the services offered in ODISTCs Technological Exchange Office is bilateral scientific and technology cooperation in the form of joint research funds with the [sic] countries like China and Russia. More details pertaining to Irans cooperation with China and Russia are discussed below. </p><h4 id="china">China</h4><p>Irans technological cooperation with China is very likely a key strategic interest for Irans AI development. In 2021, Irans Strategic Council on Foreign Relations promoted building relationships between Iranian and Chinese technology companies and higher education institutions. AI was specifically mentioned as part of the Iran-China 25-year Comprehensive Partnership, officially signed in March 2021. A leaked version of the plan, sourced from Irans Ministry of Foreign Affairs and <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/media/uploads/documents/MEP_200831_OCC%2038%20v3%20%281%29.pdf" target="_blank">reported</a> by the Wilson Center, proposed the cooperation involved introducing joint pilot projects in the fields of smart technology and artificial intelligence. Second to the sale of its oil to China, Iran likely <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-6700-9_32" target="_blank">views</a> AI development and technological exchanges as a top priority for its bilateral relations with China, and Chinas challenge to US dominance in AI development aligns with Tehrans goal to oppose US hegemony.</p><p>Chinas use of AI for surveillance and monitoring has very likely been the most robust area for Irans foreign AI engagement, enabling Chinese companies to expand their export of specific technologies that facilitate Iranian domestic repression. However, academic and research collaboration is very likely another key area in which Irans technology sector is benefitting from the relationship with China. In November 2024, Iranian company Bayan Rayan  the countrys only server producer  received an award at the 26th annual China Hi-Tech Fair (CHTF) 2024. In 2022, an official at Irans Islamic Azad University touted the Iran-China agreement as a golden opportunity to boost cooperation in AI and benefit from Chinese advancement in the AI field, noting that Iran had 3,000 Iranian students studying in China.</p><h4 id="russia">Russia</h4><p>The anti-West strategic alignment and commercial isolation that Iran and Russia both share, particularly as a result of Russias war with Ukraine, has <a href="https://www.cna.org/reports/2025/01/The-Evolving-Russia-Iran-Relationship.pdf" target="_blank">resulted</a> in deeper cooperation in many security-related fields. Despite the <a href="https://isis-online.org/isis-reports/mobile/iran-russia-military-technology-axis-russia-showcases-to-iran-new-and-advan" target="_blank">increased</a> <a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/iran-russia-cyber-agreement-and-us-strategy-middle-east" target="_blank">cooperation</a> in several <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-supplies-iran-with-cyber-weapons-as-military-cooperation-grows-b14b94cd" target="_blank">spheres</a>, specific details on the extent of the current Iran-Russia collaboration on AI R&amp;D are limited. In January 2025, Tehran and Moscow signed a comprehensive twenty-year strategic partnership agreement that reinforced areas of ongoing cooperation in the technical sphere, including information and communication technologies, digital development, and higher education. While the text of the agreement does not specifically mention AI, Irans Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated the agreement provides a platform for sharing knowledge and collaboration in fields such as nanotechnology, aerospace, artificial intelligence, and medical sciences and expands cooperation at the government and academic levels.</p><p>Leading up to the 2025 comprehensive agreement, a flurry of Iran-Russia cooperation documents and engagements have promoted cooperation on AI. In March 2024, the two countries signed a Memorandum of Understanding to cooperate on ethics in AI, exchanging experiences in the implementation of the ethical principles of AI. The agreement specified that the Russian Commission on Ethics in AI would provide training for Irans AI and Robotics Development headquarters. In November 2019, Russia and Iran signed a Memorandum of Understanding on cooperation to support twenty joint research plans in fifteen scientific fields, including, among others, information technology, computer systems, and AI.</p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/ta-ir-2025-0417.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Learn how Recorded Future's brand refresh, powered by AI and actionable threat intelligence, helps teams evolve with the next generation of cybersecurity.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="the-next-chapter-in-our-journey">The next chapter in our journey</h2><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/rebrand_001_77f3ccc1db.png" alt="rebrand-001.png"></p><p style="font-size:1.5rem;">Today marks an exciting milestone as we unveil Recorded Future's refreshed brand identity and website  a transformation that reflects the <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/6-threat-intelligence-outlooks-strategies-2025" target="_blank">next chapter in cybersecurity</a> and threat intelligence. This evolution arrives at a pivotal moment when organizations face increasingly sophisticated threats that demand clarity, focus, and actionable insights.</p><p>The inspiration for this refresh became clear while walking the floors at cybersecurity conferences. Amid a sea of sameness  dark displays, matrix-like code animations, and ubiquitous hooded figures  the messaging blends together in an indistinguishable haze of technical jargon and vague promises.</p><p>For security leaders tasked with protecting their organizations, this uniformity creates a real challenge: how to identify what truly matters when everyone looks and sounds the same?</p><p>This observation became the catalyst for our brand refresh  not just as a marketing initiative, but as an authentic expression of how Recorded Future helps security professionals cut through overwhelming noise to focus on what&#39;s essential.</p><h2 id="deconstructing-our-brand-heritage">Deconstructing our brand heritage.</h2><p>This journey wasn&#39;t about creating a new logo  Recorded Future already had a strong visual mark. Instead, we focused on building a comprehensive visual and verbal language that embodies clarity and precision. The deconstructed logo became an important aspect of our brand system, allowing us to create meaningful visual elements that connect our identity with the purpose that has been at the heart of our company since we were founded in 2009. </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/rebrand_002_f65ed09a0f.png" alt="rebrand-002.png"></p><p>It also became a symbol of premium offering in the category. When we created patterns using deconstructed elements of the logo, we were struck by their beauty being reminiscent of Hermes scarves (another brand that is at the pinnacle of their category).</p><p>The process involved examining countless competitor websites, which blended together in a blur of undifferentiated, fear-based messaging. The question emerged: &quot;Could our brand serve as an antidote to this confusion, bringing the same clarity to our marketing that our platform brings to threat intelligence?&quot; This approach transcended typical design exercises. It centered on authentically representing the value we provide. Our customers aren&#39;t just buying software  they&#39;re seeking confidence amid constant pressure and overwhelming data. They need a partner who understands their fundamental requirement: knowing which threats truly matter to their business.</p><h2 id="crafting-our-story-finding-our-voice">Crafting our story. Finding our voice.</h2><p>When drafting our brand narrative, the team read it aloud together to feel how the words resonated beyond how they appeared on paper. The opening lines captured our essence perfectly:</p><p><em>&quot;In cybersecurity, your greatest fear isn&#39;t the threats you see coming. It&#39;s the critical signals that get lost in the noise.&quot;</em></p><p>This became our north star, guiding the development of four pillars for our design system:</p><ul><li><strong>Meaningful</strong>  Reinforcing what we stand for and the value we deliver to customers</li><li><strong>Bold</strong>  Being distinctive, confident, and immediately recognizable in a crowded marketplace</li><li><strong>Premium</strong>  Conveying the sophistication that positions us as the market leader in intelligence</li><li><strong>Helpful</strong>  Using design to help customers discover relevant content and navigate complex information</li></ul><h2 id="visual-distinction-with-purpose">Visual distinction with purpose.</h2><p>The introduction of vibrant electric blue serves as more than an aesthetic choice  it symbolizes our promise to illuminate what matters in a noisy threat landscape. Upon seeing it, CEO Christopher Ahlberg remarked, &quot;Now that stands out,&quot; confirming we were moving in the right direction.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/rebrand_003_4a2887138b.png" alt="rebrand-003.png"></p><p>Christopher&#39;s guidance on our website proved equally valuable: &quot;The most important thing is to build a website that is truly useful and engages customers in a way that there&#39;s something they want to come back to.&quot; This perspective drove our approach toward building a destination that delivers ongoing value, with particular emphasis on elevating the incredible content and thought leadership we provide  a significant differentiator for Recorded Future in the marketplace.</p><p>The website redesign presented an interesting challenge: balancing rich content with product and sales experiences. Years of building trust through <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/2024-state-of-threat-intelligence" target="_blank">intelligence research</a> has established Recorded Future&#39;s reputation for expertise. </p><p>Elevating this content became central to our strategy.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/rebrand_004_b07e9c663f.jpg" alt="rebrand-004.jpg"></p><p>Our intelligence research demonstrates expertise, builds credibility, and provides tangible value to security professionals. The design needed to showcase this strength while making our insights more accessible and actionable.</p><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/player.js" async></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/jiut8byq3k.js" async type="module"></script><style>wistia-player[media-id='jiut8byq3k']:not(:defined) { background: center / contain no-repeat url('https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/jiut8byq3k/swatch'); display: block; filter: blur(5px); padding-top:56.25%; }</style> <wistia-player media-id="jiut8byq3k" aspect="1.7777777777777777"></wistia-player><h2 id="bringing-our-story-to-life--with-ai-and-humanity">Bringing our story to life  with AI and humanity.</h2><p>The brand launch features a powerful video that tells the story of Recorded Future&#39;s next chapter, created entirely using generative AI. This approach represents a meaningful parallel to our core work  using <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/next-evolution-recorded-future-ai-powering-threat-intelligence" target="_blank">advanced AI to combat sophisticated cyber threats</a>. Just as we harness AI to deliver precision Intelligence, we embraced AI-powered creativity to express our vision for the future of cybersecurity. </p><p>But what moves me most about this rebrand is the response from our people. Watching our teams getting excited about the new materials, hearing our intelligence analysts express how the new brand better reflects the sophistication of their work  these moments affirm that we&#39;ve created something that resonates on a human level.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/rebrand_005_c08da55943.png" alt="rebrand-005.png"></p><h2 id="the-road-ahead">The Road Ahead</h2><p>This refreshed identity helps us communicate with the same precision and clarity that our platform delivers, elevating our brand while making complex intelligence more accessible and actionable.</p><p>As cyber threats grow in complexity, our platform indexes vast sources of global data, using advanced machine learning and natural language processing to deliver timely, actionable intelligence. This empowers security teams to anticipate threats, understand adversaries&#39; tactics, and respond swiftly.</p><p>The threat landscape will continue to evolve, but our commitment remains steadfast: helping security teams know what matters most and act first. Our brand now expresses this promise in every interaction, from website visits to platform experiences.</p><p>This transformation achieves differentiation in the market while authentically embodying our core belief: in a world of overwhelming noise, precision and focus provide the ultimate protection.</p><p>As we begin this next chapter, the entire team deserves recognition for bringing this vision to life. This refresh isn&#39;t merely about visual identity  it&#39;s about helping our customers become more confident, more precise, and ultimately more secure.</p><hr><p><em>Kalpana Singh is SVP of Marketing at Recorded Future, where she leads brand strategy and marketing initiatives.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attacks have existed since the early days of the internet. While new tricks occasionally pop uplike leveraging certain vulnerabilities to amplify attacksthe core idea remains: overwhelming servers with more traffic than they can handle. Think of it as trying to push the ocean through a straw. When these attacks grow big, they can even disrupt internet providers themselves. Companies like <a href="" target="_blank">Google</a> and <a href="" target="_blank">Cloudflare</a> still battle these threats regularly, proving DDoS remains a serious issue even in 2025.</p><p>Historically, cybercriminals have targeted entire industries like airlines and banks, shutting the companies down until they paid. State-backed groups from countries like <a href="" target="_blank">Russia</a> and <a href="" target="_blank">Iran</a> also use DDoS attacks as weapons against their enemies.</p><h2 id="why-spend-money-before-an-attack-happens">Why Spend Money Before an Attack Happens?</h2><p>Protecting against DDoS attacks matters because downtime means losing money or, for critical services, even worse consequences. But if your company hasn&#39;t been hit yet, why spend money on defenses? When should you start protecting yourself?</p><p>Thats where threat intelligence comes in handy. By looking at data and comparing trends, threat intelligence helps you decide if and when investing in DDoS defenses makes sense. It provides the insights to answer these questions for DDoS and any other cyber risk that may create one or more of the <a href="" target="_blank">five risk impacts</a>.</p><h2 id="smart-data-means-smart-decisions">Smart Data Means Smart Decisions</h2><p>Good decisions need good data. Recorded Future tracks thousands of DDoS attacks every day, giving you a clear picture of whos getting hit and how often. Pulling data from the Recorded Future API gives analysts useful analytics, like IP addresses targeted by attackers.</p><p>With this data, security teams can:</p><ul><li>Spot trends and predict who might be next</li><li>Automate defenses and make faster decisions</li><li>Better manage risk, knowing exactly when and how to invest</li></ul><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/9cd3a7d8_dc4a_420b_af20_ae1fe216b00c_1132x480_2b01cef361.webp" alt="9cd3a7d8-dc4a-420b-af20-ae1fe216b00c_1132x480.webp"><em>DDoS target list courtesy of Recorded Future</em></p><h2 id="whos-being-targeted">Who&#39;s Being Targeted?</h2><p>Launching DDoS attacks isnt technically difficult. Someone with basic internet know-how can do it. But some attackers put more effort into it, building armies of infected devices known as botnets. One tool frequently used by pro-Russian hackers, called DDoSia, attacks different targets daily. By tracking whos getting hit most, businesses can better prepare their defenses.</p><p>For example, Ukraine currently faces heavy attacks due to geopolitical tensions. But finance and transportation companies in Europe are also frequent targets, suggesting broader threats.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/4f39046a_858e_4e69_83dc_0ad1f3681c3b_1600x991_b89526a771.webp" alt="4f39046a-858e-4e69-83dc-0ad1f3681c3b_1600x991.webp"><em>Ten months of DDoSia targets by industry, courtesy of Recorded Future</em></p><h2 id="thinking-bigger-than-just-your-own-network">Thinking Bigger than Just Your Own Network</h2><p>When CISOs arent considering crafting better risk management narratives for executive consumption, they are contemplating improving operational resilience. Denial of service attacks fall squarely in this category. The revolving questions dont stop with an organizations local network perimeter (if such a thing even exists anymore) but extend to partners, suppliers, and wider internet infrastructure (e.g., DNS and CDN providers).</p><p>More than ever, daily business and geopolitical events create a cascading effect of cyber impacts. DDoS is always a possibility. Recent <a href="" target="_blank">attacks against X</a> (Twitters hip rebrand) are a good reminder.</p><h2 id="key-decisions-for-stronger-ddos-defense">Key Decisions for Stronger DDoS Defense</h2><p>The decisions that underpin DDoS defense and response correspond to organizational size, mission, footprint, regulatory compliance mandates, and resources. Here are some practical actions to consider:</p><ul><li>Partnering with your internet provider for fast response</li><li>Using scrubbing centers to filter attack traffic</li><li>Implementing challenge-response tests like CAPTCHAs</li><li>Deploying cloud protections like AWS Shield</li><li>Utilizing web application firewalls (WAF)</li><li>Optimizing network setups (like load balancers and distributed data centers)</li><li>Filtering traffic using firewalls and intrusion systems</li><li>Relying on content delivery networks (CDNs)</li><li>Using Anycast routing to protect DNS services</li></ul><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/51a7bcf4_e610_4a16_afd3_cdd56703060c_1024x1024_aca0202dc0.webp" alt="51a7bcf4-e610-4a16-afd3-cdd56703060c_1024x1024.webp"><em>Analytic contemplation courtesy of Gemini</em></p><h2 id="everyones-a-target">Everyones a Target</h2><p>Its tempting to think your business won&#39;t face a DDoS attack, especially if it&#39;s small or non-political. The reality? Anyone online can become a target for extortion or political agendas. That&#39;s why proactive intelligence is so valuableit helps security teams know when threats are getting closer and when its time to upgrade defenses.</p><p>As the frequency of DDoS attacks increases around certain industries or regions, it&#39;s essential to reassess and strengthen your own security controls accordingly. The closer these threats get, the more your organization should test their resilience. Said differently, as DDoS attack proximity moves closer to an organization, the operational disruption risk may, in parallel, need to <a href="" target="_blank">move north on the resilience axis</a>.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/e749bad6_f210_4917_a230_a144e9e72ae7_1600x900_ff2063ce4a.webp" alt="e749bad6-f210-4917-a230-a144e9e72ae7_1600x900.webp"><em>Risk Graph courtesy of ChatGPT</em></p><h2 id="staying-one-step-ahead">Staying One Step Ahead</h2><p>DDoS attacks aren&#39;t going away, but they don&#39;t have to be a nightmare, either. Threat intelligence provides the clear insights needed to prepare and respond effectively. By using analytics wisely, organizations can invest smartly, build stronger defenses, and keep their operations running smoothly. When attacks creep closersay, spiking in your sector or geographysecond-order risks (like operational disruption) loom larger. Thats your cue to prioritize resilience, whether a CDN subscription or ISP speed-dial.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="the-global-fraud-landscape">The Global Fraud Landscape</h2><p>Fraud is a booming industry, with scammers <a href="https://www.gasa.org/_files/ugd/7bdaac_9060be8317424edd9964072cf279a0a4.pdf" target="_blank">pulling in</a> over <strong>$1 trillion</strong> from their victims in 2024. Businesses are paying the price: <strong>87%</strong> of businesses <a href="https://www.veriff.com/ebooks/us-industry-pulse-survey-2024" target="_blank">reported</a> an increase in online fraud, with most experiencing a <strong>1% to 9%</strong> loss in revenue as a result. In terms of individual consumers, Asia reported digital scam losses <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/ap/en/perspectives/en/2025/evolution-of-fraud-and-scams-in-asia-the-need-for-a-unified-defence/" target="_blank">reaching</a> <strong>$700 billion</strong> last year, compared to the <strong>$12.5 billion</strong> reported by US consumers in <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/03/new-ftc-data-show-big-jump-reported-losses-fraud-125-billion-2024" target="_blank">2024</a>. </p><p>Trust-based financial exploitation scams are especially lucrative. Examples include <a href="https://www.scamwatch.gov.au/stay-protected/real-life-stories/dating-and-romance-scam-georginas-facebook-fianc%C3%A9-leaves-her-flat-broke" target="_blank">romance</a> scams, investment scams, or <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-24/fake-chinese-authority-scam-extorting-millions/104974122" target="_blank">impersonation</a> scams. Fraudulent actors can adapt impersonation scams to target businesses, such as by posing as regulators or <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/04/asia/deepfake-cfo-scam-hong-kong-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank">impersonating</a> executives. The percentage of people who reported losing money to fraud and scams <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/03/new-ftc-data-show-big-jump-reported-losses-fraud-125-billion-2024" target="_blank">increased</a> from 27% in 2023 to 38% in 2024, suggesting that scams are increasingly more effective and believable. </p><h2 id="huione-marketplace-the-one-stop-shop-for-fraud">Huione Marketplace: The One-Stop Shop for Fraud</h2><p>Online platforms that market tools and services to Chinese-speaking cybercriminals are one factor behind this boom, making it easier for criminals to execute fraud at scale. <a href="https://support.recordedfuture.com/hc/en-us/articles/37986893239187-Huione-Guarantee-Serves-as-a-One-Stop-Shop-for-Chinese-Speaking-Cybercriminals" target="_blank">Huione Guarantee</a>, a prominent gray-market hub that operates under the Huione Group, a Cambodian financial conglomerate, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-largest-illicit-online-marketplace-ever-is-growing-at-an-alarming-rate" target="_blank">acts</a> as a one-stop shop for fraud-related tools and services. The website compiles Telegram channels with posts offering cryptocurrency mining tools, money laundering, and <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/10m-lost-in-malware-scam-where-victims-banking-credentials-stolen-by-keylogger-hidden-in-app" target="_blank">malware-as-a-service</a>. The channels also promote offerings that use social engineering to facilitate fraud, including the sale of social media accounts to adopt realistic online personas, as well as personal, financial, and employment data to personalize the scam. Sellers also advertise generative AI deepfake voice and face-changing tools, some of which list <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/17/us-bans-export-of-more-ai-chips-including-nvidia-h800-to-china.html" target="_blank">US-sanctioned</a> computer hardware components in the technology specifications. Advanced consumer-grade GPUs, like the kind recommended by threat actors for an advanced face swapping tool sold on the Huione Marketplace, are widely <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/the-underground-network-sneaking-nvidia-chips-into-china-f733aaa6" target="_blank">available</a> through underground and informal distribution networks.</p><h2 id="from-scams-to-slavery-tcos-ai-tools-and-human-trafficking">From Scams to Slavery: TCOs, AI Tools, and Human Trafficking</h2><p>Transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) use services from Huione Guarantee to support large-scale scam operations. These organizations operate call center compounds in Cambodia and Myanmar that force <a href="https://www.humanity-consultancy.com/publications/responses-to-trafficking-in-persons-for-forced-criminality-in-the-thai-context" target="_blank">human trafficking victims</a> to carry out hundreds of scam calls each day.

However, political instability and weak governance in regions where these centers operate make sustained enforcement efforts challenging. </p><p>Huione infrastructure also supports money laundering services through Huoine Pay, the conglomerates banking arm. The Huione Pay website advertises money laundering services along with other scam tools. The National Bank of Cambodia recently <a href="https://www.rfa.org/english/cambodia/2025/03/06/huione-cambodia-cyberscam-cryptocurrency/" target="_blank">stripped</a> Huoine Pays banking license in response to international pressure, though further enforcement actions such as arrests or fines have not yet been made. </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/huoine_00d82a28ea.png" alt="huoine.png"><em>Huione infrastructure (Huione Guarantee and Huione Pay) help to expand scam operations conducted by Chinese criminals (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><h2 id="new-markets-expanding-to-the-us-and-beyond">New Markets: Expanding to the US and Beyond</h2><p>TCOs are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240612094033/https://www.usip.org/programs/transnational-organized-crime-southeast-asia" target="_blank">beginning</a> to look to other regions to grow their operations.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In today&#39;s unpredictable threat landscape, cybersecurity isn&#39;t just an IT concernit&#39;s a critical business initiative with direct impact on your organization&#39;s bottom line and brand reputation. As threat actors grow increasingly sophisticated, security leaders face mounting pressure to demonstrate the tangible value of their cybersecurity investments.</p><h2 id="the-financial-and-business-impact-of-cyber-risks">The Financial and Business Impact of Cyber Risks</h2><p>Cyber threats pose far more than just technical challengesthey carry significant financial and operational consequences that can affect an organization&#39;s bottom line, stakeholder confidence, and long-term sustainability. Recent research quantifies that impact: the average <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach" target="_blank">cost of a data breach</a> now stands at $4.88 million, and the aftermath of cybersecurity incidents often extends well beyond the immediate financial losses.</p><p>For businesses, the equation is simple yet profound: effective <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/supercharge-risk-reduction" target="_blank">cybersecurity risk reduction</a> directly translates to business value. By implementing proactive threat intelligence and comprehensive security measures, organizations can:</p><ul><li>Prevent revenue losses from operational disruptions</li><li>Avoid costly fraud and impersonation schemes</li><li>Strengthen customer trust and brand reputation</li><li>Reduce cyber insurance premiums</li><li>Minimize recovery costs from security incidents</li></ul><h2 id="the-cost-of-cyber-risks-to-businesses">The Cost of Cyber Risks to Businesses</h2><p>According to new research conducted with hundreds of Recorded Future customers, organizations are seeing substantial ROI from their threat intelligence investments in areas that extend far beyond traditional security metrics. The data, compiled in Recorded Future&#39;s comprehensive 2025 ROI Report, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/report/how-recorded-future-drives-roi" target="_blank">How Recorded Future Drives ROI for Cybersecurity Teams,</a> reveals how mature threat intelligence programs translate directly to business resilience and financial benefits.</p><h3 id="brand-reputation-impact">Brand Reputation Impact</h3><p>When a company falls victim to a cyber attack, the damage to brand reputation can be substantial and long-lasting.

Swift typosquat mitigation not only helps combat phishing attempts, but it also enables your customers to seamlessly carry out the actions they set out to accomplish by visiting your site. We see that as an increase in web traffic that we can quantify the value of with the help of research by the <a href="https://www.cs.uic.edu/~ckanich/papers/khan2015every.pdf" target="_blank">University of Illinois</a>. </p><p>An average billion-dollar business sees 2 million monthly web visits. At an average loss rate of 5.28% due to typosquatting according to research from <a href="https://www.cs.uic.edu/~ckanich/papers/khan2015every.pdf" target="_blank">University of Illinois</a>, more efficient typosquat takedowns with Recorded Future would help them recover over 50,000 website visits each month  and an expected $2,602 monthly value.</p><p>&quot;We have improved brand protection by at least 100%. We can identify risks and patterns in infancy stages, and we&#39;ve automated brand scanning to eliminate hours of manual work. As we automate more coverage, we have saved hundreds of labor hours per quarter and improved efficiency,&quot; reports <a href="https://app.userevidence.com/assets/8091GFKY" target="_blank">Joe Azzouggagh, Manager of Trust and Safety at ruby</a>.</p><h3 id="cyber-insurance-considerations">Cyber Insurance Considerations</h3><p>As cyber attacks have become more prevalent, cyber insurance has evolved from a nice-to-have to a business necessity. However, premiums can be substantial, particularly for organizations that face significant risk.</p><p>Based on observable market data and the average 2024 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach" target="_blank">cost of a breach</a> being $4.88 million, a typical billion-dollar company likely pays a yearly premium of $207,400, or $35-50,000 per million of coverage.</p><p>Recorded Future customers report average monthly premium savings of $2,497approximately $30,000 annually. One customer, <a href="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/channel/06bopitbe1?wchannelid=06bopitbe1&wmediaid=1j7x7zezcc" target="_blank">Cummins</a>, achieved an impressive 32% year-over-year reduction in cyber insurance premiums after implementing Recorded Future&#39;s threat intelligence platform.</p><h3 id="operational-disruption-and-downtime">Operational Disruption and Downtime</h3><p>Service disruptions resulting from cyber incidents carry dual consequences: immediate revenue losses and lasting reputational damage. <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/reducing-operational-risk-with-threat-intelligence" target="_blank">Reducing operational risk</a> has become a priority for organizations of all sizes. When systems go offline due to ransomware or distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, every minute of downtime translates to financial impact.</p><p>Our customers report that threat intelligence from Recorded Future helps minimize downtime, which for a billion-dollar organization translates to an average revenue value of approximately $19,025 per monthor nearly $230,000 annually. This calculation doesn&#39;t even account for the additional benefit of avoiding reputational damage that inevitably accompanies service disruptions.</p><p>Recorded Future allows us to shift our mindset from being more reactive in nature to being more proactive and responsive to threats that went unnoticed in the past. This, in turn, has facilitated the development of new processes that have enhanced the overall security posture of the business,&quot; explains a <a href="https://app.userevidence.com/assets/2791JWBD" target="_blank">Lead Cyber Defense Engineer at a major food and staples retailing company</a>.</p><h3 id="fraud-prevention">Fraud Prevention</h3><p>Payment fraud, transaction fraud, and billing schemes represent significant financial threats to businesses across industries. Through comprehensive threat intelligence, organizations can identify and mitigate these risks before they materialize into actual losses.</p><p>Recorded Futures threat intelligence helps customers reduce fraud losses. A billion-dollar business that loses $500,000 annually to payment fraud losses would recover over $6,812 per month through improved threat intelligence with Recorded Future. Outside of the payments themselves, fraud loss mitigation also contributes financially by strengthening the integrity and trustworthiness of your business.</p><p>As one customer, a <a href="http://uevi.co/4047UHKE" target="_blank">Senior Information Security Analyst at Jefferson Bank</a>, noted: &quot;We use Recorded Future&#39;s dark web intelligence to proactively stop attacks, reset weak passwords, or prevent bank card fraud. This has a potential savings of $1,000-2,000 depending on the customer or situation.&quot;</p><h3 id="all-together-the-roi-of-business-and-brand-risk-reduction-with-recorded-future">All Together: The ROI of Business and Brand Risk Reduction with Recorded Future</h3><p>Across all risk reduction areas, customers can save approximately $31,000 monthlyor $371,000 yearly.</p><p>This substantial return breaks down into several key components:</p><ul><li>$2,602 monthly from brand reputation protection</li><li>$2,497 monthly from reduced cyber insurance premiums</li><li>$19,025 monthly from downtime avoidance/increased uptime</li><li>$6,812 monthly from fraud loss prevention</li></ul><p>Together, these savings represent a 209.4% ROI on business risk reduction alone.

            <description><![CDATA[Learn about CVE-2025-24813 affecting Apache Tomcat products. Patch now to prevent remote code execution. ]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="what-is-cve-2025-24813">What is CVE-2025-24813?</h2><p><a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/vulnerability-database/CVE-2025-24813">CVE-2025-24813</a> is a critical path equivalence vulnerability in Apache Tomcat, with exploitation attempts by threat actors observed in the wild. The vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable servers without authentication under specific conditions, potentially leading to system compromise and sensitive data being exposed. </p><p>Organizations affected by the configuration required for exploitation should patch CVE-2025-24813 to mitigate potential attacks and protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.</p><p>The vulnerability affects Tomcat versions 11.0.0-M1 to 11.0.2, 10.1.0-M1 to 10.1.34, and 9.0.0. M1 to 9.0.98. <strong>Additionally, Insikt Groups analysis found that 8.5.x versions (specifically 8.5.0 to 8.5.98 and 8.5.100, with the exception of 8.5.99) are also vulnerable, though they were not included in the initial set of affected products by Apache.</strong></p><h2 id="insikt-groups-assessment-of-cve-2025-24813">Insikt Groups Assessment of CVE-2025-24813</h2><p>CVE-2025-24813 stems from Tomcats handling of partial PUT requests and allows remote, unauthenticated attackers to conduct remote code execution (RCE), view security-sensitive files, and inject content into those files. </p><p>Exploitation involves two primary steps: </p><ul><li>The attacker sends a PUT request containing a Base64-encoded serialized Java payload to the server. This payload is designed to trigger RCE upon deserialization.</li><li>The attacker then sends a GET request with a specially crafted JSESSIONID cookie referencing the malicious session, causing the server to deserialize the payload and execute arbitrary code.</li></ul><p>However, successfully conducting RCE requires the following conditions: </p><ul><li>The default servlet must have write permissions enabled (disabled by default) </li><li>Partial PUT support must be enabled (enabled by default) </li><li>The application uses Tomcat&#39;s file-based session persistence with the default storage location </li><li>The application includes a library that can be leveraged in a deserialization attack</li></ul><p>If the following conditions are true, attackers can view sensitive security files and inject content into those files: </p><ul><li>The default servlet must have write permissions enabled (disabled by default)  </li><li>Partial PUT support must be enabled (enabled by default) </li><li>The target URL for sensitive uploads resides within a sub-directory of the public uploads directory </li><li>The attacker is aware of the filenames of the security-sensitive files being uploaded </li><li>The security-sensitive files are uploaded using partial PUT requests</li></ul><p>As such, only a limited number of Tomcat instances are likely to be affected by the configuration required for exploitation. For example, a GitHub code search query to check for the write permissions condition (<code>&lt;param-name&gt;readonly&lt; /param-name&gt; AND &quot;false&quot; language:xml</code>) shows only 218 open-source projects using this configuration.</p><p>Cybersecurity firm Greynoise has identified six malicious IP addresses attempting to exploit CVE-2025-24813, targeting systems in the US, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and Australia. However, Insikt Group has not identified any evidence of successful exploitation or any evidence of known threat actors exploiting the vulnerability. At the time of writing, there were 378,444 exposed instances on Shodan.

            <description><![CDATA[Discover how Recorded Future improves cybersecurity team productivity, saving 100+ hours weekly and driving $290K in annual ROI through threat intelligence.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cybersecurity teams face a constant onslaught of critical and potentially catastrophic challenges: from defending against sophisticated ransomware attacks to preventing coordinated nation-state campaigns. To make their challenges worse, teams often struggle with a lack of visibility, alert fatigue, limited resources and manual processes.</p><p>Threat intelligence has emerged as a critical solution to these challenges, providing the context and actionable insights needed to prioritize effectively and respond proactively. Rather than adding to the noise, threat intelligence cuts through it, enabling security teams to work more efficiently, focusing on what matters and responding to it quickly. </p><p>To understand how customers of Recorded Future leverage threat intelligence to act more efficiently, we partnered with third-party research firm <a href="https://app.userevidence.com/user-research-library/recorded-future?per_page=25&page=1&sort_by=updated_at&sort_dir=desc&responded=1&view=card" target="_blank">UserEvidence</a> to collect quantitative ROI data and qualitative feedback to create our newly published report: <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/report/how-recorded-future-drives-roi" target="_blank"><strong>How Recorded Future Drives ROI for Cybersecurity Teams</strong></a>. </p><p>The report reveals that by automating manual workflows, streamlining investigations, and enabling teams to focus on what matters most, Recorded Future customers are reporting time savings of over 100 hours per weektranslating to approximately $290,237 in annual productivity gains for the average organization. In this blog post, we explore the reports findings and what our customers have to say about improving efficiency. </p><h2 id="the-growing-need-for-cybersecurity-efficiency">The Growing Need for Cybersecurity Efficiency</h2><p>Security teams across industries are feeling the strain of increasing responsibilities with limited resources. This imbalance often results in:</p><ul><li>Burnout among team members tasked with manual, repetitive processes</li><li>Operational inefficiencies that slow response times</li><li>Difficulty prioritizing among a constant stream of alerts</li><li>Challenges in demonstrating value to organizational leadership</li></ul><p>These challenges create a significant productivity gap that affects not just the security team, but the entire organization&#39;s resilience against cyber threats.</p><p>&quot;Threat intelligence will always improve your visibility. The important part is to do it without overburdening your team. How can we add new threat intelligence use cases without creating a whole load of extra work and alerts to deal with?&quot; explains Jason Steer, CISO at Recorded Future.</p><h2 id="measuring-the-roi-of-recorded-futures-efficiency-gains">Measuring the ROI of Recorded Future&#39;s Efficiency Gains</h2><p>Recent research conducted by UserEvidence paints a compelling picture of how Recorded Future transforms security operations. In a comprehensive survey of security professionals using the platform, the data revealed remarkable efficiency gains realized by teams, for example:</p><ul><li><strong>Teams save an average of 11 hours weekly</strong> on alert triage, investigation, and response</li><li><strong>Threat analysis, hunting, and reporting time reduced by 11 hours weekly</strong></li><li><strong>Brand abuse mitigation efforts streamlined by 8 hours per week</strong></li><li><strong>Spending 7 hours less per week on vendor and supplier evaluation processes</strong></li></ul><p>When translated to financial impact, these productivity improvements add up to approximately <strong>$290,237 in annual savings</strong> for the average organization implementing Recorded Future. Later in this article, well break down the full picture.</p><p>As one <a href="https://app.userevidence.com/assets/4669MYFV" target="_blank">Senior SOC analyst and Threat Intelligence Analyst</a> at an Air Freight &amp; Logistics company reported: &quot;We automated 70% of manual workflows with Recorded Future, cutting investigation times by 50%. This led to a 40% increase in threat detection efficiency and a 30% reduction in response times, enhancing our overall security posture.&quot;</p><p><a href="http://uevi.co/2879KFMW" target="_blank">Valentin Vanlaeys, Threat Intelligence Lead</a> at Proximus Ada, shared similar results: &quot;Thanks to Recorded Future&#39;s valuable and actionable data, we cut our intelligence hunting, reporting, and analysis by 80%.&quot;</p><h2 id="how-recorded-future-transforms-security-operations">How Recorded Future Transforms Security Operations</h2><h3 id="common-challenges-security-teams-face-in-productivity">Common Challenges Security Teams Face in Productivity</h3><h4 id="before-manual-processes-amidst-high-urgency">Before: Manual Processes Amidst High Urgency</h4><p>Without Recorded Future&#39;s automated intelligence capabilities, security teams shoulder the burden of time-consuming manual workflows that may look something like this:</p><ol><li>Finding relevant data sources across open-source intelligence feeds, blogs, news outlets, social media, and forums</li><li>Collecting unstructured and complex data from these sources</li><li>Sifting through the data to separate signal from noise</li><li>Analyzing the information to identify potential threats</li><li>Compiling and distributing reports</li></ol><p>These processes  along with manual alert triage, investigation, and response  arent just frustratingly manual for team members. They also delay or slow down organizations response times. </p><p>Security teams are inundated with alerts, some of which are noise and some of which are relevant and urgent. If they dont have actionable threat intelligence, they cant efficiently gain an understanding of the priority or criticality of each. And when it comes to addressing a security threat, time is of the essence. </p><h4 id="after-actionable-intelligence-and-automation-with-recorded-future">After: Actionable Intelligence and Automation with Recorded Future</h4><p>Recorded Future helps teams efficiently capture, compile, and analyze threat data, turning it into actionable intelligence that teams would otherwise need to triage, investigate, and respond to manually. This frees the security team to focus their energy on responding to high-priority threats and hunting new ones. Rather than struggling to address everything that seems important, they can think strategically about protecting their organization. </p><p>With the Recorded Future Intelligence Platform, teams can shift from reactive to proactive security postures:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/from-speed-to-consistency-power-automation-for-your-soc" target="_blank"><strong>Intelligence-driven automation across security workflows</strong></a> accelerates identification, investigation, and prioritization of threats</li><li><strong>Streamlined workflows</strong> reduce investigation time by providing immediate context</li><li><strong>Resource optimization</strong> allows skilled analysts to focus on strategic initiatives rather than routine tasks</li></ul><p>As one <a href="https://app.userevidence.com/assets/7691ENSY" target="_blank">Information Security Specialist</a> at an Industrial Conglomerates Company noted: &quot;We use Recorded Future&#39;s risk lists to block malicious IPs with a risk score of 65 or higher. As a result, we automatically make an average of approximately 5 million blocks per day, resulting in a time savings of about 40 hours per month for our team.&quot;</p><p><a href="https://app.userevidence.com/assets/7193MCHB" target="_blank">Jack Edens, IT Security Analyst</a> at Dupaco Credit Union, adds: &quot;Recorded Future was a game-changer for us, transforming how our team managed threats and stayed proactive. With their platform, we automated repetitive reporting tasks, which allowed us to move key resources onto critical issues, tightening our focus on real threats. This shift didn&#39;t just streamline our workflows; it gave us back nearly 50% in efficiency  significant when you&#39;re dealing with a constant flow of new data.&quot;</p><h2 id="real-world-productivity-improvements-by-the-numbers">Real-World Productivity Improvements: By the Numbers</h2><h3 id="how-threat-intelligence-increases-productivity-and-efficiency">How Threat Intelligence Increases Productivity and Efficiency</h3><p>Recorded Future customers achieve a more proactive, productive, and mature threat intelligence program, saving hundreds of thousands of dollars in productivity along the way. </p><p>Here are the activities where they save time and money and improve their processes:</p>  <table>    <tr><td><strong>Activity/Area</strong></td><td><strong>Weekly Time Savings</strong></td></tr>    <tr><td>Alert triage, investigation, & response</td><td>11 hrs</td></tr>    <tr><td>Threat analysis, hunting, & reporting</td><td>11 hrs</td></tr>    <tr><td>Brand abuse mitigation</td><td>8 hrs</td></tr>    <tr><td>Vendor evaluation</td><td>7 hrs</td></tr>    <tr><td>Digital footprint analysis</td><td>8 hrs</td></tr>    <tr><td>Threat landscape analysis</td><td>10 hrs</td></tr>    <tr><td>Senior analyst efficiency</td><td>50 hrs</td></tr>  </table><br><p>Perhaps most significant is the impact on senior analyst efficiency.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt group logo"></p><h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2><p>In 2024, Insikt Group significantly expanded its tracking of malicious infrastructure by covering more malware families and categories, additional infrastructure types such as staging servers, and integrating data sources like Recorded Future Network Intelligence, enhancing threat detection, higher-tier infrastructure insights, and victimology analysis. While many key 2023 trends persisted  such as Cobalt Strike dominating offensive security tools (OSTs), AsyncRAT and QuasarRAT leading among remote access trojans (RATs), China and the United States (US) being the top hosting locations, and law enforcement actions having often only temporary impact  Insikt Group identified several emerging trends in 2024.</p><p>Notably, malware-as-a-service (MaaS) infostealers, led by LummaC2, grew in prevalence, likely driven by law enforcement actions against competitor infostealers and rapid innovation by LummaC2. Additionally, Android remained the primary target for mobile malware, with Hook leading. While Latrodectus dominated droppers and loaders despite law enforcement disruptions in the loader ecosystem, traffic distribution systems (TDSs) continued to enhance cybercrime efficiency, as seen with TAG-124, and the abuse of content delivery networks (CDNs) like Cloudflare surged. In regards to state-sponsored groups, China notably increased its use of relay networks such as ArcSilt, while Russia continued its abuse of a wide range of <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/threat-actors-leverage-internet-services-to-enhance-data-theft-and-weaken-security-defenses" target="_blank">legitimate internet services (LIS)</a>.</p><p>Defenders should leverage this report&#39;s insights to strengthen security controls by prioritizing top malware and infrastructure techniques, and thereby enhance network monitoring and deploy relevant detections like YARA, Sigma, and Snort. This should be complemented by investments in tracking evolving malicious infrastructure dynamics, conducting threat simulations to test defenses, and effectively monitoring the broader threat landscape. Regarding LIS, defenders must balance blocking, flagging, or allowing high-risk services based on their assessed criticality and risk level.</p><p>As malicious infrastructure evolves and detection improves, Insikt Group expects existing trends to persist in 2025, driven by continuous threat actor innovation rather than drastic shifts. For example, the &quot;as-a-service&quot; ecosystem will likely expand, and threat actors will increasingly rely on legitimate tools, services, and CDNs to evade detection. Furthermore, with growing mobile reliance, Insikt Group expects mobile-based threats to continue to rise. Relay networks, primarily used by Chinese state-sponsored groups up until now, may see broader adoption by cybercriminals and other state-sponsored groups. Lastly, law enforcement actions are expected to have a greater impact due to enhanced international cooperation and accrued expertise in large-scale cybercrime takedowns.</p><h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2><ul><li>MaaS infostealers led in infections in 2024, with LummaC2 dominating command-and-control (C2) servers as continuous innovation and law enforcement actions against rivals like RedLine Stealer reshaped the cybercrime ecosystem.</li><li>AsyncRAT and Quasar RAT remained the top remote access tools (RATs), while MaaS-based malware like DcRAT continued widespread use.</li><li>The US (North America), Brazil (South America), Angola (Africa), France (Europe), India (Asia), and Australia (Oceania) recorded the highest number of victims in their respective regions based on Recorded Future Network Intelligence, with AsyncRAT emerging as the most prevalent malware in most cases. Other significant threats included QuasarRAT and Cobalt Strike.</li><li>Android remained the primary target for mobile malware, with nine of the top ten families focusing on it, alongside the rise of mercenary spyware and potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) like stalkerware.</li><li>Cobalt Strike accounted for two-thirds of offensive security tool command-and-control (C2) servers, with jQuery as the most popular malleable profile and cs2modrewrite targeting the most victim countries. Cobalt Strike is followed by Metasploit, with detections of Sliver and Brute Ratel C4 rising significantly.</li><li>Mozi Botnet was the largest tracked botnet in 2024 based on the number of identified bots, while older botnets remained active, being primarily used for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, as well as credential theft and localized attacks, as seen with Fenix Botnet.</li><li>Latrodectus dominated all droppers and loaders in 2024, accounting for 33% of detections, likely driven by law enforcement disruptions in the loader ecosystem, while most top families emerged post-2021, indicating shorter lifespans.</li><li>TDS continued to play a crucial role in cybercrime by improving efficiency, targeting, and profitability while evading detection, exemplified by TAG-124, which served a broad user base, including ransomware groups like Rhysida.</li><li>The US and China dominated malicious hosting, while bulletproof hosting providers like Stark Industries played a growing role in cybercrime infrastructure.</li><li>Chinese state-sponsored groups expanded their use of anonymization networks in 2024 to target entities worldwide, enabling them to blend with legitimate traffic and complicate victim identification, while RedDelta used Cloudflare to proxy C2 traffic and geo-fence malicious files.</li><li>Russian state-sponsored groups increasingly relied on legitimate services like Ngrok, Cloudflare, and Telegram to evade detection, with BlueDelta shifting to Ngrok after takedown efforts and BlueAlpha using Cloudflare Tunnels to stage GammaDrop malware.</li></ul><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>Insikt Group proactively identifies and monitors infrastructure associated with hundreds of malware families, threat actors, and other artifacts, including phishing kits, scanners, and relay networks. By automatically validating malicious infrastructure through various proprietary methods on a daily basis, Insikt Group provides accurate risk representation, enabling Recorded Future customers to enhance their detection and defense capabilities.</p><p>Building on Insikt Group&#39;s annual adversary infrastructure reports from <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/2022-adversary-infrastructure-report" target="_blank">2022</a> and <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2024-1209.pdf" target="_blank">2023</a>, the 2024 Malicious Infrastructure Report provides a concise, data-based overview of malicious infrastructure observed throughout 2024. This year, it specifically emphasizes the synergy among passive infrastructure detection, higher-tier infrastructure insights powered by Recorded Future Network Intelligence, and victim identification. Overall, this report is for anyone interested in malicious infrastructure, offering a high-level overview of its current state as well as summaries of key findings to inform decision-making and provide a broad perspective in this highly dynamic environment.</p><p>Recognizing the challenge of categorizing malware types in a mutually exclusive manner due to their overlapping functionalities, this report establishes a set of malware categories to facilitate analysis, as detailed in <strong>Appendix A</strong>, with brief definitions for each. Notably, certain malware categories, such as crypters, have been intentionally excluded due to the usual absence of network artifacts.</p><p>Beyond examining malicious infrastructure through the lens of malware categories, Insikt Group also monitors it by type, with each type assigned a distinct risk scoring within the Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud. This differentiation reflects varying levels of severity  for instance, network traffic to or from a C2 server in a corporate network may indicate higher risk compared to a management panel, as it typically implies active malicious activity. The infrastructure types defined by Insikt Group are detailed in <strong>Appendix B</strong>.</p><h2 id="2024-malicious-infrastructure-insights-by-the-numbers">2024 Malicious Infrastructure Insights by the Numbers</h2><p>Proactively identifying malicious infrastructure is a complex task shaped by various factors. In addition to the vast volume of data, each malware family, version, or infrastructure linked to specific threat actors often employs entirely unique setups. Detection becomes even more challenging due to factors such as hosting behind CDNs like Cloudflare, the use of high or random ports, reliance on <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/threat-actors-leverage-internet-services-to-enhance-data-theft-and-weaken-security-defenses" target="_blank">legitimate internet services</a> such as Discord or Telegram, or the exploitation of compromised infrastructure.</p><p>These setups also evolve continuously, demanding that Insikt Group constantly innovate and refine its tracking methodologies. Considering all these factors, this report examines malicious infrastructure across multiple categories, including infostealers, backdoors and RATs, mobile malware, OSTs, botnets, droppers and loaders, phishing kits, web shells, and ransomware.</p><p>Overall, in 2024, there has been a significant rise in identified malicious infrastructure, driven by an evolving threat landscape and advancements in detection methodologies by Insikt Group. For instance, the number of unique, validated C2 servers doubled from 2023 to 2024, while unique, validated management panels saw a 69% increase over the same period.</p><p>In addition, using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified victims in approximately 200 countries worldwide in 2024 based on victim IP address geolocation. Countries in <strong>Figure 1</strong> were categorized into five groups based on the number of unique victims detected, with those showing high exposure being geographically dispersed worldwide. Notably, accurately measuring malware impact across countries is challenging due to variations in population size, digital footprint, analytical biases (for example, the types of malware tracked), internet infrastructure (such as proxies), and the geographical hosting choices of victim organizations.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/Fig_1_86418b387b.png" alt="Malware impact by country"><em><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Malware impact by country based on Recorded Future Network Intelligence (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><p><strong>Figure 2</strong> shows the distribution of victims by country across different continents. In North America, the US is the most targeted country, accounting for around 87% of unique victims in the region despite making up only about half of its population. The high victim count in the US is likely driven by factors such as its large population, extensive digital footprint, widespread English use (exploited in phishing campaigns), and economics, while also being influenced by the country&#39;s role as a global infrastructure hub, providing hosting and digital services to organizations worldwide. Most victims are linked to AsyncRAT, followed by SolarMarker RAT and QuasarRAT (see <strong>Table 1</strong>). Notably, unlike AsyncRAT and QuasarRAT, SolarMarker RAT is <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/exploring-the-depths-of-solarmarkers-multi-tiered-infrastructure" target="_blank">believed</a> to be operated by a single threat actor and has previously been observed predominantly targeting the US.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/Fig_2_529f459d62.png" alt="victim by country"><em><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Shares of unique victim by country and continent (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><p>In South America, Brazil recorded the highest number of unique victims, accounting for 86% of the regions total, while also only making up around half of the continents population. Previously <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/angelicamarideoliveira/2023/09/27/brazil-is-the-worlds-second-most-vulnerable-country-to-cyberattacks/" target="_blank">identified</a> as one of the countries most vulnerable to cyberattacks, Brazil has long been a hotspot for both global and local cyber threats, <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2024-04-10-world-first-cybercrime-index-ranks-countries-cybercrime-threat-level" target="_blank">ranking</a> high in cybercrime activity, with groups like Grandoreiro operating almost exclusively within its borders. In 2024, QuasarRAT infections were the most prevalent among Brazilian victims, followed by infections linked to AsyncRAT and SectopRAT.</p><p>In Africa, Angola recorded the highest number of unique victims, followed by Ghana, South Africa, the Republic of the Congo, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Notably, in two of the five most targeted African countries, PlugX, a malware linked to multiple Chinese state-sponsored groups, ranked among the most prevalent malware.</p><p>In Europe, France had the highest number of unique victims, followed by Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Poland. AsyncRAT was the most prevalent malware across all five countries, with Cobalt Strike ranking second in three of them. The distribution of victims in these top five countries closely aligns with their population sizes. Notably, in the Netherlands, GobRAT  a backdoor targeting Linux routers with malware written in Go  ranked among the top three malware families.</p><p>In Asia, India recorded the highest number of unique victims, followed by China, Indonesia, Thailand, and Hong Kong. Approximately 73% of all victims in these countries were linked to AsyncRAT, QuasarRAT, and Cobalt Strike infections. Notably, Brute Ratel C4 ranked among the top three malware in Hong Kong, highlighting its growing significance.</p><p>In Oceania, Australia accounted for 87% of all unique victims despite making up only 60% of the region&#39;s population. AsyncRAT was the most prevalent malware, linked to over half of Australia&#39;s victims, while in New Zealand, 67% of victims were associated with AsyncRAT infections.</p><p><strong>Table 1</strong> presents the full list of the top three malware families for each of the five leading countries in each continent, based on the number of unique victims observed by Insikt Group in those countries.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Modern attack surfaces extend across every place your business operates, from your first-party technology assets to your third-party network of suppliers and vendors. To spot risks before attackers do, you need to maintain continuous visibility across this expanding landscape. Employee credentials can become compromised, unknown or vulnerable internet assets can be exploited, and supply chain partners with spotty security hygiene can provide adversaries with easy access to your network and data. </p><p>At Recorded Future, weve seen firsthand how practitioners are transforming their security programs by adopting proactive strategies to protect their first- and third-party attack surfaces. </p><p>In our experience, security teams that successfully defend against these threats share a common approach: They combine comprehensive visibility with contextual intelligence.  </p><p>By understanding not just the risks that exist, but why those risks matter to the organization, these security teams enable rapid, informed decision-making that strengthens their security posture.</p><p>In this blog post, well explore how a few select customers are taking an intelligence-led approach to reducing attack surface risks. Youll discover how:</p><ul><li>Toyota Motor North America <strong>quickly remediates compromised employee credentials</strong> to prevent unauthorized access.</li><li>Cummins <strong>identifies and secures internet-facing assets</strong> to reduce their vulnerable attack surface.</li><li>Novavax <strong>takes an intelligence-driven approach to vendor risk management</strong> for greater supply chain resilience.</li><li>INVESTBANK <strong>maintains continuous awareness of vulnerabilities</strong> alongside new updates and releases.</li></ul><p>See the impactful results these companies have achieved, and learn how we can empower your security team to stay ahead of threats and build lasting resilience.</p><h2 id="toyota-motors-north-america-defends-the-human-identity-attack-surface">Toyota Motors North America Defends the Human Identity Attack Surface</h2><p><em>&quot;The timeliness of being able to take compromised credentials out of the marketplace is really beneficial.&quot;</em>  Curtis Hartsell, CTI Manager, Toyota Motors North America (<a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/videos/toyota" target="_blank">watch the full video here</a>)</p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/Tdd9/reports/2024-dbir-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf" target="_blank">2024 Verizon Data Breach Investigation Report</a>, 31% of all breaches over the last 10 years have involved the use of stolen credentials. With the rise of stealthy infostealers, threat actors are more likely to log in with stolen credentials than hack their way in. The Verizon report also found more than a thousand credentials being posted for sale on the dark web each day, with an average price of $10, proving that theres serious demand from cybercriminals. </p><p>To help Toyota Motors North America gain an edge, Cyber Threat Intelligence Manager Curtis Hartsell relies on Recorded Futures <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/identity-intelligence" target="_blank">Identity Intelligence Module</a>. The product allows Hartsell and team to take swift action on compromised credentials, automating credential resets before bad actors can gain access to the companys systems. </p><p>In one example, he said, We had a compromised credential at 7 oclock. Two hours later Identity [Intelligence] is notifying of those compromised credentials, and about thirty or forty minutes after the Identity Module alert, we see attempts to use that account. </p><p>Immediate visibility into newly compromised credentials helps Toyota Motors North America automate response actions and secure accounts instantly. This automation eliminates the need for constant manual intervention, allowing Hartsell and team to focus on higher-value tasks. </p><h2 id="cummins-identifies-and-reduces-attack-surface-risk">Cummins Identifies and Reduces Attack Surface Risk</h2><p><em>We have two main problem statements when were looking at this attack surface problem: What is our attack surface? And then how do we secure it? Theres a couple of different actions you take, whether its remediation or reduction. We love reduction. If it cant be on the internet. Great. Lets get it off there.</em>  Mattheus Bittick, Attack Surface Reduction Analyst, Cummins (watch the full video <a href="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/channel/06bopitbe1?wchannelid=06bopitbe1&wmediaid=1j7x7zezcc" target="_blank">here</a>)</p><p>Continuous monitoring of your first-party attack surface  everything in your network and systems that can be accessed from the internet   is resource-intensive and challenging, especially given that employees and contractors often spin up assets outside your security teams purview. This should be a major concern, as 76% of organizations have suffered a cyberattack that started with the exploit of an unknown, unmanaged, or poorly managed internet-facing asset (<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/opinion/Why-companies-need-attack-surface-management-in-2024" target="_blank">TechTarget</a>).</p><p>Before implementing Recorded Futures <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/attack-surface-intelligence" target="_blank">Attack Surface Intelligence Module</a>, Cummins Attack Surface Reduction Analyst Mattheus Bittick said his team spent around 80 hours per week trying to analyze and map the companys external attack surface. And even then, the team was blind to around 20% of the landscape. </p><p>With no capacity for continuous scanning and information-gathering and no existing inventory specific to external-facing assets, Bitticks team was unable to prioritize risks based on the attackers perspective. And since the company has had an internet presence for a long period of time, there was a large unexplored landscape of unknown unknowns and abandoned infrastructure. </p><p>Now, Attack Surface Intelligence is a central technology for the Cummins Attack Surface Risk Management Program.</p><p><em>The first tool I go to every morning is Attack Surface Intelligence. Whats new today? Whats going on that we need to prioritize and triage? Recorded Future shows us how we can take action, and takes our risk assessments to the next level.</em>  Mattheus Bittick, Attack Surface Reduction Analyst, Cummins</p><p>Thanks to automated discovery and attribution of assets associated with the organization, Bittick and team get a real-time view of their external attack surface, from the same perspective as an attacker. This increased visibility into key areas of risk like vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and shadow IT has helped Cummins reduce its vulnerable attack surface by 51% over a period of six months. And by removing key areas of risk and decommissioning forgotten infrastructure, the company has reduced its cyber insurance premiums by 32% year-over-year. </p><h2 id="novavax-proactively-monitors-for-third-party-vendor-breaches">Novavax Proactively Monitors for Third-Party Vendor Breaches</h2><p><em>We sharpened a lot of processes by introducing Third-Party Intelligence to our risk assessments, so we can make informed decisions about the vendors we do business with[Recorded Future] gives us an opportunity to launch an investigation to see what the vendor has access to, what we need to be concerned about, and how we can better protect ourselves.</em>  Nathalie Salisbury, Strategic Threat Intelligence Analyst, Novavax (Watch the full video <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/videos/novavax" target="_blank">here</a>)</p><p>Since third-party vendors arent always held to the same standards as enterprise organizations, those with spotty security hygiene can become the soft underbelly of your attack surface. <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/Tdd9/reports/2024-dbir-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf" target="_blank">According to the 2024 Verizon Data Breach Investigation Report</a>, 15% of breaches involved a third party or supplier. And the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/documents/us-en/107a02e94948f4ec" target="_blank">IBM Cost of a Data Breach 2024 Report</a> found that the average cost of a breach increased by $240,599 when it came via a third party.</p><p>Making matters worse, supply chain partners often delay or withhold disclosure of security incidents due to concerns about reputation and liability. As they take time to investigate and formulate damage-control strategies, the companies that rely on them may be unaware that their own systems are under attack or that their data has been compromised.</p><p>Nathalie Salisbury, Strategic Threat Intelligence Analyst at <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/case-study/novavax" target="_blank">Novavax</a>, says that Recorded Futures <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/third-party-intelligence" target="_blank">Third-Party Intelligence Module</a> shines a light on these risks before vendors disclose them. </p><p>A couple of times now, Recorded Future has alerted us to something prior to the third-party vendor, she said. Thats huge when were trying to protect our data. That gives us an opportunity to launch an investigation and see what the compromised vendor had access to, [what] we need to be concerned about, and [how to] evaluate our overall third-party risk.</p><p>As a result, Recorded Future is a critical part of the teams proactive approach to managing their third-party attack surface, both in evaluating new vendors and continuously monitoring existing ones. </p><h2 id="investbank-continuously-monitors-and-protects-against-vulnerabilities">INVESTBANK Continuously Monitors and Protects Against Vulnerabilities</h2><p><em>Vulnerability Intelligence provides access to a large database of exploits and vulnerabilities so that we can remit them faster and implement compensation controls until a patch is released.</em>  Riyad Jazmawi, Head of Information Security. (Read the full case study <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/case-study/investbank" target="_blank">here</a>).</p><p>Vulnerabilities continue to be one of the top initial access vectors for threat actors. In fact, 2024 might have been a watershed for vulnerability exploitation. When Verizon looked at the critical paths attackers use to initiate breaches, <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/Tdd9/reports/2024-dbir-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf" target="_blank">their research found</a> that vulnerability exploitation grew 3X year-over-year.</p><p>This will come as little surprise to those whove tracked prominent ransomware groups over the past year. The exploitation of Progress Softwares <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/2023-threat-analysis-and-2024-predictions" target="_blank">MOVEit</a> and other Managed File Transfer (MFT) products, such as <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/cleo-mft-cve-2024-50623-vulnerability-analysis" target="_blank">Cleo MFT</a>, have enabled threat actors to successfully pull off a number of large-scale breaches. </p><p><a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/case-study/investbank" target="_blank">INVESTBANK</a> wanted to respond more productively to zero-day exploits and vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild. As a fast-moving organization with many digital services, it needed to ensure that it could maintain continuous awareness of any PoCs or critical vulnerabilities in its tech stack. </p><p>Recorded Futures <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/vulnerability-intelligence" target="_blank">Vulnerability Intelligence Module</a> has helped the company improve its defenses against vulnerabilities.</p><p>Vulnerability Intelligence provides access to a large database of exploits and vulnerabilities so that we can remit them faster and implement compensation controls until a patch is released, said Riyad Jazmawi, Head of Information Security. </p><p>To reduce risk, organizations must have visibility into the vulnerabilities in their tech stacks, and they need the context to make patching prioritization decisions. <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/Tdd9/reports/2024-dbir-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf" target="_blank">Verizon</a> found that it takes 55 days to remediate 50% of CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) once patches become available. </p><p>With Recorded Futures Vulnerability Intelligence, you can pinpoint and take action on vulnerabilities to keep attackers from gaining access to your network and data.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>As a security leader, you need visibility into any first-party or third-party asset that could be targeted and exploited by threat actors  and you need context to understand how to prioritize and mitigate threats.To learn more about how Recorded Future can help you take the next step in strengthening your organizations defenses, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/demo?utm_campaign=demo-button-2023-top-nav-bar&utm_source=recordedfuture&utm_medium=website&utm_content=20231003&utm_term=website" target="_blank">request a custom demo</a>. </p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt group logo"></p><h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2><p>The German federal elections, scheduled for February 23, 2025, are the target of malign influence operations linked to Russia and Russia-based actors. As of mid-February 2025, Insikt Group assesses that, despite their persistence, these efforts have very likely not meaningfully altered voter behavior or shaped public opinion in a manner advantageous to Russias broader geopolitical interests, consistent with <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-impact-of-russian-interference-on-germanys-2017-elections/">assessments</a> of Russian meddling attempts in previous German election cycles. </p><p>The influence operations and corresponding networks tracked in this report  Doppelgnger, Operation Overload, CopyCop, Operation Undercut, and the Russia-based Foundation to Battle Injustice  are longstanding and at least partially Kremlin-funded. These operations almost certainly seek to incite and escalate German domestic socio-political conflicts, pollute the German information space by introducing manipulated content, foster criticism of the United States (US) and European Union (EU) and European integration, and undermine North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) cohesion in line with the Kremlins strategic objectives.</p><p>The 2025 German election cycle marks a period of evolution for several of these operations, while core narratives remain unchanged. For example, Doppelgnger and Operation Overload have expanded beyond mainstream social media to Bluesky Social (Bluesky), in an attempt to capture migrating audiences. Doppelgnger and CopyCop have launched new brands and websites to project influence and reinforce messaging in the face of intensified scrutiny of their operations. Operation Overload continues to use artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools, including the use of AI-enabled voice cloning technology to create audio deepfakes, while both Operation Overload and Operation Undercut pose as real news organizations to increase their credibility.</p><p>Despite limited evidence that these operations have meaningfully influenced voter behavior, they still pose broader risks to media integrity and public trust. Narratives undermining election security or integrity could reduce voter turnout, while media engagement with inauthentic content  rather than exposing the tactics behind it  may amplify malign messaging. Regarding Operation Overload specifically, we continue to assess that the potential for significant breakout does exist, as evidenced in the <a href="https://meduza.io/en/feature/2025/02/06/elon-musk-and-trump-jr-repost-fake-e-news-video-about-usaid-created-by-pro-kremlin-disinformation-network">viral spread</a> of a recent video attributed to this network that disparaged the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in social media. To mitigate these risks, media entities, the public sector, and researchers should continue monitoring known influence networks while limiting engagement with operations such as Doppelgnger, Operation Overload, and Operation Undercut. Impersonated organizations should engage takedown services for malicious domains, collaborate with platform trust and safety teams, and proactively detect brand abuse tactics like typosquatting and logo manipulation.</p><h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2><ul><li>The German federal elections are the target of malign influence operations attributed to Russia and Russia-based actors.</li><li>Russia-attributed influence operations have promoted and will very likely continue to support German political parties Russia views as beneficial to its own geopolitical interests, particularly Alternative fr Deutschland (AfD). </li><li>Doppelgnger is very likely exerting influence through at least seven new inauthentic news brands, in addition to the operations persistent media impersonation activities, to exacerbate political fissures and inflame political discourse surrounding European integration, immigration, and economic matters. </li><li>Operation Overloads media impersonations aim to sow distrust among German citizens toward the safety and integrity of voting, attack the characters of key political leaders, and present Germany as a rising hotbed of antisemitism and extremism.</li><li>Insikt Group detected at least 94 new inauthentic websites  whose creation began in November 2024 after the announcement of upcoming snap elections  that we attribute to CopyCop impersonating German-language news websites.</li><li>Following Insikt Groups November 2024 investigation into Operation Undercut, we have observed the network continuing to post German-language content supporting AfD and undermining German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.</li><li>The Foundation to Battle Injustice very likely seeks to undermine the reputations of German political leaders while promoting political platforms aligned with Russian interests through inauthentic investigative articles.</li></ul><h2 id="new-doppelgnger-brands-target-key-german-election-issues">New Doppelgnger Brands Target Key German Election Issues</h2><p>Insikt Group has detected at least eight new websites acting as original news brands, in addition to continued media impersonation with social media promotion, which we attribute to Doppelgnger, a longstanding Russian influence operation. <a href="https://www.disinfo.eu/doppelganger-operation/">Doppelgnger</a> is very likely positioning these newly established websites  previously not linked to the network  to sustain its influence operations targeting European political leadership and to exacerbate political fissures surrounding European integration, immigration, economic matters, and more. Throughout 2024, researchers, government entities, and technology companies <a href="https://www.qurium.org/alerts/exposing-the-evil-empire-of-doppelganger-disinformation/">continued</a> <a href="https://www.qurium.org/forensics/when-kehr-meets-vextrio/">exposing</a> Doppelgnger&#39;s activities across Europe and North America, leading to a US Department of Justice <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-disrupts-covert-russian-government-sponsored-foreign-malign-influence">indictment</a> against its operators at the Social Design Agency (SDA), international sanctions on SDA and affiliated entities, and at least partial  though often temporary  disruptions to its operations through takedowns and seizures. In response, SDA typically attempted to reestablish its operations within hours to days by deploying new infrastructure.</p><p>While Doppelgnger is best known for the <a href="https://www.disinfo.eu/doppelganger/">direct impersonation</a> of legitimate Western media organizations, the influence operation has also managed a multitude of its own original news website brands, each targeting a specific country (such as Germany), with content directly tailored to the key domestic and foreign policy issues of that target audience, such as immigration policy, Germanys ongoing socio-economic challenges, and questions of Germanys place as Europes leader (as seen in <strong>Figure 1</strong>). Insikt Group has observed Doppelgnger abandoning several of its legacy brand websites with attempts to establish new brands, including multiple websites specific to German politics, likely due to a combination of repeated discovery and disruption of several of these websites. </p><p>While we continue to observe Doppelgnger evolve its tactics and attempt to evade defenders, its ability to meaningfully impact public discourse very likely remains limited. Despite continued efforts to expand its network, Doppelgnger remains constrained by low levels of engagement, with minimal views and interactions across its newly launched domains and social media brands.</p><h3 id="using-new-infrastructure-to-deliver-old-themes">Using New Infrastructure to Deliver Old Themes</h3><p>Since October 2024, Insikt Group has tracked a series of new domain registrations, discovering web page infrastructure that overlaps with previously attributed Doppelgnger-controlled domains.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt group logo"></p><h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2><p>Between December 2024 and January 2025, Recorded Futures Insikt Group identified a campaign exploiting unpatched internet-facing Cisco network devices primarily associated with global telecommunications providers. Victim organizations included a United States-based affiliate of a United Kingdom-based telecommunications provider and a South African telecommunications provider. Insikt Group attributes this activity to the Chinese state-sponsored threat activity group tracked by Insikt Group as RedMike, which aligns with the Microsoft-named group Salt Typhoon. Using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group observed RedMike target and exploit unpatched Cisco network devices vulnerable to CVE-2023-20198, a privilege escalation vulnerability found in the web user interface (UI) feature in Cisco IOS XE software, for initial access before exploiting an associated privilege escalation vulnerability, CVE-2023-20273, to gain root privileges. RedMike reconfigures the device, adding a generic routing encapsulation (GRE) tunnel for persistent access.</p><p>RedMike has attempted to exploit more than 1,000 Cisco devices globally. The group likely compiled a list of target devices based on their association with telecommunications providers&#39; networks. Insikt Group also observed RedMike targeting devices associated with universities in Argentina, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Thailand, the United States (US), and Vietnam. RedMike possibly targeted these universities to access research in areas related to telecommunications, engineering, and technology, particularly at institutions like UCLA and TU Delft. In addition to this activity, in mid-December 2024, RedMike also carried out a reconnaissance of multiple IP addresses owned by a Myanmar-based telecommunications provider, Mytel.</p><p>Unpatched public-facing appliances serve as direct entry points into an organizations infrastructure. Sophisticated Chinese threat activity groups have <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2023-1107.pdf">shifted</a> heavily toward exploiting these devices for initial access over the past five years. RedMikes exploitation of telecommunications infrastructure goes beyond technical vulnerabilities and represents a strategic intelligence threat. Persistent access to critical communications networks enables state-backed threat actors to monitor confidential conversations, manipulate data flows, and disrupt services during geopolitical conflicts. RedMikes targeting of lawful intercept programs and US political figures highlights the strategic intelligence objectives behind these operations and the national security threat they pose.</p><p>Organizations, particularly those in the telecommunications industry, must prioritize remediating exposed network devices, as unpatched systems remain a key initial access vector for Chinese state-sponsored threat activity groups. Network administrators should implement strict access controls, disable unnecessary web UI exposure, and monitor for unauthorized configuration changes. Individuals should use end-to-end encrypted communication methods for sensitive information, just as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) recommended, which is crucial to mitigate potential eavesdropping risks.</p><p>Additionally, governments and cybersecurity entities should improve threat intelligence sharing and impose stricter regulatory compliance for network security. While the US sanctions on RedMike-affiliated Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology signal a more assertive and commendable stance against state-backed cyber espionage in critical infrastructure, robust international cooperation is crucial for effectively countering these persistent threats.</p><h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2><ul><li>Despite significant media coverage and US sanctions, RedMike continues to compromise telecommunications providers globally, including in the US.</li><li>RedMike compromised Cisco network devices of a US-based affiliate of a United Kingdom (UK) telecommunications provider and a South African telecommunications provider.</li><li>RedMike exploited privilege escalation vulnerabilities CVE-2023-20198 and CVE-2023-20273 to compromise unpatched Cisco network devices running Cisco IOS XE software.</li><li>Using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified RedMike attempting to exploit over 1,000 Cisco network devices between December 2024 and January 2025.</li></ul><h2 id="background">Background</h2><p>In late September 2024, media reporting (<a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/china-cyberattack-internet-providers-260bd835?st=cYA8J5&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink">1</a>, <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/chinas-salt-typhoon-hacked-att-verizon-report/">2</a>) stated that the Chinese state-sponsored group Salt Typhoon had compromised the networks of major US telecommunications companies, including Verizon (<a href="">1</a>), AT&amp;T, and Lumen Technologies. The activity likely affected telecommunications organizations globally, with some outlets <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/national-security-daily/2024/12/12/we-need-to-talk-about-salt-typhoon-00183727">reporting</a> that Salt Typhoon compromised at least 80 organizations. SaltTyphoon used its access to telecommunications providers to snoop on <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/salt-typhoon-apt-subverts-law-enforcement-wiretapping">US lawful intercept</a> targets and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/25/trump-hack-china-phones-00185608">intercept</a> the communications of significant US political figures. The effect of Salt Typhoons intrusions has reached the highest levels of the US government: Cybersecurity experts have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-agencies-brief-senators-chinese-salt-typhoon-telecom-hacking-2024-12-04/">briefed</a> the US Senate, CISA recently <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/enhanced-visibility-and-hardening-guidance-communications-infrastructure">issued</a> guidance on hardening telecommunications infrastructure, and CISA and the FBI issued a joint <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/12/06/fbi-warns-iphone-and-android-users-stop-sending-texts/">warning</a> encouraging the use of encrypted end-to-end messaging applications for sensitive communications.</p><p>Insikt Group tracks Salt Typhoon-aligned activity as RedMike. Salt Typhoon is a group name given by Microsoft Threat Intelligence; at this time, Microsoft has not published publicly available technical details of the group&#39;s activity. The only public information Microsoft has shared confirms an <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/microsoft-threat-actor-naming">overlap</a> with two existing threat activity group names: GhostEmperor (<a href="https://securelist.com/ghostemperor-from-proxylogon-to-kernel-mode/104407/">Kaspersky</a>) and FamousSparrow (<a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/09/23/famoussparrow-suspicious-hotel-guest/">ESET</a>).</p><p>On January 17, 2025, the US Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2792">sanctioned</a> Sichuan-based cybersecurity company Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology Co., Ltd. for their direct involvement with RedMike activity. OFAC stated that Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology Co., Ltd. had direct involvement in exploiting US telecommunications and internet service provider companies. According to OFAC, Chinas Ministry of State Security (MSS) has maintained strong ties with multiple computer network exploitation companies, including Sichuan Juxinhe.</p><h2 id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis</h2><h3 id="cisco-ios-xe-web-ui-exploitation">Cisco IOS XE Web UI Exploitation</h3><p>Using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified that since early December 2024, RedMike has attempted to exploit over 1,000 internet-facing Cisco network devices worldwide, primarily those associated with telecommunications providers, using a combination of two privilege escalation vulnerabilities: CVE-2023-20198 and CVE-2023-20273. When successfully compromised, the group uses the new privileged user account to change the device&#39;s configuration and adds a GRE tunnel for persistent access and data exfiltration.</p><p>The privilege escalation vulnerability CVE-2023-20198 was found in the Cisco IOS XE software web UI feature, version 16 and earlier, and <a href="https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxe-webui-privesc-j22SaA4z">published</a> by Cisco in October 2023. Attackers exploit this vulnerability to gain initial access to the device and issue a <span style="font-family: Courier;">privilege 15</style> command to create a local user and password. Following this, the attacker uses the new local account to access the device and exploits an associated privilege escalation vulnerability, CVE-2023-20273, to gain root user privileges.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/redmike_salt_01_5eec44df76.png" alt="RedMike Cisco network"><em><strong>Figure 1:</strong> RedMike Cisco network device exploitation infrastructure (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><p>More than half of the Cisco devices targeted by RedMike were in the US, South America, and India. The remaining devices spanned over 100 other countries. Although the selected devices are primarily associated with telecommunications providers, thirteen were linked to universities across Argentina, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Thailand, the US, and Vietnam.</p><p>Often involved in cutting-edge research, universities are prime targets for Chinese state-sponsored threat activity groups to acquire valuable research data and intellectual property. Previous examples include APT40, which has <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa21-200a">targeted</a> universities for biomedical, robotics, and maritime research; RedGolf (APT41) <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/seven-international-cyber-defendants-including-apt41-actors-charged-connection-computer">for</a> medical research; and RedBravo (APT31), which has directly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/apt31-chinese-hacking-group-behind-global-cyberespionage-campaign-2024-03-26/">targeted</a> academics. Chinas cyber strategy <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2023-1107.pdf">aligns</a> with its broader economic and military goals, making universities high-value targets for long-term intelligence-gathering and technology acquisition.</p><p>RedMike possibly targeted the following universities to access research in areas related to telecommunications, engineering, and technology, particularly at institutions like <a href="https://wireless.ee.ucla.edu/research/">UCLA</a> and <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/ee/msc-electrical-engineering/track-wireless-communication-and-sensing/related-research/">TU Delft</a>.</p><ul><li>University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)  US</li><li>California State University, Office of the Chancellor (CENIC)  US</li><li>Loyola Marymount University  US</li><li>Utah Tech University  US</li><li>Universidad de La Punta  Argentina</li><li>Islamic University of Technology (IUT)  Bangladesh</li><li>Universitas Sebelas Maret  Indonesia</li><li>Universitas Negeri Malang  Indonesia</li><li>University of Malaya  Malaysia</li><li>Universidad Nacional Autonoma  Mexico</li><li>Technische Universiteit Delft  The Netherlands</li><li>Sripatum University  Thailand</li><li>University of Medicine and Pharmacy at Ho Chi Minh City  Vietnam</li></ul><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/redmike_salt_02_976987d723.png" alt="Geographical spread of Cisco"><em><strong>Figure 2</strong>: Geographical spread of Cisco devices targeted by RedMike (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><p>RedMikes scanning and exploitation activity occurred on six different occasions from December 2024 to January 2025.</p><ul><li>2024-12-04 </li><li>2024-12-10</li><li>2024-12-17</li><li>2024-12-24</li><li>2025-01-13</li><li>2025-01-23</li></ul><p>Network administrators operating a Cisco network device with IOS XE software web UI exposed to the internet can use the dates mentioned and advice in the mitigations section to identify potential RedMike exploitation activity.</p><p>Using internet scanning data, Insikt Group identified more than 12,000 Cisco network devices with their web UIs exposed to the internet. Although over 1,000 Cisco devices were targeted, Insikt Group assesses that this activity was likely focussed, given that this number only represents 8% of the exposed devices and that RedMike engaged in periodic reconnaissance activity, selecting devices linked to telecommunications providers.</p><h3 id="compromised-telecommunications-provider-devices">Compromised Telecommunications Provider Devices</h3><p>Using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group observed seven compromised Cisco network devices communicating with RedMike infrastructure. These include devices associated with:</p><ul><li>A US-based affiliate of a UK telecommunications provider</li><li>A US internet service provider (ISP) and telecommunications company</li><li>A South African telecommunications provider</li><li>An Italian ISP</li><li>A large Thailand telecommunications provider</li></ul><p>RedMike configured GRE tunnels between the compromised Cisco devices and their infrastructure. GRE is a tunneling protocol used to encapsulate various network layer protocols inside point-to-point connections. It is a standard feature that can be configured on Cisco network devices. It is commonly used to create virtual private networks (VPNs), enable interoperability between different network types, and transport multicast or non-IP traffic over IP networks. Threat activity groups use GRE tunnels to maintain persistence by establishing covert communication channels that bypass firewalls and intrusion detection systems. These tunnels also facilitate stealthy data exfiltration by encapsulating stolen data within GRE packets, potentially bypassing network monitoring.</p><h3 id="reconnaissance-of-myanmar-telecommunications-provider">Reconnaissance of Myanmar Telecommunications Provider</h3><p>In mid-December 2024, RedMike, from the same infrastructure that exploited the Cisco network devices, performed reconnaissance against multiple infrastructure assets operated by a Myanmar-based telecommunications provider, Mytel, likely including their corporate mail server.</p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-cn-2025-0213.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>]]></content:encoded>

These operatives not only violate international sanctions but also pose severe cybersecurity threats, engaging in fraud and data theft and potentially disrupting business operations.</p><p>Beyond financial fraud, these IT workers have been linked to cyber espionage. Insikt Group tracks PurpleBravo (formerly Threat Activity Group 120 [TAG-120]), a North Korean-linked cluster that overlaps with the Contagious Interview campaign, which primarily targets software developers in the cryptocurrency industry. The campaign employs malware such as BeaverTail, an infostealer that gathers sensitive information; InvisibleFerret, a cross-platform Python backdoor; and OtterCookie, a tool used to establish persistent access on compromised systems. At least three organizations in the broader cryptocurrency space were targeted by PurpleBravo between October and November 2024: a market-making company, an online casino, and a software development company.</p><p>The findings also highlight North Koreas expansion into other areas of fraud, with the establishment of front companies that mimic legitimate IT firms. TAG-121, a separate cluster of activity, has been identified as operating a network of these companies across China. Each front company spoofs a different legitimate organization by copying large parts of their website. These entities create an added layer of deniability and make detection more challenging, allowing North Korean actors to further embed themselves in global IT supply chains.</p><p>The implications of this threat are far-reaching. Organizations that unknowingly hire North Korean IT workers may be in violation of international sanctions, exposing themselves to legal and financial repercussions. More critically, these workers almost certainly act as insider threats, stealing proprietary information, introducing backdoors, or facilitating larger cyber operations. Given North Koreas history of financial theft, the risks extend beyond individual companies to the broader global financial system and national security interests.</p><p>To mitigate these threats, organizations must adopt stringent identity verification measures, ensuring that remote hires undergo thorough screening. This includes requiring video interviews, notarized identification documents, and continuous monitoring of remote workers for anomalies. Employers should also implement technical controls to detect unauthorized access, restrict data exposure, and flag suspicious remote connections. Awareness and training for human resources (HR) teams and IT security personnel are essential in preventing these actors from infiltrating critical business operations.</p><p>While the threat posed by North Korean IT workers is a fraud issue, it is also a key component of a sophisticated cyber strategy that financially sustains an internationally sanctioned regime. As these operations continue to evolve, businesses, governments, and cybersecurity organizations must work together to close the gaps that enable North Korea to exploit the remote work environment.</p><h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2><ul><li>North Koreas use of IT workers to secure fraudulent employment and execute coordinated cyber campaigns highlights its evolving tactics to fund its military programs while undermining global intellectual property security.</li><li>Insikt Group assesses that PurpleBravo has targeted at least seven entities, three of which are in the cryptocurrency sector, including a market-making firm, an online casino, and a software company.</li><li>Insikt Group found evidence that PurpleBravo uses Astrill VPN to manage its command-and-control (C2) servers. </li><li>PurpleBravo was found posting job advertisements on at least three hiring websites, Telegram, and GitHub.</li><li>Insikt Group identified at least seven suspected North Korean-linked front companies operating in China spoofing legitimate IT firms in China, India, Pakistan, Ukraine, and the United States (US).</li><li>Organizations should implement robust technical safeguards, such as, where feasible, disabling remote desktop software, conducting regular checks of open ports across networks, deploying insider threat monitoring, and geolocating devices.</li><li>Insikt Group expects to continue to see groups like PurpleBravo and TAG-121 exploit the remote work environment, threatening global IT supply chains and intellectual property.</li><li>North Koreas shift toward fraudulent remote employment and front companies will likely outpace traditional hiring protocol checks, driving organizations and governments to adopt more rigorous identity verification, enhanced remote work security, and robust international intelligence-sharing to counter this expanding threat.</li></ul><h2 id="background">Background</h2><p>On January 23, 2025, the US Department of Justice (US DOJ) <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-north-korean-nationals-and-three-facilitators-indicted-multi-year-fraudulent-remote">indicted</a> two North Korean nationals and three facilitators for remote worker fraud that enriched the North Korean regime. In the indictment, the US DOJ described a six-year scheme in which two US citizens and one Mexican national conspired with North Korean IT workers to remotely work for at least 64 US companies. Payments from ten companies generated at least $866,255 in revenue that was laundered through a Chinese bank account. In addition to the indictment, stories of organizations and individuals that have come across North Korean IT workers can be regularly found in open sources (<a href="https://x.com/zachxbt/status/1824047425822310580">1</a>, <a href="https://sohay666.github.io/article/en/reversing-scam-interview-base-on-js-project.html">2</a>, <a href="https://www.knowbe4.com/press/knowbe4-issues-warning-to-organizations-after-hiring-fake-north-korean-employee">3</a>). Besides sanctions violations, the threat from these workers, whether stealing sensitive data or installing malware on internal systems, presents unique challenges to organizations, especially in remote work environments.</p><p>North Korea remains highly isolated from the outside world due to the regimes strict control over goods, people, and information, as well as international sanctions placed upon the country. Despite this, Pyongyangs leadership is <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/north-korea-internet-activity">well-versed</a> in exploiting emerging technologies to fund its operations. As sanctions have tightened, the regime <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/north-korea-cyber-activity">adapted</a> by escalating illicit activities, including smuggling and cybercrime. In recent years, the regime has achieved significant <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/crypto-country-north-koreas-targeting-cryptocurrency">success</a> in stealing from traditional financial institutions and digital assets like cryptocurrency. Between 2020 and 2024, the rise of remote work created new opportunities for North Korea to deploy skilled IT workers who infiltrate global companies under false identities. Their activities directly support the regimes military programs while posing a significant threat to industries reliant on intellectual property.</p><p>Research into North Korean IT workers has focused on the following aspects of the threat: North Korean IT workers gaining fraudulent <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/mitigating-dprk-it-worker-threat">employment</a> through proxies; North Korean <a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/dprk-it-workers-a-network-of-active-front-companies-and-their-links-to-china/">front companies</a>, often in the software development space, imitating legitimate organizations; and <a href="https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/pyongyang-your-payroll-rise-north-korean-remote-workers-west">fake</a> employment opportunities targeting software developers in cryptocurrency and AI, among other industries. Other research has established <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/fake-north-korean-it-worker-activity-cluster/">links</a> between IT workers and ongoing malicious campaigns by North Korean threat actors. </p><h2 id="threat-analysis">Threat Analysis</h2><h3 id="purplebravo">PurpleBravo</h3><p>The Contagious Interview campaign, first <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/two-campaigns-by-north-korea-bad-actors-target-job-hunters/">documented</a> in November 2023, targeted software developers primarily in the cryptocurrency space and was attributed to North Korea. The campaign used the JavaScript infostealer BeaverTail, the cross-platform Python backdoor InvisibleFerret, and most recently OtterCookie, a new backdoor <a href="https://jp.security.ntt/tech_blog/contagious-interview-ottercookie">identified</a> in December 2024. The group responsible for this activity is known as CL-STA-0240, Famous Chollima, and Tenacious Pungsan in open sources. Insikt Group has given this cluster of activity the designation PurpleBravo (formerly TAG-120).</p><h4 id="purplebravos-fraudulent-profiles">PurpleBravos Fraudulent Profiles</h4><p>On December 3, 2024, a developer posted a <a href="https://sohay666.github.io/article/en/reversing-scam-interview-base-on-js-project.html">blog</a> about their experience with a suspected PurpleBravo operator. An individual claiming to be a recruiter contacted them about a job offer and then followed up with an interview. During the interview, the interviewer asked the developer to download a coding challenge from a repository. The developer realized there was a malicious function in the file and ended the interview. While the developer does not attribute the malware or actor, Insikt Group assesses with high confidence the file is a BeaverTail infostealer.</p><p>The interviewer used a LinkedIn account with the name Javier Fiesco, who describes themself as the CTO of AgencyHill99. Further investigation into Javier Fiesco <a href="https://remote3.co/p/javier0923">uncovered</a> an individual with the same name available for work on remote3, a Web3 development job board. The website <em>agencyhill99[.]com</em> was registered on Hostinger on September 13, 2024. As of early February 2025, this website no longer resolved, but it previously <a href="https://urlscan.io/result/cf20d730-529f-42fe-b5dc-befb1d9b8a66">displayed</a> a Hostinger landing page.

Additionally, a <a href="https://dorahacks.io/hacker/U_6b2d92accc9944/">profile</a> with the name of Lucifer, and what appears to be an AI-generated headshot, who works for AgencyHill99 was observed on the website DoraHacks, which is a hackathon, bounty, and grant organization. The profile on DoraHacks states that AgencyHill99 is looking to hire a developer. Insikt Group also discovered a <a href="https://intch.org/company/agencyhill99">company</a> with the name Agencyhill99 on the website Intch, a part-time and remote job platform. The company posted a Part-Time IT Developer Opportunity by an individual with the name Newton Curtis, who is a recruiter at AgencyHill99.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/purplebravo_01_8dc976a492.png" alt="PurpleBravo operator"><em><strong>Figure 1</strong>: PurpleBravo operators account on DoraHacks (Source: <a href="https://dorahacks.io/hacker/U_6b2d92accc9944/">DoraHacks</a>)</em></p><p>Insikt Group found several posts in Telegram channels from individuals with <em>@agencyhill99[.]com</em> email addresses advertising jobs.

A GitHub user, dev-astro-star, made several commits to the repository between October 9 and 19, 2024. Based on the commits, it appears the website used Firebase, a Google backend service for web applications.

The link was then updated to <em>hxxp://locahost[:]3000/BattleTank[.]rar</em>.</p><h4 id="purplebravo-malware-and-infrastructure">PurpleBravo Malware and Infrastructure</h4><p>PurpleBravo uses the malware families BeaverTail, InvisibleFerret, and OtterCookie. BeaverTail is a malware family initially distributed via NPM packages as a JavaScript payload and later as executables and downloaders targeting Windows and macOS environments. BeaverTail also acts as an infostealer, gathering cryptocurrency wallet and browser information. InvisibleFerret is a collection of post-compromise payloads that collectively act as a backdoor in victim environments. InvisibleFerret introduces additional malicious payloads into victim environments, performs information stealing and fingerprinting actions within the victim environment, and leverages legitimate protocols and software for C2 communications. Like InvisibleFerret, OtterCookie is a post-compromise malware family used as a backdoor, which establishes C2 connectivity via Socket[.]IO, receives and executes shell commands from C2 servers, and exfiltrates sensitive victim data.</p><p>Insikt Group analyzed BeaverTail, InvisibleFerret, and OtterCookie malware samples (See <strong>Appendix B</strong> for related file hashes). The BeaverTail samples were identified as PE variants targeting Windows environments. These samples included URLs linked to <em>freeconference[.]com</em>, a legitimate conferencing website, which aligns with Unit42s <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/north-korean-threat-actors-lure-tech-job-seekers-as-fake-recruiters/">findings</a> of Contagious Interview payloads posing as FreeConference executables. The OtterCookie samples were two separate versions of the malware family; however, static analysis of these samples included strings that demonstrated both samples ability to gather and send system fingerprinting information to attacker C2 servers, including strings that indicated OtterCookie is capable of identifying cryptocurrency assets and sensitive information found in specific file types by using regex patterns, including executables, photos, and config and env files, among others.</p><p>The InvisibleFerret samples analyzed were Python scripts with the following functionalities: </p><ul><li>Determining victim device location via local IP address lookup</li><li>Fingerprinting device details (user and hostname)</li><li>Connecting to a Base64-encoded C2 address via HTTP POST requests</li><li>Performing local directory discovery using hard-coded strings</li><li>Creating a reverse shell for SSH session management and data exfiltration</li><li>Copying clipboard data, keylogging, and tracking mouse movements.</li></ul><p>Previous samples of InvisibleFerret were <a href="https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/pyongyang-your-payroll-rise-north-korean-remote-workers-west">analyzed</a> by Zscaler, which described a two-part infection chain in which the initial reconnaissance took place over HTTP traffic and FTP was used for data exfiltration, as shown in <strong>Figure 2</strong>.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/purplebravo_02_601227dd0c.png" alt="InvisibleFerret"><em><strong>Figure 2</strong>: InvisibleFerret Infection chain (Source: Recorded Future and <a href="https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/pyongyang-your-payroll-rise-north-korean-remote-workers-west">Zscaler</a>)</em></p><p>Insikt Group identified 21 PurpleBravo servers between August 2024 and February 2025 (see <strong>Appendix B</strong> for the complete list). The majority of servers use Tier[.]Net hosting, with Majestic Hosting, Stark Industries, Leaseweb Singapore, and Kaopu Cloud HK also being used in this campaign. Insikt Group has previously observed other North Korean threat groups favor many of these hosting providers. In addition to the C2 servers, using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group observed at least seven suspected victims between September 2024 and February 13, 2025. The victims are located in at least six countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Costa Rica, India, Vietnam, Trkiye, and South Korea. Open-source <a href="https://spur.us/astrill-vpn-and-remote-worker-fraud/">research</a> identified Astrill VPN as a favored service by North Korean IT workers, with <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/mitigating-dprk-it-worker-threat">evidence</a> that they use the service with remote administration tools. Insikt Group also observed network traffic between known Astrill VPN endpoints and PurpleBravo servers, corroborating this connection.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/purplebravo_03_7060a07d32.png" alt="PurpleBravo victims"><em><strong>Figure 3</strong>: Location of PurpleBravo victims (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><p>At least three victims in the cryptocurrency space were identified in the findings summarized below:</p><ul><li>On October 3, 2024, Insikt Group observed likely reconnaissance traffic between a BeaverTail C2 and a market-making company in the cryptocurrency space based in the United Arab Emirates.

            <description><![CDATA[Prepare your business for potential geopolitical disruptions from a Taiwan invasion. Assess evolving risks, global economic impacts, and strategic measures to safeguard supply chains and critical operations in Asia.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png"></p><h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2><p>Businesses should now begin making preparatory investments to establish contingency plans in case of a Taiwan invasion, especially if they operate in Taiwan or China, rely heavily on supply chains or shipping in Asia, or are located in countries likely to oppose Chinas geopolitical objectives. While an invasion in the short term (20252026) is currently unlikely, the factors informing Insikt Groups assessment are rapidly evolving. Beginning in 2027 and continuing through the long term (20272049), the risk of an invasion will very likely continue to increase, though it is not inevitable that an invasion will occur. In the short term, China is almost certain to continue its current coercive efforts, including major military exercises and incursions into maritime and air spaces near Taiwan, while seeking ways to incrementally escalate such coercion below the level of an invasion. In these efforts, China is likely to initiate a temporary law enforcement-led quarantine and a disruptive cyber campaign against Taiwans critical infrastructure.</p><p>Our assessment is based on a range of behaviors and trends across China, Taiwan, and the United States (US), as described in the <strong>Key Findings</strong> below, and in consideration of Chinas broader geopolitical context (see <strong>Appendix A</strong>). Fundamentally, in the short term, we assess that  absent a specific catalyst that leads to war (such as if Taiwan were to declare formal independence)   the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership is very likely to remain focused on improving domestic conditions and strengthening preparations for navigating tensions with the US, a potential invasion of Taiwan, or other conflict with foreign powers (such as over the South China Sea). In the long term, we assess that China will likely have established a level of preparedness across the military, economic, social, and other domains by 2027 that would enable its leadership to invade Taiwan as a war of choice (rather than in response to a specific catalyst) while minimizing associated costs and risks. </p><p>Our assessment is generally aligned with public statements by Taiwan and US government and military officials since the start of 2023, both of which emphasize active preparations regardless of speculation about specific timelines. More specifically, Taiwan officials express that an invasion is currently unlikely despite the potential for a diversionary war to distract from Chinas domestic economic challenges. They also highlight weaknesses in the Peoples Liberation Armys (PLAs) amphibious capability while recognizing the PLA could likely execute a blockade of Taiwan  the foremost alternative to an invasion. US officials express that an invasion is not imminent or inevitable, but that the risk is increasing and that Chinas forces are on track to meet their modernization and readiness goals. </p><p>An invasion would almost certainly severely impact the global economy, disrupting critical shipping lanes, devastating the semiconductor industry, and imposing broad costs on Taiwan, China, and potentially the US. Businesses likely to be affected by a Taiwan invasion scenario should consider taking steps such as building relationships with potential alternative suppliers outside of Asia, evaluating the purchase of war risk insurance, conducting scenario-based stress tests to identify vulnerabilities in operations and investments, maintaining encrypted offline backups of key computer systems and data, isolating high-value computer systems to limit an adversarys lateral movement in case of a breach, and purchasing a geopolitical threat intelligence capability to support ongoing monitoring of the Taiwan issue (additional recommendations can be found in the <strong>Preparing for Potential Global Economic Disruption</strong> section of this report). Indicators of escalation to support monitoring are provided in <strong>Appendix B</strong>. Given the public focus on the impact of an invasion on Taiwans semiconductor industry, <strong>Appendix C</strong> further offers our assessment of why that industry is not especially relevant to judging if or when China might invade.</p><h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2><p>Assessments supporting our judgment that an invasion is unlikely in the short term include:</p><p>China almost certainly continues to prefer peaceful reunification and very likely continues to invest in a dual-track strategy that combines economic inducements with coercive elements.Chinas economy is facing challenges that are very likely holding the focus of leadership as they strive to attain national rejuvenation. Despite PLA progress in developing capabilities necessary for a successful invasion of Taiwan, Chinas military continues to have limitations in areas that suggest it is not yet ready to undertake an invasion.Chinas leadership has likely not begun telling the public to prepare for war and public support for a war is likely not at levels the CCP would prefer before ordering an invasion. Although long-term public opinion trends in Taiwan are unfavorable to Chinas goals, polling results since 2020 likely suggest to Chinas leadership that its strategy is working to curb preferences for independence in the short term.</p><p>Assessments supporting our judgment of rising risk in the long term include:</p><p>The CCP has become increasingly assertive and very likely expectant of progress with regard to its goals for Taiwan.Under Xi Jinpings leadership, the CCP has taken administrative and other measures to develop a self-sufficient economy, harden against foreign economic coercion such as sanctions, decrease reliance on the US dollar, and prepare for shortages in strategic resources like grain and critical minerals.China-based cyber threat actors are targeting US critical infrastructure in ways that suggest their goal is to pre-position for a potential conflict. Chinas leadership has intensified its use of lawfare measures against Taiwan, particularly over the past year. The PLA, Chinas wider armed forces, and Chinas defense industry are continuing to improve capabilities that would be needed for a successful invasion of Taiwan, countering US intervention, and other scenarios.The political and social environments in Taiwan are both trending toward potentially permanent rejection of unification.Chinas leadership almost certainly perceives US government behavior as trending toward overturning its (the USs) one-China policy, which is one of Beijings likely red lines that could hasten an invasion scenario.</p><h2 id="indicators-an-invasion-is-unlikely-in-the-short-term">Indicators an Invasion Is Unlikely in the Short Term</h2><p>There are several elements of Chinas behavior that support our assessment that a Taiwan invasion is unlikely before 2027. These include Chinas almost certain continuing preference for peaceful reunification, indicators that it very likely continues to pursue a dual-track approach to Taiwan, economic challenges that very likely take priority given Chinas other ambitions, shortfalls in PLA capability, and limited indication that China has begun mobilizing its populace to brace for wartime hardship. Additionally, public opinion polling results in Taiwan since 2020 likely suggest to Chinas leadership that its coercive strategy is working to deter independence in the short term. In totality, we assess that  absent a specific catalyst that leads to war (such as if Taiwan declares formal independence or China assesses foreign military interference in Taiwan)   the CCP leadership is very likely, in the short term, to remain focused on improving domestic conditions and strengthening preparations for navigating tensions with the US, a potential invasion, or other conflict with a foreign power (for example, over the South China Sea).</p><h3 id="trends-in-china">Trends in China</h3><p>China almost certainly continues to prefer peaceful reunification and very likely continues to invest in a dual-track strategy that combines economic inducements with coercive elements.

These and other challenges have led to arguments that China could invade Taiwan to distract from domestic troubles (<a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/International-relations/Taiwan-tensions/China-could-threaten-war-in-2023-to-force-talks-Taiwan-official">1</a>, <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/china-more-likely-to-invade-taiwan-and-attack-could-come-in-2027-islands-foreign-minister-joseph-wu-warns-12789179">2</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/11/joe-biden-china-economy-time-bomb">3</a>, <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/desperate-times-desperate-measures-slowing-growth-making-china-more-dangerous">4</a>), but this is unlikely. First, diversionary war has not been the CCPs method for <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/myth-chinese-diversionary-war">managing</a> domestic crises since 1949. Second, the economic challenges are likely not great enough to <a href="https://www.prcleader.org/post/getting-to-world-class-can-china-s-military-persevere">derail</a> the PLAs ongoing modernization in ways that would limit Chinas option to use force in the future. During this period, Xi Jinping is very likely to focus on solving domestic economic problems while strengthening the military to support conditions for achieving national rejuvenation by 2049  a goal with an <a href="https://www.strategictranslation.org/glossary/great-rejuvenation-of-the-chinese-nation">economic component</a>  and to prepare for unifying with Taiwan through force if doing so is deemed necessary. </p><p>Despite PLA progress toward developing capabilities necessary for a successful invasion of Taiwan (discussed further below), Chinas military continues to have limitations in areas that suggest it is not yet ready to undertake such a high-risk operation. These limitations very likely include a lack of sealift capacity for an invasion of Taiwan, inadequate rapid runway repair capabilities to <a href="https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/CASI/Display/Article/3430623/the-regenerating-road-chinas-rapid-runway-repair-capabilities-and-other-recover/">restore</a> air operations following enemy assaults, difficulty <a href="https://digital-commons.usnwc.edu/cmsi-maritime-reports/34/">integrating</a> submarine forces into joint operations, and helicopter forces that have readiness and operational capacity limitations.

This point is debated, with some analysts focusing on Xi Jinpings <a href="https://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/research/docs/4_BoilingMoat_Ch1.pdf">warning</a> that the stormy seas of a major test are looming, his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230531131348/http://politics.people.com.cn/n1/2023/0530/c1024-40002443.html">emphasis</a> on worst-case scenario thinking, and the CCPs escalating rhetoric targeting Taiwan. However, when asked about this language during a US Congressional hearing in 2024, multiple experts from the US, India, and elsewhere <a href="https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2024-06/June_13_2024_Hearing_Transcript.pdf">assessed</a> that available evidence likely does not point to warnings of an imminent invasion specifically, but rather to the rising risks of Chinas volatile economic and geopolitical context generally (see <strong>Appendix A</strong>). In particular, these experts <a href="https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2024-06/June_13_2024_Hearing_Transcript.pdf">focus</a> on the lack of state content demonizing Chinas would-be opponents in Taiwan and likely the US. Moreover, only about 50%  at most  of the Chinese public likely supports a use of force to unify Taiwan under certain conditions; Chinas leadership would likely prefer a stronger base of popular support before initiating a high-risk and potentially costly invasion, for reasons related to PLA <a href="https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2024-06/Devin_Thorne_Testimony.pdf">reliance</a> on civilian systems  and because failure could threaten at least the current CCP leadership if not wider party legitimacy (<a href="https://digitalcommons.ndu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1118&context=strategic-forums">1</a>, <a href="https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/JIPA/Display/Article/2444775/the-day-after-the-battle/">2</a>, <a href="https://www.usip.org/publications/2024/11/many-ways-fail-costs-china-unsuccessful-taiwan-invasion">3</a>).</p><h3 id="trends-in-taiwan-and-the-us">Trends in Taiwan and the US</h3><p>Although long-term public opinion trends in Taiwan <a href="https://esc.nccu.edu.tw/PageDoc/Detail?fid=7801&id=6963">indicate</a> the majority of people are very unlikely to ever willingly support unification (discussed later in this report), polling results since 2020 likely suggest to Chinas leadership that the military and other elements of its strategy are working to curb preferences for independence in the short term. Since 2020, support for maintaining the status quo has increased while moving toward independence has trended downward (an uptick in June 2024 notwithstanding). Further, support for maintaining the status quo indefinitely has risen since 2020 from 25.8% to 33.6%. Support for &quot;independence as soon as possible has also fallen from 6.6% to 3.8% in this same period. These results likely decrease the likelihood of an invasion given Chinas very likely preference for solving domestic challenges and further preparing in case an invasion is deemed necessary.</p><p>Insikt Group has not identified any trends in the US that would, in our assessment, decrease the likelihood of invasion in the short term.</p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/ta-cn-2025-0212.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="key-takeaways---what-every-cybersecurity-expert-needs-to-know">Key Takeaways - What every cybersecurity expert needs to know</h2><p>The Space Race 2.0 is well underway and accelerating rapidly. This white paper explores the key components shaping this modern space race and highlights how cyberattacks are already influencing its trajectory. Cyber operations will play a critical role in determining who dominates the second space race. As this new race accelerates, so too will the frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks targeting organisations operating in the space domain. Understanding how cyberattacks are reshaping this race is critical to protecting global economies, military operations, and the future of national security.</p><h2 id="what-is-currently-happening">What is currently happening?</h2><p>Nation-states are swiftly adapting their militaries to compete in space, a largely unregulated domain abundant with resources. History has shown that advanced nations often exploit new frontiers, and space is no exception. With its virtually limitless resources, space has become a critical battleground.</p><p>Earths orbit is already highly contested, hosting satellites essential to global economies and military operations. Many of these satellites have been victims of cyberattacks, a trend that is certain to intensify. However, the focus extends beyond Earths ground stations and orbit, where we see espionage, destructive attacks, supply chain compromise, and signal hijacking. Nation-states are now setting their sights on deeper space, and that is where our attention must also turn.</p><h2 id="what-is-going-to-happen">What is going to happen?</h2><p>The initial stage of Space Race 2.0 centers on Earths orbit, but the Moon, asteroids, and planets hold vast resources with the potential to transform nation-states in ways we can only begin to imagine. Efforts are already underway to colonize the Moon, mine asteroids, and establish a presence on habitable worlds beyond Earth.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/convergence_01_9b26a1d4c5.jpg" alt="Stages of the space race"><em><strong>Figure 1</strong>: Stages of the space race that are unfolding.</em> </p><p>As these ambitions grow, so will efforts to outmaneuver rival nations. Cyber capabilities will play a critical role, as adversaries seek to steal information or disrupt operations. Ground stations, communication signals, and the supply chains supporting space assets are vulnerable to cyberattacks. As such, space-related organisations and companies must prioritize robust cybersecurity measures to protect their operations in this emerging domain. At an operational level, researchers are advancing frameworks like SPARTA to stay ahead of evolving tactics, techniques, and procedures</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/convergence_02_adb7eeb826.png" alt="Space Attack Research &amp; Tactic Analysis"><em><strong>Figure 2</strong>: Space Attack Research &amp; Tactic Analysis (SPARTA) from <a href="https://sparta.aerospace.org/">https://sparta.aerospace.org/</a>.</em></p><p>At the strategic level, industry and government are convening more frequently at conferences like Defence Space 24 to address the growing cyber threats in the space domain.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/convergence_03_ff07053458.png" alt="Defence Space 24"><em><strong>Figure 3</strong>: Defence Space 24 was hosted in London at the end of September 2024. Government, military, and industry representatives attended the event.</em></p><p>At a nation-state level, militaries are increasingly integrating intelligence and cyber capabilities into their space operations, with U.S. Space Command serving as a prominent example.</p><p>ConclusionThis white paper explores the intersection of space exploration and cybersecurity, delving into the challenges and opportunities shaping this evolving frontier. The stakes could not be higher: dominance in cyberspace directly translates to dominance in outer space, where control will determine humanitys future trajectory beyond Earth. As such, the convergence of space and cyber is critical and demands our full attention.</p>]]></content:encoded>

TAG-124 comprises a network of compromised WordPress sites, actor-controlled payload servers, a central server, a suspected management server, an additional panel, and other components. The threat actors behind TAG-124 demonstrate high levels of activity, including regularly updating URLs embedded in the compromised WordPress sites, adding servers, refining TDS logic to evade detection, and adapting infection tactics, as demonstrated by their recent implementation of the ClickFix technique. </p><p>Insikt Group identified multiple threat actors using TAG-124 within their initial infection chains, including operators of Rhysida ransomware, Interlock ransomware, TA866/Asylum Ambuscade, SocGholish, D3F@CK Loader, TA582, and others. Notably, the shared use of TAG-124 reinforces the <a href="https://blog.talosintelligence.com/emerging-interlock-ransomware/">connection</a> between Rhysida and Interlock ransomware, which are already linked through similarities in tactics, tools, encryption behaviors, ransom note themes, code overlaps, and data exfiltration techniques. Insikt Group expects that TAG-124 will continue its operations within the increasingly sophisticated and specialized cybercriminal ecosystem, enhance its effectiveness, and attract additional users and partners.</p><h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2><ul><li>Insikt Group identified multi-layered infrastructure linked to a TDS tracked as TAG-124.

A TDS typically <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/White-paper-Ransomware-extortion-and-the-cyber-crime-ecosystem.pdf">refers</a> to a system used to analyze and redirect web traffic based on parameters like geolocation or device type, funneling only specific visitors to malicious destinations such as phishing sites, malware, or exploit kits, while evading detection and optimizing cybercriminal campaigns. </p><p>More specifically, TAG-124 operates by injecting malicious JavaScript code into compromised WordPress websites. When visitors access an infected website, they unknowingly load attacker-controlled resources designed to manipulate them into completing actions that result in the download and execution of malware. TAG-124 often deceives victims by presenting the malware as a required Google Chrome browser update. </p><p>In more recent variations, TAG-124 has been <a href="https://malasada.tech/updated-landupdate808-analysis/">observed</a> using the ClickFix technique. This approach displays a dialog instructing visitors to execute a command pre-copied to their clipboard. Once a visitor runs the command, it initiates a multi-stage process that downloads and executes the malware payload.</p><h2 id="threat-analysis">Threat Analysis</h2><h3 id="tag-124">TAG-124</h3><p>Insikt Group identified multi-layered infrastructure associated with the TDS TAG-124. This infrastructure comprises a network of compromised WordPress sites, likely actor-controlled payload servers, a central server whose exact purpose remains unclear at the time of analysis, a suspected management server, and an additional management panel. If visitors fulfill specific criteria, the compromised WordPress websites display fake Google Chrome update landing pages, which ultimately lead to malware infections as discussed in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sWVPIS7aEW2Z8Mva1mmWB2auMGlWKGfmUggwZVKuL88/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.gfx3d1cfkcni">Users of TAG-124</a> section of this report (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>).</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/tag_124_001_13e664d086.png" alt="TAG-124s high-level infrastructure setup"><em><strong>Figure 1</strong>: TAG-124s high-level infrastructure setup (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><h4 id="compromised-wordpress-websites">Compromised WordPress Websites</h4><p>TAG-124s infrastructure consists of an extensive network of WordPress websites (see <strong>Appendix A</strong>). These websites appear to lack a consistent theme regarding industry, topic, or geography, suggesting they were likely compromised opportunistically through exploits or by acquiring credentials, such as those obtained via infostealers.</p><h5 id="first-stage-wordpress-websites-in-initial-delivery">First-Stage WordPress Websites in Initial Delivery</h5><p>The compromised websites of the first stage in the initial delivery phase typically include a <span style="font-family: Courier;">script</span> tag with an <span style="font-family: Courier;">async</span> attribute at an arbitrary location in the document object model (DOM), enabling the loading of an external JavaScript file in parallel with the page to avoid rendering delays (see <strong>Figure 2</strong>).</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/tag_124_002_34e39e0a75.png" alt="Script tag in DOM used to load external JavaScript file"><em><strong>Figure 2</strong>: Script tag in DOM used to load external JavaScript file (Source: <a href="https://urlscan.io/result/eaa33803-1435-44c9-949f-3d707f51da4a">URLScan</a>)</em></p><p>The JavaScript filename has changed frequently over time, with earlier names following recognizable patterns (such as <span style="font-family: Courier;">metrics.js</span>) and more recent ones <a href="https://threatfox.abuse.ch/ioc/1353344/">appearing</a> to be randomly formatted (such as <span style="font-family: Courier;">hpms1989.js</span>).

For instance, the website associated with <em>www[.]ecowas[.]int</em> has consistently changed the URL used to fetch the JavaScript file. This behavior indicates that the threat actors maintain ongoing access to these WordPress sites and frequently alter the URLs, including the domain and JavaScript filename, likely to evade detection.</p><p>Although many of the compromised WordPress websites appear to be associated with lesser-known organizations, Insikt Group identified notable cases, including a subdomain linked to the Polish Centre for Testing and Certification, <em>www[.]pcbc[.]gov[.]pl</em>, and the domain of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) (<em>www[.]ecowas[.]int</em>). Both have been compromised and used in TAG-124 campaigns.</p><h5 id="final-stage-wordpress-websites-in-initial-delivery">Final Stage WordPress Websites in Initial Delivery</h5><p>If visitors meet specific criteria, which could not be fully determined, the compromised WordPress domains typically present fake Google Chrome update landing pages.

TAG-124 delivery servers (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p><p>Most of the domains began resolving in November 2024, suggesting that TAG-124 gained momentum during this period, with the majority of the domains still active at the time of analysis. Of note, two domains hosted on <em>45[.]61[.]136[.]67</em>, namely <em>piedsmontlaw[.]com</em> and <em>pemalite[.]com</em>, were already resolving to this IP address in 2022, indicating that the server may have already been under the control of the threat actor during that time.</p><h5 id="suspected-higher-tier-infrastructure">Suspected Higher-Tier Infrastructure</h5><p>The majority of the suspected threat actor-controlled TAG-124 delivery servers, as listed in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sWVPIS7aEW2Z8Mva1mmWB2auMGlWKGfmUggwZVKuL88/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.78m3kdx91knq">TAG-124 Delivery Servers</a> section, have been seen communicating with a server over TCP port 443 (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>). The configurations of this server are similar to those of the delivery servers and host a domain that returns only a generic HTML page when accessed. At the time of analysis, Insikt Group could not determine the exact purpose of this server but suspects it plays a central role in the operation. One possibility is that it contains the core logic of the TDS.</p><p>Additionally, Insikt Group identified a suspected management server linked to TAG-124. This server has been observed communicating with the delivery servers via TCP ports 80 and 443. It has also interacted with another panel linked to TAG-124, referred to as the &quot;Ads Panel&quot;, whose purpose includes serving the latest delivery server through a specified endpoint, among others (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>).</p><h2>Appendix A  Indicators of Compromise</h2><table><tbody><tr><td style="font-family:Courier New;background-color:#fff"><strong>Likely Compromised WordPress

            <description><![CDATA[Discover key insights from Recorded Future's 2024 report on cyber threats, criminal networks, SaaS identity risks, and strategies for 2025 cybersecurity.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png"></p><h2 id="explore-our-2024-threat-analysis-and-2025-predictions">Explore our 2024 Threat Analysis and 2025 Predictions</h2><p>In 2024, two key trends defined the cybersecurity landscape: the resilience of cybercriminal networks despite law enforcement actions and the growing complexity of enterprise attack surfaces. In addition, state-sponsored threat actors, primarily linked to China and Russia, intensified their focus on critical infrastructure and leveraged generative AI to conduct influence operations to advance their geopolitical objectives.</p><p>Recorded Futures just-released threat report explores these trends and more. It presents the industrys most comprehensive analysis of intelligence from 2024 as well as predictions to prepare your security organization for the year ahead. </p><p>Read on for a summary of key topics and themes, and then <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2025-0128.pdf">download the full report</a> for an in-depth look at the adversarys TTPs so you can strengthen your security posture.  </p><h3 id="top-themes-from-our-2024-research">Top Themes from our 2024 Research</h3><p><strong>Theme #1: Extortion Groups Proliferated Despite Law Enforcement Action</strong></p><p>Despite significant global law enforcement efforts targeting ransomware groups like <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/lockbit-launches-ransomware-blog">LockBit</a> and <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/latin-american-governments-targeted-by-ransomware">ALPHV</a>, cybercriminals demonstrated their ability to adapt and thrive. They reorganized, leveraged leaked malware builders, and shifted to smaller, independent groups. By mid-2024, ransomware payments had already reached $459.8 million, with a record $75 million paid by a single victim. </p><p><strong>Theme #2: Growing Adoption of SaaS Led to More Identity Exploits</strong></p><p>Organizations now use an average of 371 SaaS applications, up significantly from 2021, with each application requiring its own access credentials. This increase in SaaS reliance gave threat actors more opportunities to exploit stolen or exposed credentials, which were implicated in high-profile breaches such as those at Snowflake and Change Healthcare. In both cases, attackers used stolen credentials obtained through infostealer malware to bypass single sign-on (SSO) protections. </p><p><strong>Theme #3: State-sponsored Influence Operations Escalated</strong></p><p>State-sponsored threat actors, including those <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/from-coercion-to-invasion-the-theory-and-execution-of-china-cyber-activity">linked to China</a>, Russia, and Iran, escalated their activities in 2024. These operations targeted critical infrastructure and leveraged generative AI to conduct influence campaigns during key elections.</p><p>Chinas Volt Typhoon group pre-positioned itself in US critical infrastructure, raising concerns about its potential for strategically timed cyberattacks. Meanwhile, Russia and Iran used generative AI to accelerate the creation and dissemination of inauthentic content aimed at influencing public opinion and destabilizing democracies worldwide. </p><p><strong>Theme #4: Tactics and Techniques Emphasized Defense Evasion</strong></p><p>Threat actors increasingly employed advanced tactics to evade detection. Malware targeting macOS and Linux systems surged, reflecting the growing use of these platforms in enterprise environments. Tools like RustDoor and <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/the-travels-of-markopolo-self-proclaimed-meeting-software-vortax-spreads-infostealers">AMOS</a> exploited cross-platform functionality to deliver sophisticated payloads, while ransomware groups targeted critical hypervisors such as VMware ESXi.</p><p>Defense evasion techniques, such as reflective code loading and the abuse of remote monitoring tools, became more prevalent. These methods enabled attackers to bypass endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions.</p><h3 id="top-insikt-group-predictions-for-2025">Top Insikt Group Predictions for 2025</h3><p><strong>#1: AI Impersonation will be the Next Big Attack Vector for SaaS Applications</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/insikt-group">Insikt Group</a> expects that a major breach will very likely result from one of two AI-associated factors: implementation of generative AI into enterprise workflows or abuse of AI for effective impersonation. In either case, it is likely that a SaaS application will play a role in initial access or data exposure.</p><p><strong>#2: Additional Typhoon Activity will Affect New Sectors</strong></p><p>Insikt Group predicts that more high-profile breaches of US critical infrastructure by <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/chinese-apt-groups-target-afghan-telecommunications-firm">China-linked APTs</a> will be disclosed in 2025, expanding beyond the energy and telecommunications sectors. These breaches are likely aimed at pre-positioning for disruptive operations.</p><p><strong>#3: macOS and Mobile Threats Join Windows and Cloud</strong></p><p>Insikt Group forecasts that one of the high-impact cyber incidents of 2025 will likely be associated with either macOS malware or mobile malware. This will result from certain environmental factors reaching breaking points, such as higher attention to macOS targets and increased access to sensitive corporate and financial data via mobile devices.</p><p><strong>#4: Crypto Fraud Will Lead to a Market-destabilizing Event</strong></p><p>The soaring value of cryptocurrency, as well as an incoming US administration set to pursue crypto-friendly policies, will drive more aggressive and ambitious fraud attempts. Inskit Group predicts that criminals will likely be emboldened by the crypto boom to carry out market-destabilizing scams that will at least temporarily reduce the value of cryptocurrencies and lead to calls to restrict their use.</p><h3 id="get-the-2024-recorded-future-annual-report-today">Get the 2024 Recorded Future Annual Report Today</h3><p>Download the report to access the complete set of research themes and predictions plus detailed analysis.

Scam e-commerce and dark web card validation activities also saw notable increases, reflecting growing sophistication among threat actors.</p><p>Emerging trends indicate fraudsters increasing exploitation of modern payment technologies and social engineering to <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2022-0726.pdf">bypass anti-fraud measures</a>. Predictions for 2025 include a rise in digital e-skimming and scam e-commerce, continued activity on dark web marketplaces, and persistent check fraud in the United States. The report emphasizes the need for financial institutions, merchants, and payment providers to adopt fusion intelligence strategies and rigorous verification processes to combat fraud effectively.</p><h2 id="key-highlights-from-2024">Key Highlights from 2024</h2><h3 id="surge-in-stolen-data">Surge in Stolen Data</h3><p>In 2024, 269 million card records and 1.9 million stolen US bank checks were posted on dark and clear web platforms. This surge reflects a combination of increased data compromise events and rampant reposting. Notably, card-not-present (CNP) data dominated, signaling the growing impact of e-commerce fraud.</p><h3 id="magecart-e-skimmer-infections">Magecart E-Skimmer Infections</h3><p>The volume of Magecart e-skimmer infections surged, reaching nearly 11,000 unique e-commerce domainsa threefold increase from 2023. This spike was driven by the CosmicSting vulnerability (CVE-2024-34102), alongside the use of out-of-the-box e-skimmer kits like <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/h1-2024-malware-and-vulnerability-trends-report">Sniffer by Fleras</a>. </p><h3 id="scam-e-commerce-websites">Scam E-Commerce Websites</h3><p>Nearly 1,200 scam domains were linked to fraudulent merchant accounts, with most registered in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong. Operators of these scams leveraged social engineering tactics and linked merchant accounts to defraud victims and monetize stolen data.</p><h3 id="dark-web-activity">Dark Web Activity</h3><p><a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/improving-dark-web-investigations-with-threat-intelligence">Dark web</a> marketplaces remained central to the fraud ecosystem, offering stolen card data and facilitating fraud workflows. Telegram, despite recent disruptions, continued to be a source of unique fraud data.</p><h2 id="trends-to-watch-in-2025">Trends to Watch in 2025</h2><h3 id="digital-e-skimming-and-scam-e-commerce">Digital E-Skimming and Scam E-Commerce</h3><p>Fraudsters will increasingly target e-commerce platforms using advanced e-skimmer tactics and <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/scam-websites-take-advantage-of-seasonal-openings">scam websites</a>. The adoption of digital wallets will further expose vulnerabilities in payment ecosystems, particularly through OTP interception techniques.</p><h3 id="dark-web-marketplaces">Dark Web Marketplaces</h3><p>Despite law enforcement efforts, <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/dark-web-threats">dark web marketplaces</a> will continue to thrive, offering anonymity and scalability.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png"></p><h2 id="summary">Summary:</h2><p>Between July 2023 and December 2024, Insikt Group observed the Chinese state-sponsored group RedDelta targeting Mongolia, Taiwan, Myanmar, Vietnam, and Cambodia with an adapted infection chain to distribute its customized PlugX backdoor. The group used lure documents themed around the 2024 Taiwanese presidential candidate Terry Gou, the Vietnamese National Holiday, flood protection in Mongolia, and meeting invitations, including an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) meeting. RedDelta likely compromised the Mongolian Ministry of Defense in August 2024 and the Communist Party of Vietnam in November 2024. The group conducted spearphishing targeting the Vietnamese Ministry of Public Security, but Insikt Group observed no evidence of  successful compromise. From September to December 2024, RedDelta likely targeted victims in Malaysia, Japan, the United States, Ethiopia, Brazil, Australia, and India.</p><p>In late 2023, RedDelta evolved the first stage of its infection chain to leverage a Windows Shortcut (LNK) file likely delivered via spearphishing. In 2024, the group transitioned to using Microsoft Management Console Snap-In Control (MSC) files. Most recently, RedDelta used spearphishing links to prompt a victim to load an HTML file remotely hosted on Microsoft Azure. Since July 2023, RedDelta has consistently used the Cloudflare content distribution network (CDN) to proxy command-and-control (C2) traffic, which enables the group to blend in with legitimate CDN traffic and complicates victim identification. Other state-sponsored groups, including Russias BlueAlpha, have similarly leveraged Cloudflare to evade detection.</p><p>RedDeltas activities align with Chinese strategic priorities, focusing on governments and diplomatic organizations in Southeast Asia, Mongolia, and Europe. The groups Asia-focused targeting in 2023 and 2024 represents a return to the groups historical focus after targeting European organizations in 2022. RedDeltas targeting of Mongolia and Taiwan is consistent with the groups past targeting of groups seen as threats to the Chinese Communist Partys power.</p><h2 id="about-reddelta">About RedDelta:</h2><p>RedDelta has been active since at least 2012 and has focused on targeting Southeast Asia and Mongolia. The group has routinely adapted its targeting in response to global geopolitical events. <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/reddelta-targets-catholic-organizations">RedDelta targeted the Vatican and other Catholic organizations</a> with PlugX before 2021 talks between China  and the Vatican. The has group <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/reddelta-cyber-threat-operations">compromised</a> law enforcement and government entities in India, a government organization in Indonesia, and other targets across Myanmar, Hong Kong, and Australia.</p><p>In 2022, <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/reddelta-targets-european-government-organizations-continues-iterate-custom-plugx-variant">RedDelta shifted toward increased targeting of European government and diplomatic entities</a> following Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine. This activity used an infection chain that began by delivering an archive file (ZIP, RAR, or ISO), which was likely delivered via spearphishing. The file contained a Windows Shortcut (LNK) file disguised with a double extension (such as .doc.lnk) and a Microsoft Word icon. Hidden folders within the archive contained three files used to complete dynamic-link library (DLL) search order hijacking: a legitimate binary, a malicious DLL loader, and an encrypted PlugX payload that was ultimately loaded into memory. User execution of the Shortcut file led to DLL search order hijacking. In November 2022, RedDelta evolved its tactics to stage the ISO file on a threat actor-controlled domain.</p><p>In March 2023, Insikt Group identified RedDelta targeting Mongolia using a similar infection chain that started with a container file (RAR, ZIP, ISO) consisting of an LNK file that triggered a DLL search order hijacking triad located within a hidden nested subdirectory. Decoy documents included an invitation from the World Association of Mongolia and a document claiming to be a BBC news interview about Tibetan Buddhism and Mongolia. RedDelta targeted: </p><ul><li>Members of multiple Mongolian non-governmental organizations (NGOs), including a human rights and pro-democracy NGO focused on the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region</li><li>Mongolian Buddhist activists in Mongolia and Japan</li><li>Academic professionals in Mongolia and Japan</li><li>Developers of two Mongolian mobile applications</li></ul><h2 id="mitigations">Mitigations:</h2><p>To detect and mitigate RedDelta activity, organizations should:</p><ul><li>Use YARA and Sigma rules provided by Insikt Group to detect RedDelta Windows Installer (MSI), DLL, and LNK files (see below).</li><li>Configure intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), and other network defense mechanisms to alert on or block connection attempts from external IP addresses and domains associated with RedDelta (see below).</li><li>Keep software and applications  particularly operating systems, antivirus software, and core system utilities  up to date.</li><li>Filter email correspondence and scrutinize attachments for malware.</li><li>Conduct regular system backups and store them offline and offsite to ensure they are inaccessible via the network.</li><li>Adhere to strict compartmentalization of company-sensitive data, institute role-based access, and limit company-wide data access.</li><li>Deploy client-based host logging and intrusion detection capabilities to identify and thwart attacks early.</li><li>Prevent threat actors from bypassing security by disabling outdated authentication methods.</li><li>Implement tools like network IDS, NetFlow collection, host logging, and web proxy, alongside manual monitoring of detection sources.</li><li>Practice network segmentation and ensure special protections exist for sensitive information, such as multifactor authentication, and restricted accesss.</li></ul><p>Leverage the <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/third-party-intelligence">Recorded Future Third-Party Intelligence module</a> and <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform/browser-extension">Threat Intelligence Browser Extension</a> for real-time monitoring and prioritized vulnerability patching.</p><p>Review public guidance (<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-158a">1</a>, <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-144a">2</a>, <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2019/Oct/07/2002191601/-1/-1/0/Mitigating%20Recent%20VPN%20Vulnerabilities%20-%20Copy.pdf">3</a>, <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa20-258a">4</a>) and Insikt Groups <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/charting-chinas-climb-leading-global-cyber-power">Charting Chinas Climb as a Leading Global Cyber Power</a> report for comprehensive recommendations for mitigating Chinese advanced persistent threat activity more broadly.</p><h2 id="outlook">Outlook:</h2><p>Insikt Group anticipates that RedDelta will continue targeting organizations worldwide with its customized PlugX backdoor, focusing on Southeast Asia and Chinas periphery, including Mongolia and Taiwan. Likely targets include governments, NGOs, activists, and religious organizations. RedDelta has continually evolved its infection chain and is anticipated to continue doing so in the future in response to major geopolitical developments.</p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a

            <description><![CDATA[A new report by Recorded Future’s Insikt group finds that countries across Central Asia and Latin America are increasingly basing their digital surveillance practices on Russia's System for Operative Investigative Activities (SORM).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png"></p><h2 id="summary">Summary:</h2><p>Several countries in Central Asia and Latin America almost certainly base their digital surveillance capabilities on Russias System for Operative Investigative Activities (SORM), indicating that Russian surveillance technology has proliferated in Russias near abroad and among its allies. Insikt Group identified evidence of at least eight SORM providers exporting to these regions, with at least fifteen telecommunications companies as likely customers. The largest Russian SORM providers like Citadel, Norsi-Trans, and Protei, export and participate in trade expositions across Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East, highlighting efforts to further expand globally. While these systems have legitimate security applications, the governments outlined in this report have a history of misusing surveillance capabilities , including repression of political opposition, journalists, and activists, without effective or independent oversight. SORM facilitates interception of a wide range of internet and telecommunications traffic by authorities without the knowledge of the service providers themselves, reducing transparency and oversight of surveillance operations and increasing opportunities for abuse. Companies operating in or looking to establish physical operations in these countries should assess surveillance risks and adopt privacy tools like encryption and VPNs  to the extent permitted by local law  to mitigate sensitive communications being intercepted.</p><h2 id="what-is-sorm">What is SORM?</h2><p><a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/russia-ukraine-cyber-front">Russias SORM</a> underpins the <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2021-0909.pdf">Russian Federations electronic surveillance apparatus</a>, which involves all telecommunications and ISP companies installing monitoring equipment under strict government oversight. Security and intelligence services gain direct access to telecommunications traffic passing through the installed equipment, bypassing service providers, who are not authorized to access information regarding interceptions. SORM has evolved from intercepting landline and mobile communications to monitoring internet traffic, Wi-Fi, and social media, with the latest iteration (SORM-3) enabling the collection and long-term storage of traffic and subscriber metadata in a searchable database. This system allows law enforcement authorities and security services to filter data by identifiers such as phone numbers, geolocations, IP addresses, and usernames, all supported by legal frameworks mandating compliance. The nature of SORMs integration into telecommunications and internet infrastructure facilitates potential interception and reduces visibility into surveillance operations, raising the risk of abuse, especially in countries with limited or nonexistent oversight.</p><h2 id="risk-of-russian-government-access">Risk of Russian Government Access</h2><p>Foreign deployments of SORM-based surveillance systems using Russian-manufactured components likely entail a risk of Russian access, given the close ties between SORM providers and the Russian government and the likely high value of information intercepted via these systems. Previous cases, such as the suspected exploitation of Kaspersky exports, support the assessment that Moscow can likely access exported SORM technologies. In <a href="https://www.bis.gov/press-release/commerce-department-prohibits-russian-kaspersky-software-us-customers">June 2024</a>, the US Department of Commerces Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) prohibited Kaspersky Lab from providing technologies and services in the US or to US persons, citing several factors of &quot;unacceptable&quot; risk to national security. Similar concerns apply to SORM providers, such as Citadel, which has been tied to Russian security services, specifically the Federal Security Service (FSB), and oligarchs close to President Vladimir Putin. Citadels major role in the consolidation of the Russian SORM market also underscores likely connections to the Russian government. Notably, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan have raised concerns about backdoors in SORM equipment, with evidence suggesting that Russian manufacturers maintained access to systems deployed abroad.</p><h2 id="mitigations">Mitigations</h2><p>Companies operating in countries using SORM-based systems should mitigate the risk of interception by securing online communications with reputable encryption tools, avoiding services on hosting providers with top-level domains of these countries, limiting or removing access to sensitive corporate data during travel, and conducting comprehensive assessments of state digital and physical surveillance capabilities, focusing on evidence of malign misuse against business travelers.</p><p>In this report, Insikt Group has provided a list of indicators that companies can use to assess data privacy and surveillance risk in the context of SORM. While none of these factors guarantee a country uses SORM, the presence of several indicators is indicative of a higher state surveillance risk, including imports from known Russian SORM providers, legislation requiring the installation of interception technologies akin to SORM, joint telecommunications projects with Russian SORM providers, state control over telecommunications infrastructure, reports of intrusive or malign surveillance, and restrictions on encryption technologies. <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/geopolitical-intelligence">Recorded Futures Country Risk feature</a> offers regularly updated analysis and mitigation guidance for assessing such risks.</p><h2 id="outlook">Outlook</h2><p>The marketing materials and trade show participation of major SORM providers suggest that these organizations will very likely continue to seek opportunities for foreign expansion. Countries with close ties to Russia  especially those with histories of cybersecurity or intelligence cooperation or joint projects in the telecommunications sphere  will likely continue to source digital surveillance components from Russian providers. SORM deployments in these regions will almost certainly continue to present data security risks, particularly where oversight of government surveillance is weak. More broadly, the export of Russian surveillance technologies will continue to offer Moscow opportunities to expand its influence, particularly in its &quot;near abroad&quot;, and potentially enhance intelligence collection capabilities, though the degree of potential access is unclear.</p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/ta-ru-2025-0107.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year, our Hispanic Heritage Month program features a three-part series led by <a href="https://notainclusion.com/">Nota Inclusion</a> speakers. Futurists are invited to participate in virtual development sessions covering themes like overcoming adversity, unlocking personal potential, and harnessing the power of connection.</p><p><a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/erg-stories-hispanic-heritage-month-2024">In part one</a>, Mando Origel, Recorded Futures Latin Network ERG lead and Customer Success Manager, shared his inspiration for organizing these events and what he felt was the most important part of the ERG work: making meaningful connections. </p><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/0pcwi2fsf2.jsonp" async></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script><div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;"><div class="wistia_embed wistia_async_0pcwi2fsf2 seo=true videoFoam=true" style="height:100%;position:relative;width:100%"><div class="wistia_swatch" style="height:100%;left:0;opacity:0;overflow:hidden;position:absolute;top:0;transition:opacity 200ms;width:100%;"><img src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/0pcwi2fsf2/swatch" style="filter:blur(5px);height:100%;object-fit:contain;width:100%;" alt="" aria-hidden="true" onload="this.parentNode.style.opacity=1;" /></div></div></div></div><p><em>Transcript: When you share your story, a lot of people can identify with it. And therefore, you know, you break that barrier of fear thats behind being authentically you. Hopefully, thats been the results, you know, where people can feel like they can be authentic at work, where they can bring their culture, their traditions, and really help everybody learn about one another. When people feel like they belong, theyre more willing to be themselves. And when youre yourself, you bring that authenticity which spreads like wildfire.</em></p><p>This November, Futurists completed part two of the series - a practical and interactive session where they reflected on their paths, feelings, and vision for their year to come through that same notion and concept of authenticity and connection.</p><p>We talked to them to understand their experiences and takeaways following the Creating Your Limitless Life workshop! </p><p>I found the Collective Power event to be a valuable opportunity to share and learn practical strategies for life management. Hearing about the positive goals others have set was inspiring, and it was encouraging to explore new approaches to achieve those goals. Overall, the experience was both enlightening and up-lifting. - Peter Barry, Office Operations Coordinator - Somerville</p><p>The Collective Power series was the most impactful self-reflection exercise I&#39;ve had the privilege to experience. The facilitators were awesome in sparking conversations where we felt comfortable sharing both personal and professional development ideas. I now have a true understanding of what I accomplished in 2024, and manageable expectations for myself and others in 2025. - Kim Stone, Sr. Program Manager, Customer Success</p><p>I found the Collective Power series to be empowering and enabling. It was reassuring to meet with other coworkers who are dealing with obstacles that life throws at them and hearing how everyone is coping and thriving despite those challenges. I learned resilience techniques and felt encouraged and less alone as a result. It was a great way to connect on a human level with my coworkers. - Charity Wright, Principal Threat Intelligence Consultant</p><p>Stay tuned for the third and final part of this series in 2025.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Editor&#39;s note: The following blog post originally appeared on <a href="https://intelligence2risk.substack.com/">Levi Gundert&#39;s Substack page</a>.</strong></em></p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/fraud_funding_image4_21003de229.png" alt="fraud-funding-image4.png"></p><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>A past conversation with an undercover federal agent who specializes in money laundering revealed staggering amounts of currency moving across geographic boundaries, skirting traditional Anti-Money Laundering (AML) processes. From local and transnational crime syndicates to presidential spouses and those looking to evade sanctions or tax regimes, the need to wash and move illicit funds into reputable banking channels has never been greater. </p><p>The FTs recent AML coverage highlights the scale of the problem and provides timely <a href="https://www.ft.com/search?q=money+laundering">background reading</a> on money laundering networks, suspects, and indictments. One <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/db1fa3d5-ebe7-4612-b8b2-d4ea3f1e1027">story</a> is particularly relevant as it centers around proof of address compliance failures. Coincidentally, address verification is precisely the problem highlighted by a recent Recorded Future Payment Fraud Intelligence (PFI) report.</p><h2 id="big-fraud-and-a-hong-kong-address">Big Fraud and a Hong Kong Address</h2><p>The address in question is:<em>12th Floor, San Toi Building,137-139</em><em>Connaught Road Central, Hong Kong</em></p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/fraud_funding_image2_2e86532b3d.png" alt="fraud-funding-image2.png"><em>The San Toi Building (and 12th-floor visual estimate) provided by Google Maps</em></p><p>The address is linked to two scam website (fraud) clustersdesignated Misspelled and Brand as a Coverwhich share merchant accounts and payment processing logic. The three merchant accounts include CAMHUBSTORE, AQAPAY*xmvmxft, SMARTTECHHK, and gracefashionhub. Hundreds, if not thousands, of scam websites are connected to these merchants.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/fraud_funding_image1_68d61a2cfe.jpg" alt="fraud-funding-image1.jpg"><em>A scam website snapshot.</em> </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/fraud_funding_image5_2cdfd29303.jpg" alt="fraud-funding-image5.jpg"><em>A victim articulates why Camhubstore is a scam site.</em> </p><p>These merchant accounts that process payments for fraudulent, non-existent goods are tied to the 12th floor of the San Toi Building as the registered business address. The address is even placed directly on some of the sites as a contact address. Heres where it gets interesting. The address is listed on the <a href="https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id=46352">U.S. Treasury OFAC list</a> for ties to an <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1932">Iranian terrorism group</a>. </p><p>The 12th floor is presumably large enough to house <a href="https://www.importyeti.com/supplier/fenglong-art">multiple businesses</a> and likely sufficiently small such that <a href="https://www.importyeti.com/addresses/supplier/12-f-san-toi-building-137-139-connaught-road-central">businesses transit through</a> reasonably often. Of course, it would be difficult to draw a direct connection between these merchant accounts and terrorism based on a shared space address. Still, other questions remain, namely: how are these scam merchants acquiring the ability to process payment cards when their physical address is on the OFAC list? </p><h2 id="remedying-aml--kyc-compliance-failures">Remedying AML / KYC Compliance Failures</h2><p>Knowing your customer (KYC) might be difficult when bad actors go to great lengths to obscure their identity and purpose, but this is an egregious case of acquiring banks and payment processors missing obviously <a href="https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/nodes/292373?e=true">problematic</a> contact details.</p><p>Geoff Whites book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lazarus-Heist-Based-hit-podcast/dp/0241554276/"><em>The Lazarus Heist</em>, documented that even routine checks can lead to better outcomes</a>. In it, White details North Korean hackers&#39; inability to transfer a more significant amount (hundreds of millions of dollars) from Bangladesh Bank to a bank branch in Manila because the branch is located on Jupiter Street, and &quot;Jupiter is also the name of a sanctioned Iranian shipping vessel. Addresses matter. </p><p>Suppose the US <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/crypto-banks-relationship-trump-administration-414ff706">pursues a more friendly regulatory environment</a> for cryptocurrencies under President Trump, and exchanges find it easier to acquire bank accounts. In that case, the <a href="https://intelligence2risk.substack.com/p/from-crypto-to-fiat-sneaky-ways-cybercriminals">potential for money laundering</a> may explode without rigorous AML / KYC / KYT efforts. The SEC may have fewer teeth, but banks and processors are still gambling if anyone can obtain a merchant account with little to no compliance checks. </p><p>Indeed, the business incentives are aligned to offer maximum merchant accounts to generate more processing fees, and historically, compliance costs have eroded profitability. However, this may be an emerging opportunity for GenAI. Semi-autonomous agents trained to flag basic AML violations (for example, website contact details listed on OFAC, perhaps) and elastic agents that deploy on demand when a new merchant application is submitted would assist AML compliance efforts and help the financial services industry grappling with a tsunami of fraudulent merchant transactions. </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/fraud_funding_image3_c710d76671.png" alt="fraud-funding-image3.png"></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Discover the rising costs of data breaches, including disruption, legal risks, and lost trust. Learn proactive steps to protect your business from escalating threats.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recorded Futures Insikt Group identified a 76% increase in publicly reported data breaches from 2022 to 2023. While 2024 data is not yet complete, Recorded Future data on validated data breaches project a further 5% increase in 2024 compared to 2023. The scale of this increase in the past two years invites a sense of urgency and concern, especially when the attack surface for data breaches is moving further out of companies control. Based on what we can measure, the costliest impacts of data breaches in the last several years have been operational disruption, legal risks, and declining sales due to churn and loss of customer trust. However, the real risk lies in companies falling behind in their security strategy and failing to adopt a new way of thinking. Our immediate and long-term solutions provide a starting point for effectively addressing this escalating threat. </p><h2 id="data-breaches-are-on-the-rise">Data Breaches Are on the Rise</h2><ul><li>The industries most affected by the 76% increase in data breaches in 2023 were the healthcare, finance, information technology and software, insurance, and manufacturing sectors.</li><li>The insurance sector saw the largest increase in reported data breaches in 2023, with a 178% increase. This was followed by healthcare with a 107% increase and manufacturing with an 81% increase. The sensitivity of these industries data and the cost of disruption to their operations have likely been driving factors for threat actors to target these industries.</li></ul><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/data_breaches_chart_b8e601b5a0.png" alt="Figure 1: Publicly reported data breaches in the top five affected industries In 2022 compared to 2023 (Source: Recorded Future)"><em>Figure 1: Publicly reported data breaches in the top five affected industries In 2022 compared to 2023 (Source: Recorded <a href="https://app.recordedfuture.com/live/sc/1ObI7GMg9WD3">Future</a>)</em></p><h2 id="the-costs-of-data-breaches-continue-to-be-high">The Costs of Data Breaches Continue to be High</h2><ul><li>Research from <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">IBM shows</a> that the average total cost of a data breach reached an all-time high in 2024 of USD 4.88 million. </li><li>The business impacts of data breaches are often easiest to measure right after a breach is detected, such as the four-day outage at an Australian personal loan provider in early 2023 that <a href="https://investors.latitudefinancial.com.au/DownloadFile.axd?file=/Report/ComNews/20230316/02644401.pdf">resulted</a> in what we estimate could have been a revenue disruption of over $6 million USD while security teams mitigated the breach. </li><li>However, impacts can also linger: In Q4 of 2023, after a US genetics testing company confirmed it had been hit by a major data breach, it saw <a href="https://investors.23andme.com/news-releases/news-release-details/23andme-reports-fy2023-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-financial">decreased sales</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/.IXIC:INDEXNASDAQ?window=1Y&comparison=NASDAQ%3AME">underperformed</a> the Nasdaq by approximately 16%. While it was not the only factor at play, the negative media coverage around the data breach is highly likely to have played a role in stock, sales, and revenue underperformance, especially when considered in the context of the <a href="https://connect.sustainalytics.com/hubfs/INV/Thought%20Leadership/Sustainalytics_The%20Impact%20of%20Cyberattacks%20on%20Stock%20Prices_Sep%202022.pdf">extensive</a> <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">literature indicating</a> how cyberattacks can negatively impact stock prices.</li></ul><h2 id="the-causes-are-moving-further-out-of-control">The Causes Are Moving Further Out Of Control</h2><ul><li>As the costs of a data breach increase, the causes of breaches are also moving further out of organizations control. Companies may have robust vulnerability remediation on their infrastructure and devices, but threat actors are increasingly looking for vulnerabilities in third-party software to gain access to more potential victims1. Third-party software providers are critical components of the software supply chain and may not have effectively identified or addressed these vulnerabilities. This lack of remediation exposes the entire ecosystem to heightened risks of compromise, as reliance on <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/outcomes/supply-chain">third-party software expands the attack surface</a>.</li><li>As more and more data is likely hosted on third-party cloud providers, threat actors are abusing exposed administrative accounts (<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/">Valid Accounts</a>) to gain privileged access and exfiltrate data more effectively.  Recorded Futures 2023 Annual Report <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/2023-annual-report">highlighted</a> a 22% increase in validated cyberattacks leveraging the Valid Accounts technique. Based on initial analysis of 2024 data, threat actors continue to abuse valid accounts at various stages of an attack sequencesuch as discovery, privilege escalation, and defense evasionto facilitate data theft. These accounts enable lateral movement within networks to access sensitive systems, facilitate reconnaissance by appearing as normal user activity, and help blend into regular traffic to avoid triggering security alerts.</li></ul><h2 id="getting-ahead-of-the-problem">Getting Ahead of the Problem</h2><p>One immediate action security teams can take to improve their organizations risk profile is to create a vendor catalog to identify all external parties with access to company data. Use of risk management software, such as Recorded Futures <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/data-sheets/third-party-intelligence.pdf">Third-Party Intelligence Module</a>, enables extended visibility across the entire third-party ecosystem to uncover risk exposures and prioritize risk mitigation. </p><p>More long-term actions can also be helpful in mitigating the chances or severity of a data breach: </p><ul><li><a href="https://www.immuta.com/blog/what-is-data-tokenization/">Tokenization</a> or encryption helps to render sensitive data meaningless or inaccessible, respectively, outside of a secure environment. Organizations can reduce exposure to risks associated with storing sensitive data and maintain compliance with data privacy laws and regulations by implementing the appropriate method. An audit of necessary tasks associated with data, and not just the sensitivity of data itself, can help with applying the principle of least privilege effectively. </li><li>Close collaboration between multiple teams   forensics, incident response, and legal and compliance  can more successfully manage the fallout from potential data breaches. If these teams do not already have a good working relationship, chances are low that they will automatically have one in response to a severe and public data breach. As a result, it is a good idea for these teams to know each other well outside of a crisis.</li></ul><p>1 Sources: H1 2024: <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2024-0910.pdf">Malware and Vulnerability Trends Report</a>, <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/enhanced-ransomware-solution-announcement">Recorded Future Ransomware Solution</a>, <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/2024/results-and-analysis-intro/">Verizon 2024 Results and Analysis</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

These centers aim to amplify the Chinese Communist Party&#39;s (CCP) voice on the international stage, <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/elephants-street-dance-chinese-communist-party-appeal-youth-overseas-propaganda">targeting specific audiences</a> with tailored messaging (a strategy known as precise communication). ICCs coordinate local, national, and international resources to build China&#39;s image, share political narratives, and promote economic partnerships.</p><p>By leveraging inauthentic social media amplification, foreign influencers, and collaborations with overseas media, ICCs advance <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/china-propaganda-targets-bbc-uk">Chinas multi-layered propaganda</a> approach. For instance, Fujian&#39;s ICC reportedly manages TikTok accounts targeting Taiwanese audiences, likely including a covert account that is highly critical of the Taiwan government called Two Tea Eggs. On YouTube, the same ICC promotes videos of Taiwanese individuals praising China. These centers are strategically positioned to promote China&#39;s interests during geopolitical crises, despite challenges like limited credibility and resource constraints.</p><h2 id="breaking-the-circle-chinese-communist-party-propaganda-infrastructure-rapidly-expands">Breaking the Circle: Chinese Communist Party Propaganda Infrastructure Rapidly Expands</h2><p><a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/chinas-narrative-war-democracy">China&#39;s efforts to reshape global narratives</a> about its policies, culture, and geopolitical aims have reached new heights with the rapid proliferation of international communication centers (ICCs). Established to amplify the voice of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), these centers are integral to <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/1-key-for-1-lock-chinese-communist-party-strategy-targeted-propaganda">China&#39;s global propaganda apparatus</a> and seek to propel the CCPs precise communication strategy for targeting distinct audiences. Heres a closer look at their functions, strategies, and implications.</p><h2 id="what-are-iccs">What Are ICCs?</h2><p>ICCs are propaganda hubs designed to bring new resources to the CCPs efforts to tell Chinas story by centralizing and streamlining the capabilities of provinces, cities, and smaller jurisdictions. These centers focus on building China&#39;s global image by sharing positive narratives about its culture, economy, and development. Simultaneously, they act as a conduit for political narratives aimed at countering negative perceptions and promoting China&#39;s geopolitical agenda.</p><p>Over 100 ICCs have been established across China, primarily since 2023, under provincial and sub-provincial propaganda departments and state media organizations. These centers aim to &quot;break the circle&quot; to penetrate foreign audiences and tailoring content for specific regions and demographics.</p><h2 id="key-objectives-of-iccs">Key Objectives of ICCs</h2><p>ICCs primarily aim to promote positive narratives about China. They create content that highlights the countrys cultural heritage, technological innovations, and economic progress, fostering goodwill among international audiences. Additionally, ICCs counter negative narratives by responding to perceived anti-China sentiments and disseminating content to influence public opinion on geopolitical topics. By tailoring their approaches to specific regions and demographics, ICCs strive to ensure their narratives resonate more effectively. For example, Fujians ICC specifically targets Taiwanese audiences using TikTok accounts that blend cultural themes with critical political messaging.</p><h2 id="tactics-and-strategies">Tactics and Strategies</h2><p>ICCs employ various tactics to achieve their objectives. <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/china-social-media-operations">Social media operations form a core component of their strategy</a>, with thousands of accounts active across platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok. Many of these accounts lack transparency about their state affiliations, enabling covert influence campaigns. Additionally, ICCs leverage foreign influencers and communication officers to amplify Chinas narratives through user-generated content, vlogs, and experiential propaganda.</p><p>Collaboration with overseas media organizations further enhances ICCs&#39; reach and legitimacy. Through actions like organizing foreign journalist visits to China, ICCs create an impression of organic coverage and offer an alternative to Western narratives. These partnerships  reportedly established in Australia, Brazil, Cambodia, Egypt, France, Japan, Russia, the United States, and elsewhere  are complemented by localized propaganda activities that align with Chinas economic and geopolitical interests. S</p><h2 id="challenges-to-success">Challenges to Success</h2><p>Despite ambitious goals, ICCs face significant challenges that hinder their effectiveness. These include a lack of professional and foreign talent, insufficient discourse power, inadequate data for precise communication, and inconsistent funding. ICCs often struggle to translate local developments into effective narratives for foreign audiences and lack focus on target demographics. Many rely heavily on central state media infrastructure, as seen with the Nanning International Communication Center outsourcing key operations to Xinhua News Agency. These limitations echo long-standing issues within China&#39;s state media sector.</p><h2 id="implications">Implications</h2><p>ICCs represent a sophisticated evolution in China&#39;s propaganda efforts. While they are unlikely to become trusted sources of information in the near term, their ability to amplify preferred narratives during geopolitical crises is likely significant. These centers likely have the potential to influence foreign opinion of China by offering regular engagement, providing alternatives to Western sources, and focusing on topics like quality of life in China rather than political values, especially among Global South and Western periphery audiences.</p><h2 id="outlook">Outlook</h2><p>The expansion of international communication centers (ICCs) reflects China&#39;s ongoing efforts to innovate its media strategy, centralize resources, and project global narratives favoring its interests under Xi Jinping&#39;s leadership. Despite challenges, ICCs likely strengthen China&#39;s ability to influence global discourse by leveraging thousands of overt and covert social media accounts and fostering collaborations with foreign media. These centers could amplify assertive messaging during crises and suppress negative coverage of China.</p><p>China&#39;s long-term goal is almost certainly to establish ICC-affiliated platforms as trusted sources of information. While this remains unlikely in the near term due to credibility challenges, ICCs represent a strategic step toward improving Chinas external propaganda system. Researchers and governments should prioritize tracking ICC activities and advocating for transparent labeling of their state affiliations on social media platforms.</p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/ta-cn-2024-1210.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png"></p><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>Scam websites have emerged as a significant threat in financial fraud, leveraging seasonal opportunities and advanced tactics to deceive cardholders and evade bank defenses. Recorded Future&#39;s Payment Fraud Intelligence team has identified that threat actors operate these scams across five stages: procurement, lure creation, delivery, website setup, and monetization. They exploit psychological triggers and seasonal trends like holidays and shopping events to maximize victim susceptibility.</p><p>Key methods include phishing kits, fraudulent merchant accounts, and live admin panels that enhance the effectiveness of scams while complicating detection. Threat actors use techniques such as typosquatting, malvertising, and smishing to deliver scam lures, while their websites are designed to trick victims into sharing sensitive information.</p><h2 id="scam-websites-understanding-the-threat-and-combating-fraud">Scam Websites: Understanding the Threat and Combating Fraud</h2><p>Scam websites have become a growing concern in recent years, posing risks not only to individual cardholders but also to financial institutions and merchants. These websites, often indistinguishable from legitimate platforms, exploit seasonal opportunities and sophisticated tactics to defraud victims at scale. This research explores how scam websites operate, the methods used by threat actors, and actionable strategies for mitigation.</p><h2 id="stages-of-scam-website-operations">Stages of Scam Website Operations</h2><p>Scam website operations follow five distinct stages:</p><ol><li><strong>Procurement</strong><br>Threat actors gather resources such as domains, phishing kits, and fraudulent merchant accounts. Seasonal trends play a significant role, with typosquatting and scam kits tailored to holidays or shopping events like Black Friday.</li><li><strong>Lure Creation</strong><br>Scammers design lures that exploit urgency and trust. Common methods include brand impersonation, limited-time offers, and fear tactics during tax season.</li><li><strong>Lure Delivery</strong><br>Lures are distributed through online ads, smishing (SMS phishing), and phishing emails. Social media and search engines are frequently exploited for large-scale delivery.</li><li><strong>Website Setup</strong><br>Scam websites mirror legitimate sites to deceive victims into entering sensitive data. Payment forms and account update requests are designed to appear authentic.</li><li><strong>Monetization</strong><br>Threat actors leverage stolen data for card-not-present (CNP) fraud, resale on dark web forums, or fraudulent transactions through merchant accounts.</li></ol><p>Seasonal trends significantly increase the effectiveness of scam websites. Holidays, tax filing periods, and shopping events create urgency among victims, making them more likely to fall for scams. For example, Black Friday scams use high discounts to lure victims, while tax season scams exploit fear of penalties.</p><p>Sophisticated methods like live admin panels and payment cloaking make scams harder to detect. Live admin panels allow real-time interception of victim data and OTPs (one-time passwords), enabling high-success fraud.</p><p>Additionally, threat actors use fraudulent merchant accounts linked to scam websites, allowing immediate monetization and recurring charges. These tactics complicate fraud detection and recovery efforts for banks and cardholders alike.</p><h2 id="mitigation-strategies">Mitigation Strategies</h2><p>To combat scam websites, both financial institutions and individuals must take proactive measures:</p><ul>        <li><strong>For Financial Institutions:</strong></li>    <ul>        <li>Monitor dark web forums for phishing kits and merchant account offerings.</li>        <li>Educate customers about common scam tactics and encourage reporting.</li>        <li>Leverage <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/payment-fraud-intelligence">Recorded Future Payment Fraud intelligence</a> (PFI) to detect and mitigate possible scam websites using the PFI common-point-of-purchase (CPP) dataset.</li>        <li>Leverage <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/brand-intelligence">Recorded Future Brand Intelligence</a> to detect and mitigate brand impersonation threats common among scam websites.</li>    </ul></ul>    <ul>        <li><strong>For Individuals:</strong></li>    <ul>        <li>Verify website URLs and use only trusted platforms for transactions.</li>        <li>Avoid acting on unsolicited offers or advertisements without verification.</li>        <li>Report suspected scams to banks and dispute fraudulent charges promptly.</li>    </ul></ul><h2 id="outlook">Outlook</h2><p>Scam website operations are rapidly evolving, with threat actors adopting sophisticated tactics reminiscent of early Magecart e-skimmer methods. Notable developments include scam campaigns targeting mobile users to evade detection and using low-value transactions to establish trust before initiating high-value fraud. Fraudulent merchant accounts, linked to scam websites, have become a key innovation, enabling immediate and recurring monetization while complicating detection.</p><p>This method is likely to grow in prominence, especially as future PCI-DSS v4.0 requirements limit other fraud techniques. However, regulatory measures like the US FTC&#39;s &quot;click-to-cancel&quot; rule and stricter Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols could significantly curb these operations by addressing loopholes that scammers currently exploit.</p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2024-1126.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png"></p><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>Operation Undercut is a covert influence operation conducted by Russias Social Design Agency (SDA) to sway public opinion against Ukraine and weaken Western support. Leveraging AI-enhanced videos and impersonating reputable news sources, Operation Undercut disseminates disinformation targeting audiences across the US, Ukraine, and Europe. This operation, running in tandem with other campaigns like <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/russian-influence-network-doppelgangers-ai-content-tactics">Doppelgnger</a>, is designed to discredit Ukraines leadership, question the effectiveness of Western aid, and stir socio-political tensions. The campaign also seeks to shape narratives around the 2024 US elections and geopolitical conflicts, such as the Israel-Gaza situation, to deepen divisions.</p><h2 id="operation-undercut-shows-multifaceted-nature-of-sdas-influence-operations">&quot;Operation Undercut&quot; Shows Multifaceted Nature of SDAs Influence Operations</h2><p>Russia&#39;s Social Design Agency (SDA) has been running an influence operation known as &quot;Operation Undercut&quot; since late 2023, aiming to <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/russia-seeks-exploit-western-war-fatigue-win-ukraine">erode Western support for Ukraine</a>. Using a mix of AI-enhanced media and impersonation tactics, Operation Undercut employs advanced methods to manipulate public opinion. </p><h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2><p>Operation Undercut is part of Russia&#39;s broader strategy to destabilize Western alliances and portray Ukraines leadership as ineffective and corrupt. By targeting audiences in Europe and the US, the SDA seeks to amplify anti-Ukraine sentiment, hoping to reduce the flow of Western military aid to Ukraine. The operation also spreads narratives that suggest US and EU involvement in Ukraine is misguided, costly, and largely ineffective.</p><p>In addition to undermining support for Ukraine, Operation Undercut <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/russian-information-operations-divide-western-coalition-ukraine">seeks to widen existing divisions within Western societies</a>. The campaign addresses several geopolitical issues, such as the Israel-Gaza conflict, the EU&#39;s internal politics, and the <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/malign-influence-threats-mount-ahead-us-2024-elections">2024 US elections</a>. By connecting Ukraine&#39;s fate to these contentious topics, Operation Undercut attempts to stoke anxieties and polarize public opinion.</p><h2 id="tactics-techniques-and-procedures-ttps">Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)</h2><p><strong>AI-Enhanced Videos and Impersonation of News Outlets</strong></p><p>Operation Undercut uses <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/adversarial-intelligence-red-teaming-malicious-use-cases-ai">AI-enhanced videos and images, many of which mimic trusted media sources</a>, to make disinformation appear credible. AI-generated voiceovers and realistic images amplify these narratives, creating content that is difficult to distinguish from legitimate news. By adopting branding elements from respected outlets, the operation enhances its contents believability, misleading audiences and eroding trust in genuine media sources.</p><p><strong>Targeted Social Media Campaigns</strong></p><p>SDA&#39;s accounts post highly tailored content on multiple platforms, often using trending hashtags to reach target audiences. The content varies by region and language, including posts in English, German, French, Polish, and Turkish, ensuring that messages resonate across diverse audiences. By focusing on real-time issues, the operation maximizes its reach, though most posts have shown limited engagement.</p><p><strong>Amplification of CopyCop Content</strong></p><p>Operation Undercut has amplified content from <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/copycop-expands-to-cover-us-elections-target-political-leaders">CopyCop (also known as Storm-1516), a Russian influence network</a> linked to John Mark Dougan and allegedly backed by Alexander Dugin&#39;s Centre for Geopolitical Expertise (CGE) and the GRU&#39;s Unit 29155. Examples include a <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/deepfakes-id-verification">deepfake video</a> featuring a supposed Hamas member threatening the 2024 Paris Olympics and an image accusing Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky of buying an Italian villa during the 2024 G7 summit.</p><h2 id="key-narratives">Key Narratives</h2><p><strong>Discrediting Ukraine and Western Aid</strong></p><p>One of Operation Undercuts primary themes is discrediting Ukraines leadership and questioning the effectiveness of Western aid. The campaign accuses Ukrainian leaders of corruption, claiming they misuse foreign aid to fund luxurious lifestyles. This narrative aims to undermine public support for continued financial and military assistance to Ukraine, particularly among European audiences.</p><p><strong>Exploiting the Israel-Gaza Conflict</strong></p><p>The operation also attempts to manipulate public opinion regarding the Israel-Gaza conflict, alleging Western bias and intelligence manipulation. By highlighting divisive issues in global politics, Operation Undercut creates distractions and deepens divides, weakening Western alliances and distracting from Russia&#39;s involvement in Ukraine.</p><p><strong>Tensions Within the EU and US Election Influence</strong></p><p>Operation Undercut amplifies existing political tensions within the European Union by supporting far-right narratives and criticizing EU leaders. Similarly, it seeks to influence the 2024 US elections by framing military aid to Ukraine as a contentious political issue. By presenting Ukraines future as contingent on US election outcomes, the operation fosters anxiety over the West&#39;s political stability.</p><h2 id="mitigations">Mitigations</h2><ul><li>News organizations should track content from known influence actors who are likely abusing their brand. Such abuse increases reputational risks and erodes consumer trust, potentially deterring advertisers and inflicting financial harm on the impersonated organizations.</li><li>Political leaders and government officials from countries providing support to Ukraine should continue monitoring for content attempting to discredit them to identify and counter emerging narratives.</li><li>Public and news organizations can use <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/brand-intelligence">Recorded Future Brand Intelligence</a> to track and combat typosquatting domains and infringing content on similar domains, which can harm a news organizations reputation.</li><li>Clients can use the <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform/intelligence-cloud">Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud</a> to track Operation Undercut activity and Recorded Future AI to summarize and track emerging narratives.</li></ul><h2 id="outlook">Outlook</h2><p>The SDA is expected to continue running influence operations, including Operation Undercut, while likely rebuilding infrastructure for Doppelgnger and using established content and amplification tactics. Tasked by Russias Presidential Administration, these operations aim to shape global opinions on Ukraine and exploit major events to undermine support for Ukraine. The investigation, which uses data from Recorded Future, government sources, and other reports, underscores the value of a collaborative approach across sectors to expose and disrupt these destabilizing activities. </p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/TA-RU-2024-1126.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/insikt_group_logo_updated_3_300x48_b5390f4ff2.png" alt="insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png"></p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>Insikt Group has identified an ongoing cyber-espionage campaign conducted by TAG-110, a Russia-aligned threat group targeting organizations in Central Asia, East Asia, and Europe. Using custom malware tools HATVIBE and CHERRYSPY, TAG-110 primarily attacks government entities, human rights groups, and educational institutions. The campaigns tactics align with the historical activities of UAC-0063, attributed to Russian APT group BlueDelta (APT28). HATVIBE functions as a loader to deploy CHERRYSPY, a Python backdoor used for data exfiltration and espionage. Initial access is often achieved through phishing emails or exploiting vulnerable web-facing services like Rejetto HTTP File Server.</p><p>TAG-110s efforts are likely part of a broader Russian strategy to gather intelligence on geopolitical developments and maintain influence in post-Soviet states. Insikt Group provides actionable insights, including indicators of compromise and Snort and YARA rules, to help organizations.</p><hr><h2 id="russia-aligned-tag-110-targets-asia-and-europe-with-hatvibe-and-cherryspy">Russia-Aligned TAG-110 Targets Asia and Europe with HATVIBE and CHERRYSPY</h2><p>Advanced persistent threat (APT) groups aligned with nation-states continue to execute sophisticated campaigns to fulfill strategic objectives. Insikt Group recently identified a Russia-aligned cyber-espionage campaign conducted by TAG-110 targeting organizations across Central Asia, East Asia, and Europe. This group deploys custom malware, including HATVIBE and CHERRYSPY, to conduct operations aligned with Russian geopolitical interests.</p><h3 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h3><ul><li><strong>TAG-110 Overview:</strong> A threat group overlapping with UAC-0063, TAG-110 is linked to the Russian APT group BlueDelta (APT28) with moderate confidence.</li><li><strong>Targets:</strong> Governments, human rights groups, and educational institutions in Central Asia and neighboring regions.</li><li><strong>Malware Used:</strong> HATVIBE, a custom HTML application loader, and CHERRYSPY, a Python-based backdoor, are central to the campaign.</li><li><strong>Scale of Impact:</strong> Since July 2024, 62 victims across eleven countries have been identified, with notable incidents in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan.</li></ul><h3 id="hatvibe">HATVIBE</h3><p>HATVIBE serves as a loader for deploying additional malware like CHERRYSPY. Delivered via malicious email attachments or exploited web-facing vulnerabilities, it achieves persistence through scheduled tasks executed by the mshta.exe utility.</p><p>HATVIBEs obfuscation techniques include VBScript encoding and XOR encryption. Once deployed, it communicates with command-and-control (C2) servers using HTTP PUT requests, providing critical system details.</p><h3 id="cherryspy">CHERRYSPY</h3><p>CHERRYSPY, a Python-based backdoor, complements HATVIBE by enabling secure data exfiltration. It uses robust encryption methods, including RSA and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), to establish communication with its C2 servers. TAG-110 uses CHERRYSPY to monitor victims systems and extract sensitive information, often targeting government and research entities.</p><h3 id="campaign-objectives">Campaign Objectives</h3><p>TAG-110s activities align with Russias geopolitical objectives, particularly in Central Asia, where Moscow seeks to maintain influence amid strained relations. Intelligence gathered through these campaigns likely aids in bolstering Russias military efforts and understanding regional dynamics.</p><h3 id="mitigation-strategies">Mitigation Strategies</h3><p>To defend against TAG-110 and similar threats, organizations should:</p><ol><li><strong>Monitor for Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):</strong> Use intrusion detection systems (IDSs), intrusion prevention systems (IPSs), and network defense tools to detect malicious domains and IPs associated with TAG-110.</li><li><strong>Deploy Detection Rules:</strong> Leverage Snort, Suricata, and YARA rules for identifying HATVIBE and CHERRYSPY-related activities.</li><li><strong>Patch Vulnerabilities:</strong> Ensure timely updates of software to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities like CVE-2024-23692.</li><li><strong>Enhance Threat Awareness:</strong> Train employees to recognize phishing attempts and enforce multi-factor authentication.</li><li><strong>Leverage Intelligence Tools:</strong> Use Recorded Futures solutions for digital risk protection, credential monitoring, and real-time threat intelligence.</li></ol><h3 id="outlook">Outlook</h3><p>TAG-110 is expected to continue its cyber-espionage campaigns, focusing on post-Soviet Central Asian states, Ukraine, and Ukraines allies. These regions are significant to Moscow due to strained relations following Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine. While TAG-110s ties to BlueDelta remain unconfirmed, its activities align with BlueDeltas strategic interests in national security, military operations, and geopolitical influence.</p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/CTA-RU-2024-1121.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p><h2>Appendix A  Indicators of Compromise</h2><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td style="font-family:Courier New;background-color:#ffffff;"><strong>C2 Domains:</strong><br>enrollmentdm[.]com<br>errorreporting[.]net<br>experience-improvement[.]com<br>game-wins[.]com<br>internalsecurity[.]us<br>lanmangraphics[.]com<br>retaildemo[.]info<br>shared-rss[.]info<br>telemetry-network[.]com<br>tieringservice[.]com<br>trust-certificate[.]net<br><br><strong>C2 IP Addresses:</strong><br>5.45.70[.]178<br>45.136.198[.]18<br>45.136.198[.]184<br>45.136.198[.]189<br>46.183.219[.]228<br>84.32.188[.]23<br>185.62.56[.]47<br>185.158.248[.]198<br>185.167.63[.]42<br>194.31.55[.]131<br>212.224.86[.]69<br><br></td></tr></tbody></table>            <p><br><br></p><h2>Appendix B  Mitre ATT&CK Techniques</h2><table style="background-color:#ffffff;"><tr><td style="background-color:#0071CE;color:#ffffff;font-weight: 700;"><strong>Tactic: Technique</strong></td><td style="background-color:#0071CE;color:#ffffff;font-weight: 700;"><strong>ATT&CK Code</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Resource Development:</strong> Acquire Infrastructure: Virtual Private Server</td><td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/003/" rel="nofollow noopener">T1583.003</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Initial Access:</strong> Exploit Public-Facing Application</td><td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/" rel="nofollow noopener">T1190</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Initial Access:</strong> Spearphishing Attachment</td><td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001/" rel="nofollow noopener">T1566.001</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Execution:</strong> Visual Basic</td><td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/005/" rel="nofollow noopener">T1059.005</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Execution:</strong> Malicious File</td><td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/002/" rel="nofollow noopener">T1204.002</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Persistence:</strong> Scheduled Task</td><td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/005/" rel="nofollow noopener">T1053.005</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Defense Evasion:</strong> Encrypted/Encoded File</td><td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/013/" rel="nofollow noopener">T1027.013</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Defense Evasion:</strong> System Binary Proxy Execution: Mshta</td><td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218/005/" rel="nofollow noopener">T1218.005</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Command-and-Control:</strong> Web Protocols</td><td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/001/" rel="nofollow noopener">T1071.001</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Command-and-Control:</strong> Symmetric Cryptography</td><td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1573/001/" rel="nofollow noopener">T1573.001</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Command-and-Control:</strong> Asymmetric Cryptography</td><td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1573/002/" rel="nofollow noopener">T1573.002</a></td></tr></table>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[From Magecart to Mobile Menaces]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Editor&#39;s note: The following blog post originally appeared on <a href="https://intelligence2risk.substack.com/">Levi Gundert&#39;s Substack page</a>.</strong></em></p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/9530ea14_3d82_4c7a_beac_a3260db82f1b_1024x1024_1284675518.webp" alt="9530ea14-3d82-4c7a-beac-a3260db82f1b_1024x1024.webp"></p><p><a href="https://cxotoday.com/specials/gartner-why-cyber-fraud-fusion-is-the-future-of-online-fraud-detection/">Gartner estimates</a> that 5% of large enterprises currently maintain cyber-fraud fusion centers, which is expected to jump to 20% by 2028. Fusion sounds high speed, but bringing together multiple teams for a shared mission can slow down operations if not managed effectively. A traditional <a href="https://www.comptia.org/content/articles/what-is-a-security-operations-center">SOC</a> masquerading as a fusion center with little more than <a href="https://threatbutt.com/map/">pew pew maps</a> (not to diminish their effectiveness with executives) defeats the purpose. A successful fusion center removes data silos and works across traditionally divided teams (e.g., Incident Response, Cyber Threat Intelligence, Fraud)  to improve threat actor campaign analysis and reduce losses. Cyber-fraud fusion centers improve communication and collaboration through organizational (and perhaps physical) proximity, leading to better fraud loss reduction outcomes. </p><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>Before exposing cyber-fraud data flows and focused loss mitigation examples, a few words about the problem and a prerequisite for success. In January, Nasdaq released a <a href="https://ir.nasdaq.com/news-releases/news-release-details/nasdaq-releases-first-global-financial-crime-report-measuring">remarkable report</a> that quantified illicit money movement, including losses from fraud scams and bank fraud schemes accounted for nearly $500 billion globally in 2023. That number is a significant enticement for threat actors to continue with successful tactics while also investing in new fraud innovations. </p><p>A thriving fusion center requires a leader with vision and experience (in cyber defense operations and fraud) and the mandate authority (juice) to remove traditional enterprise barriers (organizational empire building, information gatekeeping, vendor firewalling, etc.). </p><h2 id="improved-data-driven-workflows">Improved Data-Driven Workflows</h2><p>The fusion concept is vital in this fraud context because CTI analysts generally focus on identifying malicious fraud communities and associated TTPs (tools, tactics, procedures). Fraud analysts, conversely, are concerned with creating fraud analytics toward enhanced remediation. In traditional organizations, the CTI and fraud teams sit in separate departments and are constrained by politically driven data silos.  Optimized information workflows for maximum fraud impact remain elusive. When implemented correctly, cyber-fraud fusion centers remove perverse incentives and enable a unified team to make the organization more effective. </p><p>In each of these examples, well examine how CTI can enrich fraud investigations and help shift from a reactive to a proactive posture (though overused, this proactive notion is appropriate here).</p><h2 id="example-alpha---payment-cards">Example Alpha - Payment Cards</h2><p>A straightforward example includes payment card fraud (card present - CP and card not present - CNP). CTI teams will identify and collect in criminal forums, marketplaces, and other communities where stolen full or partial payment card details are advertised and sold. </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/1f81209f_bc4c_4662_b3d9_c6a17381ef73_1304x569_345c0e0036.webp" alt="1f81209f-bc4c-4662-b3d9-c6a17381ef73_1304x569.webp"></p><p><em>An example database of stolen payment cards.</em> </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/535efde5_1747_44a8_b9d0_bd0e4034c0dc_495x656_c8efd83945.webp" alt="535efde5-1747-44a8-b9d0-bd0e4034c0dc_495x656.webp"></p><p><em>Stolen payment card services branding.</em></p><p>A fraud team workflow may include:</p><ul><li>Identify at-risk cards and monitor the associated portfolio exposure in real time</li><li>Track fraud mitigation turnaround time as a primary KPI (key performance indicator). </li><li>Reduce criminal interest in specific payment card portfolios</li><li>Decrease false-positive rates in risk-scoring solutions</li><li>Conduct CPP (common point of purchase) analysis before chargeback data arrives</li></ul><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/5436d892_398d_443a_b3f6_8d891ec8d80e_2145x396_eb07654c2a.webp" alt="5436d892-398d-443a-b3f6-8d891ec8d80e_2145x396.webp"></p><p><em>A Telegram-sourced conversation - courtesy of Recorded Future - regarding defeating fraud detection mechanisms.</em></p><p>Commonly used fraud controls include KYC (Know Your Customer) rules, test transaction monitoring (a strong fraud precursor signal), CAMS (Compromised Account Management Systems) alerts, and CPP (common point of purchase) analysis. The issue is that all of these controls are reactive. CTI, when done well, changes the paradigm in that intelligence is proactively driving fraud prevention, reducing the efficacy of fraudster tactics, and traditional fraud controls become deprecated as a first line of defense. </p><h2 id="example-beta---pii--ato">Example Beta - PII &amp; ATO</h2><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/cb68aecb_6515_45cc_a06f_914f86d9cdd2_2145x1393_dc05e28a4d.webp" alt="cb68aecb-6515-45cc-a06f-914f86d9cdd2_2145x1393.webp"></p><p><em>Recorded Future AI insights and cashout service branding.</em></p><p>Some organizations (e.g., retailers) may not issue payment cards, but experience heavy fraud losses due to the unauthorized access of personally identifiable information (in the U.S., valuable PII for fraud may include: physical address, email address, date of birth, social security number, phone number, mothers maiden name, etc.), which is subsequently used to tailor social engineering attacks that lead to account takeover (ATO). This is also true for banks. A stolen payment card may be quickly identified and re-issued, but the associated stolen PII may lead to fraud losses through call center social engineering and/or online channel security bypass. The unauthorized access to online accounts may lead to unauthorized money movement to mules who specialize in maintaining bank accounts to receive stolen funds and cash out.</p><p>In another life, working with banks, we engaged fraudsters online to identify previously dormant cash-out accounts. At the time, even if a victim wasnt participating in online account access, fraudsters would enroll victims using stolen PII and create the necessary authentication details (username, password, etc.). Out of convenience, all compromised accounts contained the same password. </p><p>ATO mechanisms include MFA prompt fatigue (the victim is tired of selecting no and seeing a dialogue prompt reappear), <a href="https://therecord.media/hackers-breached-california-state-welfare">credential stuffing / brute forcing</a>, social engineering, <a href="https://therecord.media/sec-twitter-account-hack-arrest-alabama">SIM swapping</a>, password resets, etc. Naturally, GenAI is reducing the time to prepare and deliver while increasing the quality of <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/qr-code-and-ai-generated-phishing-proliferate">social engineering campaigns</a>. ATO and associated cashout techniques are constantly changing. Fraud professionals collaborating with CTI will help identify the right threat actors for engagement to further intelligence objectives that lead to fraud control improvements. </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/521d5535_f191_49e8_ba94_b72acbb73d69_1600x853_0ccd523888.webp" alt="521d5535-f191-49e8-ba94-b72acbb73d69_1600x853.webp"></p><p><em>An infostealer coterie - Lumma, Vidar, Raccoon, Redline.</em></p><p>Additionally, infostealers (a specific label for a malware genus focused on extracting all victim PII and more from web browsers) have stolen billions of victim credentials, cookie values, and more. This data treasure trove enables fraudsters to use valid credentials and quickly achieve ATO for both social engineering and direct money movement in financial services platforms.</p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/d5587f91_764b_4ee8_99b5_fc179997512d_1525x959_1087a20ab1.webp" alt="d5587f91-764b-4ee8-99b5-fc179997512d_1525x959.webp"></p><p><em>Recorded Future AI Insights for ATO channels.</em></p><h2 id="focused-examples">Focused Examples</h2><p><strong>Example Charlie - Magecart Compromised Merchants</strong></p><p><a href="https://therecord.media/canadas-largest-alcohol-retailer-infected-with-card-skimming-malware-twice-since-december">Magecart</a> is the label for specific malicious scripts (code) loaded into vulnerable e-commerce platforms to skim payment card details during customer payment. As previously mentioned, Magecart victims may have to consider more than just replacing their payment cards in <a href="https://substack.com/@intelligence2risk/note/c-73182811">certain shopping contexts</a>. </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/0c4e1515_0f4f_49a7_8a9b_7bf43759b661_1600x674_16619fe6a3.webp" alt="0c4e1515-0f4f-49a7-8a9b-7bf43759b661_1600x674.webp"></p><p><em>A Magecart data flow diagram.</em></p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/f94439ab_c01b_49de_99b0_778eac9a338f_975x535_5b2b7e6213.webp" alt="f94439ab-c01b-49de-99b0-778eac9a338f_975x535.webp"></p><p><em>Details of e-skimmer code illustrating customer fields for exfiltration.</em></p><p>Proactive Magecart intelligence is important for e-commerce retailers and financial services companies advising and alerting retailers, specifically small and medium-sized companies with fewer resources to invest in security. Magecart TTP evolutions require corresponding agile detections. Several historical Magecart operating changes observed by Recorded Futures Payment Fraud Intelligence (PFI) team include:</p><ul><li>Using Google Tag Manager</li><li>Payment card data exfiltration to Telegram </li><li>Hiding malicious scripts within SVG elements and using stenography</li><li>Using compromised websites as proxies to distribute malicious payloads</li></ul><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/5627b94a_8ab0_4f08_915e_d67e1e8a22f8_1183x808_f7f9ed594d.webp" alt="5627b94a-8ab0-4f08-915e-d67e1e8a22f8_1183x808.webp"></p><p>Fraud teams can track the monetization paths and timelines post-compromise, while CTI teams can actively help identify magecart-victimized merchants before the monetization clock starts. </p><p><strong>Example Delta - Scam Merchants</strong></p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/7b868a76_5e3d_41a8_bd37_336998c1b4ed_2145x972_18a6e4265a.webp" alt="7b868a76-5e3d-41a8-bd37-336998c1b4ed_2145x972.webp"></p><p><em>A verified scam retail website.</em></p><p>A comprehensive strategy to uncover scam merchants involves open-source research, collaboration with industry partners, and advanced data analysis. Organizations can source suspicious websites by monitoring social media advertisements, reviewing domain registration details, and investigating patterns in merchant account behavior. Further validation of potential scam websites can be achieved by correlating domain data with cards exposed on the dark web, identifying common patterns across fraudulent sites, and leveraging consumer reports of suspicious activity. By integrating these insights, organizations can avoid emerging threats and effectively mitigate payment fraud risks.</p><p><strong>Example Echo - Android Banking Trojans</strong></p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/c03e972d_e0d3_438d_a8d2_8b5a9a2c1195_657x548_ddeb83cead.webp" alt="c03e972d-e0d3-438d-a8d2-8b5a9a2c1195_657x548.webp"></p><p>Mobile malware is particularly pernicious in retail banking geographies outside of North America. Recorded Future observes thousands of malicious files with anti-virus signature names like <a href="https://app.recordedfuture.com/portal/intelligence-card/kDbVGx/overview">Hydra</a>, <a href="https://app.recordedfuture.com/portal/intelligence-card/ppu8fm/overview">Hook</a>, <a href="https://app.recordedfuture.com/portal/intelligence-card/jtLozO/overview">Sova</a>, and more every quarter. For example, <a href="https://thethaiger.com/hot-news/bank-of-thailand-warns-of-elevated-financial-cybercrime-risk">Thailand has been alerting</a> citizens to the dangers of installing unverified Android applications, which could drain their bank accounts. While mobile malware generally contains <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/predator-spyware-operators-rebuild-multi-tier-infrastructure-target-mobile-devices">many features</a> (e.g., accessing location services, camera snooping, reading/sending SMS, etc.) that achieve device takeover (DTO), creating <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Man-in-the-browser_attack">man-in-the-browser (MitB)</a> capabilities during online banking sessions is the most impactful for fraud losses because traditional <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/blogs/threat-session-hijacking-mfa-bypass">multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a> mechanisms become less effective when all communications channels can be intercepted and manipulated, leading to account takeover (ATO). </p><p>Again, while financial services fraud teams and government investigators have digital exhaust to follow after victimization, CTI teams should create alerts and dissect new mobile malware TTPs to better educate the banking and online shopping public (and pursue attribution). </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/c2bb4a00_97c2_4e27_9e36_d74fec23fe3d_1050x481_cdc65cd849.webp" alt="c2bb4a00-97c2-4e27-9e36-d74fec23fe3d_1050x481.webp"></p><p><em>A sample of malware tags derived from <a href="https://tria.ge/">Hatching Triage</a>.</em></p><p>Additionally, real-time notification of new mobile malware samples with associated meta-data improves bank prevention/detection systems via atomic indicators (e.g., user-agent strings, IP addresses, etc.) and internal log correlation. </p><p><strong>Example Foxtrot - Stolen Checks</strong></p><p>Physical (paper) checks are a relic of the banking system employed primarily in North America. Because these documents contain a routing and account number, they are still heavily used in <a href="https://abc7ny.com/check-washing-fraud-scam-money/12925374/">fraud</a>. Older generations are vulnerable as they may <a href="https://www.atlantafed.org/-/media/documents/banking/consumer-payments/research-data-reports/2020/02/13/us-consumers-use-of-personal-checks-evidence-from-a-diary-survey/rdr2001.pdf">prefer checks</a> for a reliable payment mechanism over other <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/payment-methods/2022/why-fintechs-are-turning-paper-checks-into-money-mobility-instruments/">fintech options</a>, which are perceived as potentially less reliable. </p><p>The CTI opportunity is to use <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/optical-character-recognition">optical character recognition (OCR)</a> for check image recognition in online criminal communities and proactively work with a fraud team to neutralize the inevitable fraud before victims report it. </p><p><img src="https://cms.recordedfuture.com/uploads/31102a54_a814_49a8_a8c2_9da1be6c3d4a_1200x1595_d241c26fb1.webp" alt="31102a54-a814-49a8-a8c2-9da1be6c3d4a_1200x1595.webp"></p><p><em>Stolen checks are shared in an online criminal community.</em></p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Strong leadership, clear expectations, and success measures are prerequisites for cyber-fraud fusion centers. By better understanding these complimentary workflows in:</p><ul><li>Payment card theft </li><li>E-commerce skimming</li><li>Physical checks</li><li>Mobile malware</li><li>Account takeover (ATO) and cash-out</li><li>Scam merchants</li></ul><p>fraud and CTI resources (human or machine) can better architect and deliver improved organizational fraud loss value. </p><p><em>Thank you to Recorded Futures Payment Fraud Intelligence (PFI) team and Insikt Group for their foundational work in enabling this blog and their continued excellence in malicious cyber fraud campaign analysis.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

Recent incidents, including break-ins at water treatment facilities in Finland and explosions at arms factories in Poland, highlight Russias use of gray zone tactics to undermine Western military, economic, and political capabilities without crossing the threshold of open conflict. Insikt Groups analysis identifies a pattern of Russian hybrid warfare involving covert operatives, agent networks, and plausible deniability tactics that echo Soviet-era sabotage strategies. With these tactics, <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/russia-seeks-exploit-western-war-fatigue-win-ukraine">Russia aims to degrade NATOs capacity to support Ukraine</a>, increase internal tensions, and strain emergency resources.</p><h3 id="russian-sabotage-activities-escalate-amid-fraught-tensions">Russian Sabotage Activities Escalate Amid Fraught Tensions</h3><p>As tensions between Russia and NATO remain high, Russia is very likely expanding its sabotage operations across Europe, with a focus on undermining NATOs support for Ukraine. These covert activities align with Russias broader hybrid warfare strategy, aiming to destabilize NATO countries, weaken their military capabilities, and strain political alliances. Recent incidents analyzed by Insikt Group reveal the calculated and persistent nature of Russian sabotage, using covert operatives, agent networks, and plausible deniability to avoid direct attribution.</p><h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2><p>Since <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/executive-overview-of-russian-aggression-against-ukraine">Russias invasion of Ukraine in 2022</a>, European governments have increasingly reported suspected sabotage activities linked to Russia. This gray zone warfare includes operations that damage critical infrastructure without escalating to open conflict. Russia perceives itself as being in a passive phase of war with NATO countries due to their military support for Ukraine, thus justifying these low-profile but effective actions as part of a broader strategy to weaken adversaries.</p><h3 id="recent-incidents-of-sabotage">Recent Incidents of Sabotage</h3><p>In June 2024, Insikt Group identified several incidents across six European countries bordering Russia that align with <a href="https://therecord.media/alarm-over-russia-sabotage-europe-spreads">Russian sabotage tactics</a>:</p><ul><li><strong>Finland:</strong> Break-ins at water treatment facilities were reported, raising concerns about potential contamination and public safety risks. These breaches are indicative of economic sabotage targeting essential resources.</li><li><strong>Poland:</strong> Explosions at the Mesko arms factory and fires at the Broad Gauge Metallurgy Line transshipment terminal caused significant disruptions. Given the strategic importance of these facilities in supplying arms to Ukraine, these incidents are likely intended to hinder NATOs logistical support to Ukraine.</li><li><strong>Norway:</strong> Multiple arson attacks on vehicles and fires at critical transport hubs have disrupted infrastructure, increasing operational strain on local authorities.</li></ul><p>These incidents exemplify Russias likely objectives: to degrade NATO&#39;s operational readiness, overwhelm emergency response systems, and create an atmosphere of insecurity among European populations.</p><h3 id="russian-sabotage-tactics">Russian Sabotage Tactics</h3><p>Russian sabotage activities rely on techniques that ensure plausible deniability. Intelligence networks recruit agents, often disaffected individuals or groups, who can execute these operations without drawing direct links to the Russian state. For example, covert operatives may infiltrate target nations under civilian covers, such as tourists or diplomats, or recruit local agents to avoid suspicion.</p><p>Russian sabotage tactics can be categorized into three groups:</p><ul><li><strong>Economic sabotage</strong>: Targeting infrastructure essential to economic stability, such as water treatment facilities and supply chains</li><li><strong>Military sabotage</strong>: Disrupting arms production, transportation, and military readiness through attacks on weapons factories or logistics hubs</li><li><strong>Political destabilization</strong>: Amplifying socio-political divisions and instilling fear within local populations by creating a persistent threat of sabotage</li></ul><h3 id="legacy-of-soviet-era-sabotage-strategies">Legacy of Soviet-Era Sabotage Strategies</h3><p>Russian sabotage objectives today are largely consistent with Soviet-era strategies, as detailed by defector accounts and declassified documents. The Soviet Union frequently deployed covert operatives to weaken adversaries before and during conflicts. Today, Russian operatives continue to use cover identities, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2021-0909.pdf">recruit agents</a>, and employ rudimentary means (like arson or improvised explosives) to maintain plausible deniability. This continuity highlights the enduring influence of Soviet military doctrines in Russias current approach to hybrid warfare.</p><h3 id="mitigations">Mitigations</h3><p>To counter the growing threat of Russian sabotage, NATO and its member states should strengthen infrastructure security and improve intelligence-sharing mechanisms across borders. Key steps include:</p><ul><li>Use Recorded Future Intelligence Clouds <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/geopolitical-intelligence">Facility Risk</a> feature to monitor notable events occurring in close proximity to critical infrastructure facilities.</li><li>Use the <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform/intelligence-cloud">Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud</a> to track potential Russian sabotage events and monitor commonly used tactics.</li><li>Enhance national and local counterintelligence, surveillance, and physical security monitoring measures around critical infrastructure, such as those identified in previously documented Russian sabotage operations.</li><li>Increase cooperation and intelligence-sharing among European nations on Russian sabotage activities and collaborate on identifying transnational Russian agent networks.</li><li>Monitor for signs of escalating Russian hybrid activities, such as sudden upticks in unexplained accidents or environmental incidents, and communicate risks to relevant businesses and industries.</li></ul><h2 id="outlook">Outlook</h2><p>Russias sabotage activities are unlikely to wane as tensions with NATO continue. As hybrid warfare evolves, so too will Russian tactics, with an increased emphasis on leveraging emerging technologies and maintaining deniability. The stakes for European security are high; Russian sabotage has the potential to not only disrupt essential services but also create political instability and weaken public trust in governments ability to protect their citizens.</p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/ta-ru-2024-1114.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Recorded Futures Insikt Group discovered that the attackers embedded malicious JavaScript in these sites, which spoofed a TLS certificate error to trick visitors into downloading a disguised security certificate. This malware, often used by threat actors for remote access and post-exploitation, highlights a continued cyber-espionage focus on Tibetan entities. TAG-112s infrastructure, concealed using Cloudflare, links this campaign to other China-sponsored operations, particularly TAG-102 (Evasive Panda).</p><hr><h2 id="china-based-tag-112-compromises-tibetan-websites-to-distribute-cobalt-strike">China-Based TAG-112 Compromises Tibetan Websites to Distribute Cobalt Strike</h2><p>Cyberattacks targeting ethnic and religious minority groups in China continue, with new developments pointing to a targeted campaign against Tibetan organizations. In a recent investigation, Recorded Futures Insikt Group discovered a Chinese state-sponsored threat actor group, designated TAG-112, responsible for compromising Tibetan community websites and delivering Cobalt Strike, a potent cyber-espionage tool.</p><h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2><p>In late May 2024, TAG-112 compromised at least two Tibetan community websites: Tibet Post (tibetpost[.]net) and Gyudmed Tantric University (gyudmedtantricuniversity[.]org). The attackers exploited vulnerabilities in the Joomla content management system (CMS) used by these sites to implant malicious JavaScript. This JavaScript prompted visitors to download a fake security certificate, which, when opened, deployed the Cobalt Strike payload.</p><p>TAG-112s infrastructure shows notable overlap with TAG-102 (<a href="https://therecord.media/china-based-hackers-evasive-isps-malware">Evasive Panda</a>), a more sophisticated Chinese state-sponsored group known for targeting Tibetan entities. However, Insikt Group has identified TAG-112 as a separate entity due to differences in attack maturity and tactics, such as using Cobalt Strike rather than custom malware and foregoing JavaScript obfuscation.</p><h3 id="malicious-javascript-and-spoofed-tls-error">Malicious JavaScript and Spoofed TLS Error</h3><p>The attack begins with the malicious JavaScript embedded in the compromised websites. When a user visits one of these sites, the script detects the operating system and browser type, confirming compatibility with Windows. If compatible, the script initiates a connection with TAG-112s command-and-control (C2) domain, update[.]maskrisks[.]com, which then returns an HTML page spoofing a legitimate TLS certificate error.</p><p>This spoofed error page is crafted to mimic Google Chromes TLS certificate warning, deceiving users into clicking a link to &quot;download a security certificate.&quot; Upon clicking, users unknowingly initiate the download of <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/detect-cobalt-strike-inside-look">Cobalt Strike</a>, a legitimate tool commonly used by security testers but often exploited by attackers for remote access and command execution.</p><h3 id="exploiting-website-vulnerabilities">Exploiting Website Vulnerabilities</h3><p>TAG-112 likely gained access to the compromised Tibetan websites through vulnerabilities in Joomla, a popular CMS. Websites built on Joomla are frequently targeted by attackers if they are not adequately maintained and updated. Likely by exploiting these weaknesses, TAG-112 was able to upload the malicious JavaScript file, which remains active on these sites as of early October 2024.</p><h3 id="infrastructure-and-obfuscation-tactics">Infrastructure and Obfuscation Tactics</h3><p>TAG-112s infrastructure shows a level of sophistication in concealing its origins. The group used Cloudflare to shield its servers&#39; IP addresses, complicating efforts to trace the infrastructure back to its origin. Insikt Group identified multiple IP addresses linked to TAG-112s C2 servers, some active as early as March 2024. The primary domain, maskrisks[.]com, was registered in March 2024 through Namecheap, with subdomains such as mail[.]maskrisks[.]com and checkupdate[.]maskrisks[.]com added for further operational flexibility.</p><h3 id="tag-112s-use-of-cobalt-strike">TAG-112s Use of Cobalt Strike</h3><p>Cobalt Strike is a commercial penetration testing tool that has become a favorite among threat actors due to its versatility and powerful capabilities for remote access, lateral movement, and command-and-control. Insikt Group identified six distinct Cobalt Strike Beacon samples linked to TAG-112, with their C2 communication directed to mail[.]maskrisks[.]com. This malware enables TAG-112 to monitor and control compromised systems, gathering intelligence and potentially leveraging these infected systems for further espionage activities.</p><h3 id="connections-to-tag-102-evasive-panda">Connections to TAG-102 (Evasive Panda)</h3><p>TAG-112 shares several operational characteristics with TAG-102 (Evasive Panda), another <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/chinese-cyberespionage-operations">Chinese APT known for targeting the Tibetan community</a>. Both groups have used similar methods, including spoofed error pages to deliver malicious files. However, TAG-112s operations are less sophisticated than TAG-102, indicating that it may be a subgroup or less experienced branch. For instance, while TAG-102 has deployed customized malware and used obfuscation techniques, TAG-112 relies on the readily available Cobalt Strike tool without obfuscating its JavaScript.</p><p>Despite the lack of obfuscation, TAG-112s tactics and overlaps with TAG-102 highlight the Chinese governments ongoing interest in Tibetan and other ethnic and religious minority communities. Such campaigns are part of a broader strategy of surveillance and control, targeting groups perceived as threats to the stability and control of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).</p><h3 id="mitigation-recommendations">Mitigation Recommendations</h3><p>TAG-112s campaign underscores the importance of proactive cybersecurity measures, particularly for organizations that may be high-value targets for state-sponsored actors. Recorded Future recommends the following steps:</p><ol><li><strong>Intrusion Detection and Prevention</strong>: Configure intrusion detection (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to alert on any indicators of compromise (IoCs) associated with TAG-112. Consider blocking connections to known TAG-112 infrastructure after a thorough review.</li><li><strong>User Training</strong>: Educate users to exercise caution when handling files downloaded from untrusted sources. Advise users against opening files that download automatically without input, as these could be part of phishing or drive-by download attacks.</li><li><strong>Cobalt Strike Detection</strong>: Enable real-time monitoring for malicious Cobalt Strike C2 servers using threat intelligence modules such as Recorded Futures Intelligence Cloud.</li><li><strong>Network Monitoring</strong>: Regularly monitor network traffic for signs of compromise, particularly for connections to known threat infrastructure. Malicious Traffic Analysis (MTA) can help detect unusual activity, alerting security teams to potential C2 communications.</li></ol><h2 id="outlook">Outlook</h2><p>TAG-112s operations against Tibetan organizations reflect a longstanding objective within <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/charting-chinas-climb-leading-global-cyber-power">Chinese cyber-espionage</a> campaigns to monitor and control ethnic and religious minorities, especially those seen as potentially destabilizing. Other groups and regions with similar CCP-designated risk profiles are likely targets of similar state-sponsored attacks.</p><p>To read the entire analysis, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-cn-2024-1112.pdf">click here</a> to download the report as a PDF.</p><h2>Appendix A  Indicators of Compromise</h2><table><tbody><tr><td style="font-family:Courier New;background-color:#ffffff;"><strong>Compromised Websites:</strong><br>tibetpost[.]net<br>gyudmedtantricuniversity[.]org<br><br><strong>C2 Domains:</strong><br>maskrisks[.]com<br>mail[.]maskrisks[.]com<br>update[.]maskrisks[.]com<br>checkupdate[.]maskrisks[.]com<br><br><br><strong>C2 IP Addresses:</strong><br>154.90.62[.]12<br>154.90.63[.]166<br>154.205.138[.]202<br><br><strong>Certificates:</strong><br>d0972247c500d2a45f412f9434287161de395a35ef5b4931cba12cf513b76962(*[.]dnspod[.]cn)<br>94569f64f62eff185ba47e991dba54bdeea6d1a9e205d6bec767be6a864e4efb (Cloudflare Origin *.maskrisks[.]com)<br>d4938cb5c031ec7f04d73d4e75f5db5c8a5c04ce (Stolen code-signing certificate KP MOBILE)<br><br><strong>URLs of malicious JavaScript:</strong><br>https[:]//gyudmedtantricuniversity[.]org/templates/lt_interiordesign/js/custom.js<br>https[:]//tibetpost[.]net/templates/ja_teline_v/js/gallery/jquery.blueimp-gallery.full.js<br><br><strong>Malicious URLs:</strong><br>https[:]//update[.]maskrisks[.]com/download <br>https[:]//update[.]maskrisks[.]com/?type=Chrome<br>https[:]//update[.]maskrisks[.]com/?type=Edge<br>http[:]//mail[.]maskrisks[.]com/api/view.php<br>http[:]//154.205.138[.]202/GetUrl/cache<br>https[:]//checkupdate[.]maskrisks[.]com/cache<br>https[:]//update[.]maskrisks[.]com/cache<br><br><strong>Cobalt Strike:</strong><br>1e42cbe23055e921eff46e5e6921ff1a20bb903fca83ea1f1294394c0df3f4cd<br>0e306c0836a8ee035ae739c5adfbe42bd5021e615ebaa92f52d5d86fb895651d<br>f1f11e52a60e5a446f1eb17bb718358def4825342acc0a41d09a051359a1eb3d<br>f4ded3a67480a0e2a822af1e87a727243dea16ac1a3c0513aec62bff71f06b27<br>966d311dcc598922e4ab9ce5524110a8bfd2c6b6db540d180829ceb7a7253831<br>1e7cb19f77206317c8828f9c3cdee76f2f0ebf7451a625641f7d22bb8c61b21b<br><br><strong>Loaders:</strong><br>8d4049ef70c83a6ead26736c1330e2783bdc9708c497183317fad66b818e44cb<br>E190c7e097a1c38dd45d9c149e737ad9253b1cabee1cee7ef080ddf52d1b378c (legitimate software)<br>31f11b4d81f3ae25b6a01cd1038914f31d045bc4136c40a6221944ea553d6414<br><br></td></tr></tbody></table>            <p><br><br></p><h2>Appendix B  Mitre ATT&CK Techniques</h2><table style="background-color:#ffffff;"><tr><td style="background-color:#0071CE;color:#ffffff;font-weight: 700;"><strong>Tactic: Technique</strong></td><td style="background-color:#0071CE;color:#ffffff;font-weight: 700;"><strong>ATT&CK Code</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Resource Development:</strong> Acquire Infrastructure: Server</td><td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/004/" rel="nofollow noopener">T1583.004</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Resource Development:</strong> Acquire Infrastructure: Web Services</td><td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/006/" rel="nofollow noopener">T1583.006</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Resource Development:</strong> Compromise Infrastructure: Server</td><td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584/004/" rel="nofollow noopener">T1584.004</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Initial Access:</strong> Drive-by Compromise</td><td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189/" rel="nofollow noopener">T1189</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Defense Evasion:</strong> Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Side-Loading</td><td><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002/" rel="nofollow noopener">T1574.002</a></td></tr></table>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Increasingly, attackers don&#39;t hack in anymorethey log in. As enterprises rapidly adopt cloud-based SaaS applications, our security landscape has fundamentally shifted. Identity, not infrastructure, has become the primary target.</p><h2 id="why-identity-is-the-new-battlefield">Why Identity Is the New Battlefield</h2><p>To understand the scale of this identity crisis, let&#39;s look at the data:</p><ul><li>In 2024, credential-based attacks remain the leading cause of data breaches, responsible for <a href="https://blog.1password.com/verizon-data-breach-report-2024-analysis/#:~:text=in%202024%2C%20the%20overwhelming%20majority%20of%20data%20breaches%20can%20still%20be%20traced%20to%20credential%2Dbased%20attacks%20and%20human%20error.">~38% of incidents</a>, significantly outpacing phishing (~17%) and exploits (~16%).

This is a problem because cloud-based apps often have limited security visibility, a growing risk as organizations now use an average of <a href="https://backlinko.com/saas-statistics#:~:text=Organizations%20now%20use%20an%20average%20of%20112%20SaaS%20applications%2C%20up%20from%2016%20in%202017">112 SaaS appsup from just 16 in 2017</a>.</li><li><a href="https://blog.1password.com/verizon-data-breach-report-2024-analysis/#:~:text=use%20of%20stolen%20credentials%E2%80%9D%20is%20the%20number%20one%20initial%20action%20during%20breaches%2C%20and%20stolen%20credentials%20also%20account%20for%20a%20whopping%2077%25%20of%20Basic%20Web%20Application%20Attacks">77%</a> of SaaS application attacks (a subset of web app attacks) begin with stolen credentials.</li></ul><p>This focus on identity-based attacks is amplified by two emerging trends:</p><ol><li>The Rise of Shadow Identities: Employee-driven SaaS adoption has outpaced IT oversight, resulting in unmonitored accounts across organizations.

When employees sign up with basic credentials before IT can establish proper identity management, it can create a dangerous scenario called &quot;<a href="https://github.com/pushsecurity/saas-attacks/blob/main/techniques/ghost_logins/description.md">Ghost Login</a>&quot;where accounts become susceptible to takeover through dual authentication paths.</li></ol><h2 id="the-snowflake-incident-a-warning-sign">The Snowflake Incident: A Warning Sign</h2><p>To understand how these identity vulnerabilities play out in real-world scenarios, we can look at the recent <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/unc5537-snowflake-data-theft-extortion">incident</a> involving a cloud software provider. This incident, which led to millions of records in data exposure for 165 organizations, exposed a dangerous intersection of vulnerabilities that could threaten many SaaS platforms. The attackers exploited three critical weaknesses that exist across today&#39;s SaaS landscape, one of which aligns with Ghost Logins:</p><ul><li>Compromised credentials<a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/unc5537-snowflake-data-theft-extortion#:~:text=Mandiant%20identified%20that%20the%20majority%20of%20the%20credentials%20used%20by%20UNC5537%20were%20available%20from%20historical%20infostealer%20infections%2C%20some%20of%20which%20dated%20as%20far%20back%20as%202020.">some dating back to breaches from 2020</a>.</li><li>Weak or absent MFA: Some victims were susceptible to Ghost Login attacks due to the availability of multiple authentication avenues. </li><li>Widespread application adoption.</li></ul><p>This recipe for compromise is particularly troubling because these three elements are present in so many SaaS applications today.
